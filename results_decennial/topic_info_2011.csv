It also notes the following statements by the Government: () the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez was caused by a young, reckless driver, who hit her while driving against the flow of traffic. The forensic report of the Public Prosecutor s office excludes the possibility that, prior to her fall, she had been hit by an object designed for use by the military or police; () the teachers were arrested for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association for assaulting several police officers with mortar rockets. Due process was respected at all times and, to date, no teacher has been convicted for the aforementioned facts; () the reforms outlined in Decree No.  , of  December , containing the National Social Welfare Institute for Teachers Act were based on actuarial studies carried out by the CNBS, and were disseminated among the teachers' unions in ; () Decree-Law No. -, of  October , suspended the economic regimes established in the different professional statutes, as they are fiscal measures which served as a reference for the automatic and direct increase of salaries, to the detriment of the budgets of centralized and decentralized state institutions; in this respect, the administrative appeal lodged by the SINPRODOH was not successful, since the country s financial situation did not allow for further and greater commitments beyond those contained in the National General Income and Expenditure Budget; () the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department, and this delay (that is the failure to pay on the th day of each month) affected teachers at the national level and their unrest was understandable, which was why the Secretariat issued Decision No. -SE-, of  December , temporarily suspending the voluntary deductions for teachers to Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as union contributions and other legal and court fees. The State Secretariat of the Education Department has acted for many years as a management body to channel the deductions for teachers' unions, in line with requests made by teachers. It sent the circular letter to the six presidents of teachers' organizations belonging to the FOMH, requesting them to report on the amounts, use and handling of funds received. Voluntary deductions were resumed for the teachers' unions that had submitted the reports requested, namely the COPRUMH and the COLPEDAGOGOSH; () the adoption of Decision No. -SE-, of  June , which provides for the extension of the school year in the case of stoppages or suspension of classes, was motivated by the desire to fulfil the right to education and the minimum number of class days; () the State Secretariat of the Labour and Social Security Departments has declared illegal the strikes and protests launched by teachers' representatives in the past two years; consequently, pursuant to national legislation on the disciplinary regime, Executive Decision No. -SE-, of  October , was issued, imposing sanctions involving salary deductions, temporary suspension or dismissal, as the case may be; () the refusal of the requests for renewal of paid union leave made by certain teachers is based on national legislation, which should be applied within the framework of the basic law of each teaching organization determining post duration. In this respect, there was a case in which the request for leave was indeed granted (Mr Grebil Escobar del Cid, Secretary for Finance of PRICPHMA), and another case in which the request for leave was refused because it was requested in order to take up a position that was not part of the executive board (Mr Rufino Murillo, Secretary for Internal Affairs of PRICPHMA). In most cases, the requests for renewal of paid union leave were refused because the time limit set under the regulations of the teacher s organization concerned had been exceeded; () the State Secretariat of the Education Department began a  teacher reorganization' process, which aimed to return teachers assigned to other education establishments to the schools where they had been originally appointed. As a result, needs and vacancies were identified, which led to the redistribution of posts based on the information gathered. The reorganization process was concluded in , the teacher selection boards have now been set up, and representatives from teachers' unions have been included.\n.The Committee notes with profound concern the seriousness of the allegations which include the death of a union activist, criminal proceedings and mass sanctions relating to union activities, and also significant restrictions on the union rights of officials.\n.Regarding the death of Ms Ilse Ivania Velsquez Rodrguez, the Committee observes that, while this highly regrettable event occurred during a demonstration organized by the teachers' organizations of Honduras, it does not seem, according to government statements, to be the result of a violation of the principles of freedom of association. The Committee requests the complainant organizations to provide information in their possession on this allegation and in particular whether her death was, as the Government states, due to a car accident and to indicate whether anyone has been charged or detained in this regard.\n.As regards the legal proceedings instituted against  teachers for the crimes of sedition and unlawful association, and their subsequent arrest, while participating in a peaceful demonstration, the Committee takes note of the statements made by the Government that they assaulted several police officers by throwing mortar rockets at them. The Committee emphasizes that the principles of freedom of association do not protect abuses consisting of criminal acts while exercising the right to strike [see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ]. The Committee regrets the acts of violence that occurred during the demonstration and urges the Government to provide information without delay on the specific acts for which they are being prosecuted, on the status of the legal proceedings instituted and, where applicable, the outcome.\n.Concerning the dispute which is the subject of this complaint, the Committee notes the allegations relating to the suspension of the economic regime set forth in the Honduran Teachers' Statute, under section  of Decree-Law No. -, of  October , and also notes the economic arguments put forward by the Government. The Committee also notes that section  of the above Decree-Law states that:  within a period of  days and subject to negotiation with union organizations, the executive authority shall fix the adjustment to the base salary of public servants governed by special laws or professional statutes, in accordance with the state salary policy, without this increasing the collateral benefits'  As regards the alleged failure to pay the salary increases, the Committee observes that the Government acknowledges that the delay in teachers' monthly payments has been one of the main problems faced by the State Secretariat of the Education Department and that, in view of the situation, the Secretariat issued Decision No. -SE-, of  December , temporarily suspending the voluntary deductions from teachers for Honduran teachers' unions, excluding mandatory dues such as those"", ""the time of sentencing, the court took into account the previous conduct of the accused who had been prosecuted for the offences of illegal currency trafficking, theft, contempt and resistance. He was also officially warned about conduct likely to encourage prostitution. It is false to claim that he is in solitary confinement. Mr Humberto Bello Laffita enjoys the conditions required for Cuban prisons, including the '  ' facility where he is serving his sentence. He has electricity, water and the possibility of making telephone calls and receiving visits from family members; (vii) Mr Yunier Herrera Rodrguez: it is false to state that he was arrested for peacefully claiming trade union rights. He was arrested when found inebriated on the public highway shouting abusive phrases, totally unrelated to labour or trade union matters; (viii) lastly the Government denies the allegations that seven ASIC activists and officials were arrested in early February  and rejects the allegations of interrogation or detention concerning Luis Orlando Len Randich and Yaqueln Snchez Batista.\n.With regard to the disturbances that occurred on  July , referred to in the allegation letter, the Government indicates, in its communication dated  October , that: (i) peace was disturbed for the deliberate purpose of subverting the constitutional order. There was a very serious incitement to violence in the country, causing injuries and endangering collective security and the lives of citizens, officials and law enforcement officers. Property and facilities were damaged and destroyed; (ii) no one was arrested or punished for exercising their constitutionally recognized rights, including their labour and trade union rights; and (iii) the ILO complaints mechanism cannot be used to settle issues unrelated to alleged violations of freedom of association. There is an attempt to make people believe that there is a  wave of repression' in the country against alleged independent trade unionists, which is doubly false, given that there is neither repression nor are the persons mentioned in the allegation submitted trade unionists.\n.The Government indicates that, since the receipt of the communication of  April , a thorough investigation has been conducted into the list of persons submitted as an annex. There is no evidence of the dissemination of this alleged list of workers, let alone that anyone has been threatened because of it or because it was drawn up. In particular, the alleged threats to Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez have not been proven.\n.The Committee recalls that this complaint concerns several allegations of acts of aggression, harassment, persecution, arrests, assault and restrictions on the free movement of trade union officials and members while carrying out their functions by state security forces. The complainant also denounces its non-recognition by the Government.\n.As regards recommendation (a) (recognition and free operation of ASIC), the Committee notes that the Government once again stresses that: (i) ASIC is not a trade union organization; ASIC members do not have employment relationships, do not belong to any labour collective and therefore have not been elected or appointed by the members as trade union representatives; they do not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests, nor do they have the genuine support of the membership or any labour collective; and (ii) its supposed members answer to a foreign government, which provides them with funds in the political aim of subverting the legitimately established internal order.\n.In this regard, the Committee firstly recalls that, for several decades, it has been examining allegations of non-recognition and interference by the Government in the free operation of trade union organizations not affiliated to the Confederation of Workers of Cuba [see Cases Nos , , ,  and  of the Committee on Freedom of Association]. The Committee also recalls that the right to official recognition through legal registration is an essential facet of the right to organize since this is the first step that workers' or employers' organizations must take in order to be able to function efficiently, and represent their members adequately; and a long registration procedure constitutes a serious obstacle to the establishment of organizations and amounts to a denial of the right of workers to establish organizations without previous authorization. It further recalls that freedom of association implies the right of workers and employers to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organize their administration and activities without any interference by the public authorities [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , paras ,  and ]. Considering that, according to the information provided by the complainant, some trade union members and officials mentioned in the complaint were self-employed workers, and that others had been dismissed for anti-union reasons, the Committee secondly recalls that that the criterion for determining the persons covered by the right to organize is not based on the existence of an employment relationship. Workers who do not have employment contracts should have the right to form the organizations of their choosing if they so wish [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee reiterates that in its initial examination of this case, it had noted that ASIC, in its founding declaration of principles, advocates trade union autonomy in the framework of the rule of law, aims to promote full compliance with ILO international labour standards and proclaims that it will not compromise or associate itself with party-political activities. In its union constitution, ASIC states that its key objectives include grouping together independent trade unions and reporting violations of international labour standards. Moreover, ASIC members' duties as set out in the union constitution include defending workers' claims and benefits. It is in this context that the Committee observes that the elements of ASIC s declaration of principles and union constitution fall within the scope of action and definition of a workers' organization. The Committee can only regret that there has been no progress since its last examination of this case and therefore once again refers to its previous conclusions and once more strongly urges the Government to ensure that ASIC is given recognition, and that it can freely operate and carry out its trade union activities.\n.Regarding recommendation (b) (investigations into the allegations of acts of aggression and restrictions on public freedoms with respect to certain union activists and officials), the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication dated  October , provides information about the members identified in the said recommendation, indicating or reiterating that the persons in question: (i) do not have, or have not had, employment relationships (Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Ms Ariadna Mena, Mr Ral Domingo Zerguera Borren, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Ms Yadislandia Hurtado Bicet, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene); (ii) continue to engage in inappropriate social behaviour and/or have committed offences, including public order offences (Mr Osvaldo Arcis Hernndez, Mr Brbaro Tejeda Snchez, Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Pavel Herrera Hernndez, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Willian Cruz Delgado, Mr Roque Ivn Martnez Baldarran, Mr Jefferson Ismael Polo Mezerene, Ms Anairis Dania Mezerene, Mr Ulises Rafael Hernndez Lpez); (iii) have never been subject to police action, such as arrests, ill treatment and isolation, or any other kind of action such as travel restrictions (Mr Felipe Carrera Hernndez, Mr Ral Domingo Zerguera Borren, Mr Reinaldo Cosano Aln, Mr Daniel Perea Garca, Mr Lisan Zamora Ricardo, Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez, Ms Consuelo Rodriguez Hernndez, Ms Mailn Ricardo Gngora); (iv) reside overseas (Ms Hilda Aylin Lpez Salazar, Mr Pave Herrera Hernndez, Mr Lzaro Ricardo Prez, Mr Hiosvani Pupo, Mr Yuvisley Roque Rajadel, Mr Dannery Gmez Galeto, Ms Aime de las Mercedes Cabrera lvarez); (v) have died (Mr Pedro Scull); and/or (vi) have already been subject to comments by the Government (Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo, Mr Emilio Gottardi Gottardi, Mr Willian Cruz Delgado, Mr Ramn Zamora Rodrguez, Mr Yisan Zamora Ricardo, Mr Humberto Jos Bello Laffita).\n.While taking due note of the Government s reply, the Committee cannot fail to observe the numerous additional allegations made by the complainant regarding the commission of new acts of anti-union discrimination, in particular arbitrary arrests, threats of deprivation of liberty and various acts of harassment against ASIC members and officials. The Committee notes that ASIC even reports intensified repression by state security agencies against its union officials and activists, with the declared objective of putting an end to ASIC.\n.The Committee notes in this respect that, in the numerous communications received since its last examination of the present case, the complainant alleges that ASIC members and officials are constantly subjected to threats and to frequent brief but arbitrary and intimidating arrests by state security agencies, including: the trade union activist Mr Juan Alberto de la Nuez Ramrez; the activist Mr Leonardo Hernndez Camejo; ASIC general secretary in the province of Holgun and his family; ASIC provincial secretary, Mr Ibn Guerra Hernndez, and his wife Ms Kety Martnez; ASIC national executive member, Mr Carlos Roberto Reyes Consuegras; ASIC representative Ms Consuelo Rodrguez Hernndez and her husband Mr"", ""dialogue and cooperation for the effective promotion of workers' rights, undermine tripartism and do not help improve the situation of workers in the world. Furthermore, it considers that these negative practices are inconsistent with the principles of objectivity, impartiality and non-selectiveness that should prevail in the handling of trade union freedoms. The Government therefore anticipates that it will be possible, on the basis of the elements submitted in its observations, to dismiss all of the allegations relating to the present case as baseless.\n.With regard to recommendation (a), the Government states once again that ASIC is not a trade union organization, given that: (i) it does not have the objective of promoting or defending workers' interests; (ii) it does not have the genuine support of any labour collective and is not a grouping of Cuban workers; (iii) the supposed leaders or activists referred to in the complaint do not represent labour collectives and are not workers themselves, as they do not have fixed employment relationships with entities or employers in Cuba, thus they do not come within the purview of the ILO, and the labour laws are therefore not applicable to them; (iv) the Government of the United States, through the International Group for Corporate Social Responsibility and the American organization National Endowment for Democracy, funds ASIC leaders, who, in exchange for a sum of money, have to pose as independent trade union activists, dissidents or critics of the Government and report false violations of workers' rights; (v) the  Labour Code (Act No.  of ) includes as its fundamental principles the right of workers to organize voluntarily and establish trade unions; (vi) the trade union organizations that make up the Confederation of Workers of Cuba (CTC) are autonomous and their members approve their own statutes and regulations, discuss and reach agreements democratically, and elect or dismiss their executives; (vii) national unions have ,, members and . per cent of Cuban workers are unionized; and (viii) Cuban workers are the beneficiaries of participatory and democratic social dialogue at all decision-making levels.\n.With regard to recommendation (b), the Government indicates that the persons mentioned in the complaint have engaged in antisocial and criminal behaviour. It denies that any arbitrary or temporary detentions or arrests are carried out because these are effected in conformity with the criminal procedure in force and are strictly in line with the guarantees of due process that are recognized in the domestic legal system. It further indicates that institutions and security forces perform their duties in strict accordance with the law and it is not their practice to repress, intimidate, harass, torture or mistreat citizens. It recalls that the internal system provides procedures and resources to punish any authority or official overstepping its powers.\n.Concerning the individual cases mentioned by the complainant, the Government states that:(a)\tit is untrue that Mr Ivn Hernndez Carrillo is a political prisoner: (i) the chamber for crimes against state security of the People s Provincial Court of Havana found him guilty in  of the offence of acts against the independence and territorial integrity of the State, provided for in the Act on the Protection of National Independence and the Economy of Cuba (Act No.  of ), and sentenced him to  years' imprisonment; (ii) on  March , he was granted parole (his conviction will expire in the first half of ); (iii) he cannot travel outside the country under article (b) of the Migration Act (Act No.  of , as amended by Decree Law No.  of ); and (iv) in July , September  and March , three charges were brought against him for disobedience, incitement to commit a crime and contempt, which are offences provided for in the Criminal Code (Act No.  of ), which the Cuban authorities decided to handle as minor offences (with the imposition of administrative measures, including fines and specific obligations and prohibitions);(b)\tMr Carlos Reyes Consuegras, who also has no employment relationship, was prosecuted for illegal gambling and administrative proceedings were also filed against him for the illegal rental of a home and a fine imposed for the illegal possession of psychotropic substances. In addition, he was twice prosecuted for illicit economic activities. With regard to action taken against him by the immigration authorities, this was because of his past record of antisocial and criminal behaviour. He has never been arrested, but simply interviewed, fully respecting the guarantees provided by law;(c)\tMr Jorge Anglada Mayeta was not beaten up by a police officer while trying to defend a self-employed worker. Mr Anglada pounced on and assaulted a police officer carrying out his duties without prior warning or legitimate cause, which constitutes an offence in criminal legislation throughout the world. On  February , the Municipal People s Court of La Habana Vieja, having respected all guarantees of due process, found him guilty of assault and sentenced him to two years' imprisonment with a restriction of liberty order for an equal period of time;(d)\tMr Vctor Manuel Domnguez Garca, Mr Wilfredo lvarez Garca, Mr Brbaro de la Nuez Ramrez, Mr Alexis Gmez Rodrguez, Mr Roberto Arsenio Lpez Ramos and Mr Charles Enchris Rodrguez Ledezma were prosecuted following allegations relating to acts classified as offences under Cuban legislation (illicit economic activities, illegal gambling, possession of psychotropic substances, speculation and hoarding, possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, usurpation of public office, handling stolen goods, contempt, causing serious injury, damage, forgery of documents and public disorder). Given that domestic legislation allows for conduct of low risk to society to be subject to administrative proceedings, the authorities handled the above as minor offences;(e)\tcriminal proceedings were not instituted against Mr Eduardo Enrique Hernndez Toledo because he was allegedly exercising his trade union rights, and neither did the authorities commit any acts of persecution or harassment against him. The aforementioned person is not a trade union leader and has never been subjected to harassment or pressure by the authorities. He was prosecuted by the People s Municipal Court of Trinidad for contempt and sentenced to a one-year prison term with custodial hard labour, and is currently out on parole;(f)\tMr Yoanny Limonta Garca, who is also not a union official and has no employment relationship, was subjected to police checks because of his repeated commission of acts classified as offences and other antisocial behaviour (in  for speculation, in  for possession, production and sale of instruments for the purpose of committing crimes, and in  for usurpation of public office);(g)\tMr Mateo Moreno Ramn and Mr Leandro Vladimir Aguilera Pea were not arrested; they simply received warnings from the relevant authorities, in strict compliance with the law, to prevent them from carrying out their criminal intentions;(h)\tthe restrictions on the right to free movement of Mr Osvaldo Rodrguez Daz and Mr Alejandro Snchez Zaldvar were implemented in accordance with current migration legislation. Mr Snchez Zaldvar has had no employment relationship since  and has a long history of violation of existing rules, regulations and laws, including allegations of illegal economic activities and disobedience. The allegations of threats and harassment against him and his wife are also untrue. Mr Snchez Zaldvar has participated in several trade union events and workshops abroad funded by a foreign power. In , as part of his activities against Cuba, he travelled to Geneva in the context of the th International Labour Conference. During the current year, his freedom to travel has not been arbitrarily restricted and the authorities have acted only in accordance with migration law(i)\tMs Magela Garcs Ramrez wrote and disseminated an article in which she made serious and groundless accusations against a significant number of artists and art institutions and, given the seriousness of the allegations, her employer decided that she should work for a different art collection, which is why she decided to resign from her post; and(j)\tMs Sara Cuba Delgado was not subjected to surveillance and harassment by state officials.\n.With respect to the restrictions on ASIC members and officials travelling and participating in international events, the Government indicates that current migration legislation determines the grounds on which the authorities may restrict the right of a citizen to leave the country and this power is exercised by the relevant authorities in a non-arbitrary manner and respecting legal guarantees. It also denies preventing certain persons from leaving their homes during the  May celebrations or imposing house arrests.\n.With regard to recommendation (c) concerning the exercise of the right to strike in practice, the Government states that current legislation does not include any prohibition of this right and that criminal legislation does not provide for any penalty for exercising this right. The fact that workers do not use this mechanism is not due to a legislative prohibition but to the fact that they have the option of resorting to other more effective means at their disposal, including a number of different forms of meaningful participation and the exercise of genuine decision-making power on matters that concern them. Furthermore, the protection of trade""]"

The state copper enterprise adds that, at the time of the dismissals,  per cent of the workers were trade union members and were registered with the primary trade union affiliated to the CTC (to date these figures still stand)); (ii) regarding the move to reprimand the Gardilcic Andina trade union,  per cent of the associates requested the Labour Inspectorate to provide a certifying officer to take part in the process of reprimanding the union leadership. After a public notice of a meeting had been posted, a decision to reprimand the union leadership was adopted by a vote on  November  (in which  men and  women participated). The Government explains that the Labour Inspectorate does not interfere in the validation of the grounds of a reprimand and that, in the event of false accusations, it is the responsibility of the organization itself to annul the reprimand or adopt measures to resolve any conflict arising within the organization. All requests to annul a leadership reprimand are dealt with by the labour courts; (iii) the illegal replacement of striking workers participating in the collective bargaining process of the integral services was recorded by the Chaara Labour Inspectorate and reported to the Directorate of Labour, which, in turn, submitted a complaint of anti-union practices to the Labour Court, which resulted in an agreement approved by the court on  March  and the closure of the case on  May ; and (iv) as for the allegation that the maintenance service contractor in the El Teniente division refused to engage in collective bargaining, it did so under section  of the existing Labour Code, that is to say it raised an objection relating to time limits and a lack of opportunity to enter into bargaining, which was accepted by the Rancagua Labour Inspectorate.\n.With regard to the possible effects of the CTC s criticism of the labour reform, the Government understands that the organization has a legitimate right to disagree with the Government s views when the latter introduces legislation on collective bargaining and to promote a complete revision of Chapter IV of the Labour Code.\n.The enterprise denies the allegations that it used direct or indirect psychological pressure or physical force on workers during the bargaining process, and submits that the general accusations levelled against it are not based on specific facts, but on assertions of interference by the State in this regard. The enterprise also denies having committed acts of union interference, reiterating that these, too, are unsubstantiated accusations. With regard to the mass dismissals of the contracting enterprises' workers who were involved in the strike, the enterprise, as the principal in the subcontracting system, states that it does not intervene in the dismissals of the contracting enterprises' employees. Its sole interaction with the contracting enterprises is limited to establishing, in advance, the tendering terms which are ultimately transferred to the resulting civil-law contract, which are also signed by the contracting enterprises, as any further involvement in the management and administration of each enterprise s human resources would be inappropriate. The enterprise states that the complaint does not contain any factual evidence of collaboration to undermine trade union activity and that, to the contrary, it has acted as a mediator or facilitator of agreements and intervened only when it was possible to promote agreement between the parties which might be linked to matters within its remit as principal, without interfering in trade union or worker organization matters in the processes mentioned above.\n.With respect to the public monument in memory of Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, the Government indicates that the situation which arose during the process to authorize its construction stemmed from the actions or decisions of either the Council for National Monuments or the Ministry of National Assets, in which the enterprise played no part. Although the authorization and putting in place of the memorial undermined the legitimate exercise of a right in rem associated with the mining easement owned exclusively by the enterprise, the monument has been built and set up in that location without waiting for the orders which revoked the authorization.\n.The Committee notes that, in this case, the Confederation of Copper Workers (CTC), which comprises workers in a subordinate and dependent relationship with contracting enterprises of the enterprise, denounces the excessive use of police force during a lawful strike held between  July and  August , that resulted in the death of a worker, and it also alleges that during negotiations to improve and expand the framework agreement concluded in  between the CTC, the enterprise and the contracting enterprises, various anti-union practices occurred in several of these enterprises.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the complainant: (i) on  August , a framework agreement was concluded between the CTC, the enterprise and the contracting enterprises (according to the complainant, the enterprise, dominates the contracting enterprises); (ii) this framework is the only supra-enterprise collective instrument that embodies rights and obligations relating to the workers' remuneration and social protection;; (iii) although the framework agreement does not specify a renewal date, it was extended through negotiations in ,  and , that is to say within the minimum periods established in the national legislation for the renewal of collective instruments, meaning that negotiations should have been conducted in ; and (iv) on  July , the CTC submitted an application for the enforcement, improvement and extension of the agreement and, faced with the reluctance of the enterprise and its contracting enterprises to start the negotiation process (they argued that the negotiations should be held in , not , and that the enterprise was facing a difficult economic situation due to internal production conditions and the low price of copper), the CTC launched a lawful strike on  July .\n.In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s contention that: (i) the drop in the price of copper has significantly affected the copper industry in recent years, leading to job losses and the discontinuance of projects and investments; (ii) Chilean legislation recognizes only one binding and compulsory level of negotiation: the enterprise level (supra-enterprise negotiation is essentially voluntary); (iii) while the framework agreement between the enterprise, the contracting enterprises and the CTC was concluded on  August , the complementary agreements negotiated in ,  and  were concluded between the CTC and the contracting enterprises which form the Professional Association of Mining Enterprises and Related Industries (AGEMA). The enterprise participated in these negotiations only as a facilitator and guarantor; and (iv) on  July , the CTC broached the possibility of direct negotiation with the enterprise, thus breaking with the parties' previous practice. On being faced with this situation, the enterprise responded that this request should be settled directly between the contract workers, their representative trade union organizations and the respective enterprises employing them, at which point the CTC began to put pressure on the state enterprise, calling a stoppage that would result in the occupation of facilities and the blocking of a public road.\n.In relation to the alleged excessive use of police force during a lawful strike held between  July and  August , that resulted in the death of a worker, the Committee notes that, according to the CTC, the Government and the police report annexed to the complaint, on  July, the Chilean paramilitary police force carried out an operation in the El Salvador division, which resulted in the death of the worker Mr Nelson Quichillao Lpez, who died of a gunshot wound in the early hours of the next day. The Committee notes that according to the CTC and the Government, two investigations are being conducted in order to clarify the circumstances surrounding his death: one by the paramilitary police force (which, according to the complainant, lacks credibility, legitimacy and impartiality) and another by the Public Prosecutor s Office, in which the CTC is the complainant. The Committee notes that to date, both investigations are ongoing. It also notes the Government s statement that, with a view to further clarifying the facts, the National Human Rights Institute has filed a criminal complaint against those responsible for the death of the worker Nelson Quichillao Lpez. The Committee recalls that in cases in which the dispersal of public meetings by the police has involved loss of life or serious injury, the Committee has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated immediately through an independent inquiry and to a regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification for the action taken by the police and to determine responsibilities (see Digest of decisions and principles of the Freedom of Association Committee, fifth (revised) edition, , para. ). The Committee deeply regrets the death of the worker Nelson Quichillao Lpez and urges the Government to keep"", ""the Tiger-Sepam enterprise dismissed some  USO members.\n.With regard to the Propilco workers, the complainants allege that: (i) in May ,  workers who were providing services in that enterprise through temporary employment agencies became members of the USO and were immediately dismissed on the pretext that the commercial contract between those enterprises and Propilco had been terminated, a tactic which had been used on various occasions to prevent workers in the sector from joining the USO; (ii) in July , the enterprise and one of its subsidiaries rejected the list of demands presented by the USO, arguing that they are not part of the oil industry; (iii) on  August , the enterprise dismissed Miguel Pacheco, who had been chosen to negotiate the list of demands; (iv) as a result of the list of demands, the enterprise and its subsidiary instituted legal proceedings to request that the USO s statutory reform be declared illegal, that the enterprises be exonerated from the obligation to negotiate the list of demands and that the USO be ordered to pay the personal and material damages arising from trade union membership; (v) on  September , the USO s Cartagena subcommittee filed a complaint against Ecopetrol, as the main enterprise, and against Propilco before the Public Prosecution Service for violation of freedom of association and collective bargaining; and (vi) on  May , Edilberto Ulloque, the last remaining USO member in the enterprise, was dismissed due to instances of alleged misconduct years earlier.\n.Based on the events described in the paragraphs above, the complainants conclude their allegations by denouncing the following violations of ILO Conventions Nos  and : (i) the violation of freedom of opinion and expression through the restriction of the circulation of the USO newsletters, the dismissal of workers for having distributed them, the hiding of USO banners and the stigmatization of union officials who filed labour complaints; (ii) restrictions on the right to join trade unions, not only due to the aforementioned restrictions on the circulation of trade union information but also due to the temporary nature of contracts, which allows enterprises to demand that workers give up their USO membership to obtain the signature or renewal of their contracts and, lastly, due to pressure to join another union, known for its close relationship with the employers; (iii) lack of protection against anti-union discrimination, in particular against the practice of blacklisting, threats of non-renewal of fixed-term contracts without the existence of adequate mechanisms to provide fast and effective protection against such acts. In this regard, the complainant alleges that complaints filed before the labour inspectorate take two to three years to be examined; (iv) the violation of the right to strike, in so far as the labour legislation (in particular section (h) of the Labour Code) continues to prohibit strikes in the oil sector and that -hour work stoppages organized by workers in the sector lead to disproportionate police repression, non-renewal of the contracts of workers that participate in them, and stigmatization.\n.In a communication of February , the Government transmits the replies of the Ecopetrol, Meta Petroleum Corp., Petrominerales, Reficar and Cepcolsa enterprises. In its reply, Ecopetrol indicates that: (i) the allegations regarding the group s contracting policy (using contractor enterprises and contracts limited to specific projects) do not concern freedom of association or the content of ILO Conventions Nos  and  and are, therefore, outside the Committee s mandate; (ii) the organization s allegations are based on vague complaints without reference to concrete evidence; (iii) the allegations of anti-union disciplinary proceedings against union officials and members do not tally with the reality, since the single disciplinary code (applicable to the enterprise s direct employees since they hold public servant status) does not indicate that union membership or activity provides grounds for disciplinary action; (iv) entry into safe areas is regulated in order to protect the persons working there, and the disciplinary inquiries referred to in the complaint do not constitute anti-union persecution but instead seek to ensure that industrial safety standards are met; (v) the enterprise respects the unions' right to circulate their newsletter and other information; however, certain trade union activities during working hours and in workplaces, without the enterprise s authorization, can result in work stoppages and affect the trade union rights of other workers; (vi) the USO, without regard for constitutional and legal considerations, has been promoting work stoppages in an enterprise which provides an essential public service (see ruling C- of  of the Constitutional Court); (vii) in addition, constant work stoppages make a mockery of the five-year collective agreement signed in  by Ecopetrol and the USO and violate the principle of bargaining in good faith; (viii) the work stoppage on  November  ' which continued until  November ' was not peaceful, and required the intervention of the police in order to maintain public order and safeguard the enterprise s premises; (ix) Agreement No.  of , recognized by the Council of State, does not provide for wages above those in the collective labour agreement; (x) the accusations that video cameras were installed on the enterprise s premises in order to take disciplinary action against unionized workers are false since the cameras were installed purely for security reasons; (xi) more generally, Ecopetrol reaffirms its commitment to developing collective labour relations based on mutual trust, as illustrated by the Agreement to promote relationships of trust, signed on  April  with the USO and other stakeholders; the Ecopetrol-USO collective agreement for the period ' ; and the agreement on dismissed workers (collective labour dispute ' ) and the agreement on enterprise, production and worker welfare development, signed that same year.\n.In its reply, Meta Petroleum Corp. indicates that: (i) it is responsible for operations in the Quifa and Rubiales oilfields, while Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. is a Canadian enterprise which does not exist in Colombia and which does not have employees in the country, therefore it is impossible, both in fact and in law, for Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. to violate freedom of association in Colombia; (ii) there are no USO members under contract with Meta Petroleum Corp. and the enterprise has not been notified by the USO of any of its workers becoming USO members; (iii) the enterprise has always had internal mechanisms to address the demands of its workers; furthermore, the enterprise encourages its subcontractor enterprises to address the demands of their own workers; (iv) the various work stoppages initiated by workers of contractor and subcontractor enterprises were not preceded by the presentation of a list of demands nor by the notification of specific complaints or demands. Instead, the USO took the law into its own hands and proceeded to stage a violent work stoppage on  July . This not only violated the freedom of movement and the right to work of employees in the field but also endangered the security of the entire community by not complying with the industrial security requirements for operations in oil fields; (v) the enterprise restricted access to the oil field to avoid acts of violence; (vi) the USO members who entered the oil field did not act like union officials but like agitators, encouraging violence, damaging property and injuring workers; (vii) as a result of these acts, various contractor enterprises filed criminal complaints with the Public Prosecution Service, which are currently under examination; (viii) notwithstanding the above, the enterprise agreed to engage in dialogue with the USO on  July , which resulted in an agreement which the enterprise strictly adhered to; (ix) however, the USO broke with that agreement by carrying out further violent acts in the oil field in September and October ; (x) in view of the serious danger and vandalism in Campos Rubiales and Quifa, a staff entry and exit policy was adopted and applied to everyone, regardless of trade union membership, but with the requirement of being under contract with a contractor or subcontractor enterprise; (xi) the termination by the enterprise of the other civil or commercial contracts with contractor enterprises is part of the standard contracting system and the nature of activities carried out on the oil field, and it is totally unrelated to the exercise of freedom of association; (xii) on  October , the enterprise signed an agreement with the Union of Workers of the National Energy Industry and Domestic Public Services (UTEN) to standardize the labour activities which make the enterprise s contractors and subcontractors entitled to non-statutory and wage benefits; the number of UTEN members exceeds  per cent of the enterprise s workers, the relationship between the enterprise and UTEN is one of respect enabling the conclusion of collective and labour agreements, as was the case in ,  and ; (xiii) the enterprise has never induced anyone to give up their trade union membership, as attested by the increase in the number of the unionized workers in the enterprise (, additional members between January  and February ); (xiv) neither the enterprise"", ""than the collective agreements, that it applied solely to non-unionized employees in the enterprise (not to executives or directors), who constituted  per cent of the total number of employees, and that the practice did not have a negative impact on the trade union membership rate and its emphasis on the fact that the average remuneration of unionized workers is greater than that of non-unionized workers. The enterprise also states that following a complaint lodged with SUNAFIL, the latter confirmed that the salary and benefits review does not constitute a practice that violates freedom of association. Noting the enterprise s indication that the average remuneration of unionized workers is greater than that of non-unionized workers, the Committee observes that it does not have sufficient information and elements at its disposal to be able to effectively compare the two existing salary and benefits  structures' in the enterprise and evaluate the impact that they might have on one another. In any event, the Committee observes that in a situation in which collective agreements are not applicable to all workers in an enterprise and there is a wage structure applicable to workers whose remuneration is not fixed by collective bargaining, it is important to ensure that such a structure neither has a detrimental effect on collective bargaining processes nor discourages trade union membership in the enterprise.\n.With regard to the allegation that neither the collective agreement nor the wages and benefits policy applies to unionized executive workers in the enterprise, the Committee notes the enterprise s indication that the national legislation (section  of the TUO-LRCT) provides that collective agreements do not apply to those who occupy management posts or hold positions of trust. In this respect, the Committee notes that the '  collective agreement signed between the SUTTP and the enterprise stipulates that the benefits agreed therein are granted exclusively to members of the union. The Committee also notes that in , the MTPE issued a technical opinion on the application of a collective agreement to workers in positions of trust in the enterprise in question who are members of another trade union operating therein. The Committee notes that the technical opinion, published on the Ministry s website, states that: (i) an isolated reading of section  of the TUO-LRCT, which excludes from the scope of a collective agreement workers in positions of trust who are members of the trade union organization that concluded the collective agreement, is contrary to the freedom of association enshrined in the Political Constitution for the benefit of workers, including those in positions of trust; and (ii) with further reference to Conventions Nos  and , it finds that the collective agreement is applicable to workers in positions of trust in the enterprise who are members of the trade union organization that concluded the agreement. The Committee notes these different elements which point to the existence of an ongoing debate on the applicability of collective agreements to staff in management posts or positions of trust. With regard to the rights to collective bargaining, the Committee recalls that this right should be guaranteed to trade unions representing all kinds of workers. Noting that, according to the enterprise, the applicability of the agreement signed with the SUTTP is under way before the courts, the Committee expects that the courts have ruled taking into due account both the will expressed by the parties to the agreement in question and the criteria set out above with regard to the personal scope of collective bargaining.\n.The Committee notes that another of the elements in respect of which the complainant organization expresses concern relates to the transfer of workers to the area known as the COT, since, it claims, the enterprise had not only undertaken in the collective agreement to protect employability in a climate of respect and calm, but that almost all the transferred workers were unionized. The Committee notes the enterprise s assertion that the transfers were justified on objective grounds and that, given that a clear majority of staff in the enterprise is unionized, it is logical that in the COT the majority of staff should also be unionized.\n.The Committee observes that both the complainant organization and the Government indicate that SUNAFIL conducted several inspections of the enterprise in relation to the transfers to the COT. The Committee notes the content of the inspection reports appended by the Government and observes that, while in one of them SUNAFIL stated that in the COT there were both unionized and non-unionized staff, that report contains a list of COT staff which shows that only  of the  workers were not affiliated to a trade union. The Committee also observes that in the reports SUNAFIL: noted that the transferred workers retained the same category and remuneration as previously; observed that the transfer corresponded to a restructuring plan for the enterprise which was not intended to harm the workers in any way; found that trade union leave and deductions of union dues had been granted; and concluded that freedom of association had not been violated. The Committee also observes that, while the complainant organization alleges that a performance evaluation system was introduced that was applicable primarily to the COT, with penalties ranging up to dismissal, the complaint does not indicate whether there have been any disciplinary sanctions or dismissals of unionized or non-unionized workers. Further noting that SUNAFIL has carried out checks with respect to this area, the Committee expects that the competent authorities will continue to ensure that the practice at the COT does not affect the exercise of freedom of association.\n.The Committee notes that the complainant organization also alleges that, while complaints are lodged with SUNAFIL, the country does not have an effective procedure for monitoring violations linked to the protection of freedom of association.\n.The Committee takes due note of the concerns expressed by the complainant organization regarding the time involved in investigations (over two months spent on the investigation stage), and the lack of specialized knowledge in the area of freedom of association, and notes the Government s statements whereby: (i) inspection activities are carried out within a maximum time frame of  days, which only in exceptional cases may be extended for a further  days; (ii) the labour inspection regulations have been adjusted over time; (iii) during the period ' ,  inspections were carried out at the enterprise ( relating to collective labour relations and  on discrimination based on union affiliation of which  resulted in a violation report); and (iv) in February , SUNAFIL introduced a register of trade union organizations in the virtual complaints system which allows the representatives of these organizations to follow up on complaints lodged. Bearing in mind that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) is monitoring the role of SUNAFIL in respect of anti-union discrimination in the context of the application of Convention No. , the Committee invites the Government to continue to provide information in this context on the measures adopted to improve the effectiveness of inspection activities in the area of trade union rights.\n.The Committee observes that both the complainant organization and the Government indicate that, at the time they submitted their communications, various court proceedings were under way relating to several of the topics raised in the complaint, including alleged non-compliance with various provisions of the '  collective agreement and the transfer of workers to the COT. The Committee does not have any information concerning the results of these court proceedings. While it recalls that agreements should be binding on the parties [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ], the Committee observes that, according to publicly available information, on  June  the enterprise signed an agreement which settled various claims with a number of trade union organizations, including the claims submitted by the SUTTP corresponding to the periods ' , '  and ' . The Committee hopes that these agreements have clarified a number of the issues raised in the complaint and, trusting that the above-mentioned judicial proceedings have been concluded, urges the parties to strengthen the existing forums for dialogue within the enterprise so that any outstanding issues can be submitted for open dialogue conducted in good faith.\n.Lastly, the Committee notes that the complainant organization also alleges that the Government has introduced regulatory provisions that substantially weaken social dialogue, mentioning as examples decrees issued in  and  by means of which: (i) the PNCP was allegedly approved without it having been the subject of consultations in the CNTPE; (ii) the representativeness of workers on the Executive Board of the CNCF was allegedly amended, with just one of the  representatives who constitute the CNCF representing workers; and (iii) the same decree allegedly established public rivate technical committees for the development of the various aspects of the PNCP without making provision for the presence of trade union representatives in their composition, despite the fact that one technical committee""]"

It was not until January  that an arbitration tribunal issued an arbitral award against which an appeal has been filed with the Supreme Court. The complainant adds that, throughout that period of time, the company promoted its own collective agreement signed with non-union workers and managed to ensure that the tribunal s arbitral award was based on the few rights contained in that agreement and not on SINALTRAINAL s list of demands. It also states that the company dismissed, in a discriminatory manner, the workers Luis Manuel Martnez Sotelo, Blanca Elena Bustos, Mariola Molina Gonzlez, Agripina Prez Prez, Mario Augusto Pinto Jimnez and Carmen Cotera Monerroza and that the courts refused to order their reinstatement in decisions of  August and  September .\n.Moreover the complainant holds that: (i) the company Distraves SAS (hereinafter  the poultry company'  brought criminal proceedings against SINALTRAINAL and a number of workers for the allegedly fraudulent registration of workers as members of the trade union; (ii) the complaint was filed after the company had refused to discuss the list of demands submitted by the trade union on  July , which was also the date on which a number of company workers joined the trade union; (iii) as from that date, the company unleashed a systematic campaign of harassment directed against trade union members; (iv) as part of this campaign, Leonardo Plata Mendoza, Estewinson Pico Caldern, Alberto Snchez Castro and Jiovanny Snchez Buitrago were dismissed without a valid reason on  August ; and (v) on  August , Norberto Rueda Barragn, a member of the committee negotiating the list of demands, was also dismissed.\n.The complainant alleges that the administrative authorities to which SINALTRAINAL had turned in order to denounce the aforementioned acts of anti-union discrimination endorsed those practices, but without requiring the union to pay the penalties or compensation which some judicial authorities had ordered in decisions devoid of any legal validity and which completely failed to protect freedom of association. The complainant adds that, although Colombian legislation makes provision for some remedies for breaches of freedom of association, the process of obtaining the remedies is expensive, slow and ineffective and, what is more, the authorities implement these remedies only in part in an opaque manner.\n.The complainant also adds that bringing criminal charges against SINALTRAINAL leaders constitutes an anti-union strategy which has been deployed for many years by bottling plants in Colombia and which is still continuing. In this connection, the complainant makes particular mention of: (i) criminal charges filed by a bottling plant in Medelln against the SINALTRAINAL leaders Helconides Londoo Restrepo, Duban Antinio Mejia, Jhon Jairo Tamayo Nieto, Juan David Florez Contreras, Carlos Alsonso Yepes Gil, Rafael Aderlis Castro and Jaime Alonso Caas Montoya for allegedly illegal acts committed at a rally on  August , and another complaint lodged with the Ministry of Labour alleging abuse of the right of freedom of association on grounds of alleged damage to the company s business premises on that date; (ii) criminal charges against the trade union for the publication, in September , of a text satirizing the multinational s acts of anti union harassment; (iii) the criminal charges brought against the SINALTRAINAL leaders Luis Fernando Miranda Velzquez, Fabian Adolfo Ortiz Burbano, Alirio Nuez Garca, Lizarso Serrano Hernndez, Orlando Enrique Ciacedo Orozco, Miguel Enrique Pua Orellano, Paulo Cesar Valencia Guerrero, Cristbal Ramn Gmez Lpez, Enrique Jos Arvalo De Oro, Luis Carlos Cerpa Jinete, Carlos Alberto Prado Trujillo and Limberto Antonio Carranza Vanegas; and (iv) the pressure and fear generated among workers belonging to SINALTRAINAL by the latter wave of criminal charges, which obliged the trade union to accept conciliation at a hearing on  July  in order to put an end to the proceedings.\n.The complainant then briefly refers to the criminal charges brought by the company Drummond Limited against workers belonging to SINALTRAINAL for damage allegedly caused by a protest held on  and  June  at the entrance to a mine in the town of El Paso in the Department of Csar.\n.By a communication of  March , the complainant submitted further allegations regarding the abovementioned poultry company. The complainant specifically states that: (i) on  February , a group of SINALTRAINAL members went to the company s premises to ask for a negotiated settlement of the list of demands which the trade union had submitted to the company; (ii) the company, as planned at a meeting held on  January , encouraged non-unionized employees to leave their workstations and to stage a violent counter-protest, even going so far as to form a group of workers wielding clubs and machetes; (iii) Mr Javier Correa Surez, the President of SINALTRAINAL, Mr Juan Carlos Galvis, legal adviser to the trade union s National Executive Board (both of whom benefit from precautionary measures granted by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights) and Mr Nelson Prez Tirado, convenor of the Bucaramanga branch of the trade union, received verbal death threats; (iv) Javier Fernndez Ortiz Franco and Oscar Palomino, company workers belonging to SINALTRAINAL, were physically assaulted; (v) the situation forced SINALTRAINAL members to call the police who managed to rescue Mr Fernndez Ortiz Franco, who had been prevented from leaving the building; (vi) Mr Fernndez Ortiz Franco was hospitalized for more than two weeks in a psychiatric hospital as a result of these events; (vii) SINALTRAINAL lodged a complaint with the Prosecutor s Office on  February , in which it referred to two communications of  November  and  February  requesting the Ombudsperson to issue early warnings in respect of SINALTRAINAL members in the company; and (viii) on  February , representatives of the trade union and the company met the mediator of the Committee for the Handling of Conflicts referred to the ILO (CETCOIT) and agreed to hold a meeting in an attempt to improve worker employer relations, but to date the company has not found a possible date for the meeting. The complainant adds that the abovementioned acts were premeditated by the company s management to goad SINALTRAINAL members, since it had made it clear that it was bent on breaking up the trade union organization by dismissing its members.\n.In a communication of  September , the Government submitted its observations regarding the allegations concerning the transport company in which it forwarded, first, the company s reply stating that: (i) the fact that some company workers have joined SINALTRAINAL results in the existence of two industrial trade unions in the company, the National Union of Freight and Passenger Transport Workers (SINTRACAP) and SINALTRAINAL; (ii) this doubling of trade unions is reflected in the simultaneous membership of some workers in both unions and, above all, in the parallel promotion of two lists of demands; (iii) the parallel existence of two negotiating processes in one company is contrary to the principle of unity of agreement introduced by Decree No.  of ; (iv) the company initiated legal action seeking the setting aside of the revised SINALTRAINAL by-laws and, consequently, to have the company workers' membership of the trade union declared unlawful, since the company does not form part of the food industry; (v) notwithstanding the foregoing, the company did not refuse to discuss the list of demands presented by SINALTRAINAL, as is demonstrated by the agreement signed on  January , which ushered in the direct settlement phase; (vi) a decision of a first instance court of  April , which accepted the company s arguments, found that the transport company workers' membership of SINALTRAINAL was unlawful. The"", "".The complaint is contained in communications dated October , February ,  October ,  May ,  October  and  March .\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  April ,  June  and  July .\n.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In their various communications, the complainant organizations allege that the process of liquidating the company Pricol Alimentos SA (hereinafter  the company'  aimed at destroying the trade union SINTRAPRICOL and eradicating trade union presence in the Facatativ production plant, owned by the Polar corporate group. The complainant organizations particularly emphasize that the liquidation process did not at any point involve consultations with the trade union, that the company dismissed SINTRAPRICOL s leaders without obtaining legal annulment of their trade union immunity and that it applied to nullify the union s legal personality after dismissing the majority of its members. The complainant organizations add that the company and Alimentos Polar Colombia SAS formed a single business entity, and jointly operated the Facatativ production plant, and therefore the process of liquidating the company effectively dissolved the trade union and eradicated union presence in the aforementioned production plant.\n.The complainant organizations go on to detail the sequence of events connected to their allegations. The complainant organizations indicate that: (i) in  the company, part of the Polar corporate group, acquired the assets of Productos Quaker SA, which had begun to operate in the late s in Santiago de Cali; (ii) as a result of this change of ownership, the trade union SINTRAQUAKER, established in , became SINTRAPRICOL; (iii) in , the company s Cali plant had  workers, of whom  were SINTRAPRICOL members, the company and the union having signed, in , a collective agreement which was valid until ; (iv) in November , the company announced that all the workers at the plant would have to relocate, starting from January , to the city of Facatativ (in the department of Cundinamarca); (v) at the same time the company began to put pressure on the workers to accept the termination of their contracts for derisory sums, rather than relocate to Facatativ; (vi) in December , approximately  additional workers joined the trade union; (vii) between  November  and  February  the company terminated  workers' contracts, in violation of the provisions of the collective labour agreement; (viii) on  January  the legal representative of SINTRAPRICOL filed an administrative labour complaint for illegal collective dismissal, which was unsuccessful; (ix) as a result of the abovementioned collective dismissals, the number of unionized workers fell to just ; (x) the company made an application to nullify the union s legal personality, as its membership had fallen below the threshold of  ' the outcome of which is still pending, in view of the reinstatement proceedings that numerous dismissed unionized workers have initiated; (xi) in June  the company s workers, along with workers of other companies in the same sector, established an industry-level trade union, the National Union of Workers in Industry, Farming and Food Processing (SINALTRACINPROA); (xii) in March , SINALTRACINPROA presented the company with a list of demands; (xiii) on  April  negotiations with the company on the set of demands began, causing the circumstantial immunity provided for in Colombian law to come into effect, in favour of all union members; (xiv) on  May , the company and the union not having reached an agreement, the direct settlement stage came to an end and the union requested the Ministry of Health and Social Protection to form an arbitration tribunal; (xv) despite his initial decision, in September , to form an arbitration tribunal, the Deputy Minister of Labour Relations finally back-pedalled following the company s presentation of an administrative appeal; (xvi) on  October  the company s shareholders decided, at their general meeting, to grant voluntarily the dissolution and liquidation of the business that constituted the legal entity under which the company operated; (xvii) under Colombian law, the next steps should have consisted in the company requesting permission from the Ministry of Health and Social Protection for its closure, and seeking authorization from the labour judges to dismiss the workers who were protected by trade union immunity; (xviii) the workers were not informed of the liquidation process, nor of the application to close the company; (xix) in November , the company specially requested the waiver of the trade union immunity of  trade union leaders (Mr Marino Villa Valencia, Mr Jorge Humberto Mayor Jimnez, Mr Ildebrando Zamora Cifuentes, Mr Luis Espper Cuadrado Gutirrez, Mr Diego Rivera Tovar, Mr Abelardo Paz Herrera, Mr Diego Fernndez Flores Loaiza, Mr Jairo Ossa Castillo, Mr Wilson Hernndez Misas, Mr Jorge Heber Morales Cardona, Mr Jos Fernando Snchez Muoz, Mr Eimar Lider Martnez Gmez, Mr Gentil Anbal Muoz and Mr Jorge Alberto Quintero Rodrguez); (xx) on  December , the company decided to dismiss the  unionized workers, who included the  trade union leaders mentioned above and Mr Hctor Fabio Morales Cano, Mr Luis scar Montes, Mr Fernando Lpez Jimnez, Mr Nelson Yesid Castaeda Poloche, Mr Luis Eduardo Abada Basto and Mr Campo Elas Qiroz Asmasa ' despite the fact that at that time the company had not been given either ministerial authorization to close or legal authorization to waive their immunity; (xxi) at the same time, the company s directors continued the process of liquidating the company, without having obtained the permission of the Ministry of Health and Social Protection for its closure; (xxii) when the Ministry requested the company to provide the documentation necessary to process the authorization for closure, the liquidator responded on  January that the company had already been liquidated; (xxiii) on  February  the Ministry of Health and Social Protection withdrew its request to visit the company, which had been sent in January  as part of the closure authorization procedure; (xxiv) on  January  the union presented an administrative labour complaint relating to the  dismissals, based on the fact that the company had violated the legislation on collective dismissals and the trade union immunity that all the workers enjoyed, by virtue of the collective dispute which was still then in progress; (xxv) on  September , the Ministry of Health and Social Protection decided to refrain from imposing any measures at all against the company; (xxvi) the union applied to the Ministry of Health and Social Protection for a declaration stating that the company and Alimentos Polar Colombia SAS were a single business entity, inasmuch as they shared the same corporate aims and jointly operated the Facatativ plant; (xxvii) the union s application was rejected by the Ministry of Health and Social Protection; and (xxviii) the Supervisory Authority for Companies did not take into consideration the statement made by Agencia de Aduanas Agecoldex SA (Agecoldex Customs Agency, SA) indicating that the company failed to make clear, during the process of its dissolution and liquidation, the fact that it belonged to and was dependent on the Polar corporate group, to the serious detriment of its creditors and workers.\n.In their communications of  and , the complainant organizations state that various judicial decisions recognize a violation of trade union immunity to the detriment of the trade union leaders of SINTRAPRICOL and SINALTRACINPROA, but that the judicial authorities refrain from ordering their reinstatement or the payment of indemnities because the company has already been liquidated.\n.With regard to other legal proceedings seeking the reinstatement of workers in Alimentos Polar Colombia SAS, Polmacer Ltda and Inversiones Pricol CA, which continue to operate in the Facatativ plant, the complainant organizations state that various first instance rulings ordered the workers' reinstatement, that these decisions were revoked by second instance rulings and that the outcomes of judicial reviews are now pending.\n.In the same communications, the complainant organizations highlight the fact that the company has continued its productive activities in the Facatativ plant, owned by the Polar corporate group, as Pricol Alimentos SA and Alimentos Polar Colombia SAS are a single business entity. In this connection, the complainant organizations state that: (i) both companies had the same corporate aims; (ii) both companies were owned by the same people; (iii) the two companies identified with the same brand (Polar) ' demonstrated by the fact that both companies' names are on employees' payslips and uniforms; (iv) the company s productive activity in the Facatativ plant was taken over by Alimentos Polar Colombia SAS, with the same machinery being used to produce the same products as before; (v) there is continuity of service: many of the company s workers were transferred to Alimentos Polar Colombia SAS and given positions that reflected their time in the company s service prior to the relocation; and (vi) Alimentos Polar Colombia SAS recognized"", 'of the same year without reaching an agreement; (ix) at the request of the ACDAC, the Ministry of Labour convened an arbitration tribunal, a decision contested by the enterprise but upheld in a ruling of  April ; (x) on  October , the ACDAC, with no explanation, withdrew the list of demands submitted in December ; (xi) on  August , the ACDAC submitted a fresh list of demands without validating the complaint regarding the collective agreement; (xii) the direct settlement stage lasted until  September  with no agreement being reached; (xiii) once the direct settlement stage had ended, the enterprise met with the trade union on more than six occasions with the assistance of the Ministry of Labour; (xiv) the trade union organization elected to unlawfully declare a strike within the enterprise, despite not having obtained the majorities required under the law, and to hold the strike within an essential public service in the strict sense; (xv) on  October , the Special Administrative Unit for Civil Aviation issued a ruling of a general nature and with an erga omnes effect to broaden the opportunities to contract foreign captains in Colombia (the ACDAC lodged an action for protection of rights against the ruling, which was first suspended and later declared to be illegal, which is why the enterprise refrained from contracting foreign captains); (xvi) the enterprise considers that Mr Jaime Hernndez, president of the ACDAC, engaged in conduct that could constitute the offence of economic panic, which is why it consequently filed the related complaint; (xvii) on  October , the Bogota High Court ruled in first instance that the strike held by the ACDAC was illegal on the two grounds mentioned in point (xiv); (xviii) the Ministry of Labour convened the arbitration tribunal when the legal action concerning the classification of the legality of the strike had already been lodged; (xix) the arbitration award was handed down on  December , giving rise to an appeal for annulment that is still pending; (xx) once the strike had ended, the enterprise reinstated the striking workers; (xxi) following the ruling that the strike was illegal and after scrupulously respecting due process, and based on objective and compelling reasons, the enterprise decided with just cause to terminate the employment contracts of  pilots; (xxii) the enterprise considers that the executive board of the ACDAC engaged in behaviour that allegedly amounts to the offence of obstructing the course of justice, which is why it consequently filed the complaint to enable the competent authority to carry out the respective investigation; and (xxiii) although the enterprise reported the possibility of civil proceedings in order to seek compensation for the damage caused, applications of this type have not been brought against any of the members of the ACDAC.\n.The enterprise also comments on the judicial declaration of the illegality of the strike, stating that the declaration complied with the principles of the ILO and recalling that the judicial power to determine the legality or illegality of the strike is set down in a legislative reform of , which was adopted in order to comply with the recommendations of the ILO supervisory bodies in this respect. The enterprise states that the Supreme Court found firstly that, in accordance with the democratic principles recognized by the Political Constitution and by the ILO supervisory bodies, the ACDAC had not obtained the majority required by section  of the Substantive Labour Code to be able to hold a strike. The enterprise indicates in this respect that: (i) without prejudice to the consideration of the ACDAC as an industry- or occupation-based trade union, the democratic principles on strike ballots set down in section  of the Substantive Labour Code should be respected; (ii) the actions of the ACDAC during the strike ballot demonstrate that it recognizes that it is a minority union because, according to the minutes of its meetings, it called on the other trade unions in the enterprise to approve the strike action with the aim of obtaining a majority ballot among all the enterprise s workers; (iii) notwithstanding this, in the end, the ACDAC held the ballot in a members-only meeting room, without the members of the other trade unions casting a ballot, preventing the participation of non-unionized workers despite their request to take part, and without accepting the findings of the labour inspector to guarantee the validity of the results; and (iv) as a result, only  of the enterprise s , workers voted in favour of the strike.\n.The enterprise further states that the Supreme Court, in its examination of the legality of the strike, also considered that, in the Colombian context, air transport constitutes an essential public service because it: (i) ensures the supply of goods and services, thereby guaranteeing fundamental rights such as health and education; (ii) allows the transfer of patients and medical supplies to guarantee the right to life and health of the population; and (iii) even enables humanitarian assistance services to be provided to populations that are remote and disconnected from the national territory and guarantees the connectivity of marginalized or remote regions, which do not have other transport alternatives. The enterprise provides as examples the island of San Andres and the city of Leticia where, owing to the geographical conditions, air transport is the main and almost only means of supplying food and medicines, as well ensuring the movement of people. The enterprise also refers to the declaration of the Governor of the Department of Caldas, cited in the ruling of the Supreme Court, in which he expresses his concern over the consequences of the cessation of activities for the region   remaining completely isolated from the rest of the country  ? In respect of the above, the enterprise provides the following figures: owing to Colombia s economic situation and infrastructure, the enterprise provides  per cent of passenger transport, the provision of  per cent of food supplies to the Department of San Andres, Providencia and Santa Catalina and  per cent of food supplies to the city of Leticia, capital of the Department of Amazonas. It is the only airline authorized for the transport of items such as medicines, human organs, blood, plasma, chemotherapy treatments, human remains and surgical items. The enterprise is the only airline in Colombia that provides air transport to the population of Manizales, Caldas. The  days of strike action affected more than , passengers and , flights were cancelled.\n.The enterprise concludes by highlighting that the review of the enterprise s activity and its classification as an essential public service in the strict sense has been the subject of a detailed legal analysis, followed by a discussion of the evidence in which it was objectively decided that its disruption in Colombia would put the life, personal safety and health of some or all of the population at risk, taking into account the context and transport infrastructure of the country. The enterprise further states that the ruling of the Supreme Court is based on the guidelines developed by the Constitutional Court in its interpretation of article  of the Political Constitution which guarantees the right to strike, except for essential public services defined by the legislator, and that this jurisprudence takes full account of the criteria of the ILO supervisory bodies in this respect. The enterprise adds that, on previous occasions, the Constitutional Court had highlighted the essential nature of the activities of transport companies in general (ruling No. C- of  October ) and of the enterprise that is the subject of this case (ruling No. T- of  November ).\n.The enterprise also states that, in their allegations, the complainant organizations incorrectly refer to previous cases of the Committee on Freedom of Association whose factual elements are very different from this case, which does not allow their use out of context, particularly when taking into account that: (i) the Committee clearly maintains that the existence of a clear and imminent threat to the life, personal safety or health of the whole or part of the population depends to a large extent on the particular circumstances prevailing in a country; (ii) a non-essential service may become essential if a strike lasts beyond a certain time or extends beyond a certain scope, thus endangering life, personal safety or health; and (iii) in this case, the strike held by the ACDAC lasted for  days.\n.The enterprise also provides further details on the disciplinary proceedings brought by the enterprise against the strikers, stating in this respect that: (i) the enterprise respects a process that was previously established with the trade union organization through the collective agreement, which is consistent with the provisions of Colombian legislation; (ii) that process provides for the identification of those workers who took part in the strike, the establishment of their level of participation and thus the imposition of non-discretionary sanctions, in line with the analysis of the level of participation of each pilot, including acquittals in cases where their non-involvement']"

On that occasion, the Committee made the following recommendations:(a)\tCommittee requests the Government to send it the administrative and judicial decisions concerning the enterprise INCA TOPS SA.(b)\tThe Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the appeal brought by the Pisco SAC workers' union, which is currently before the Supreme Court.(c)\tThe Committee, stressing the importance of consultation between enterprises and trade union organizations on labour issues and industrial relations matters of mutual interest and of encouraging and promoting the full development and utilization of machinery for collective bargaining, encourages Romosa SAC and the trade union to negotiate in good faith on all pending demands as soon as the financial situation improves.(d)\tThe Committee requests the Federation of Textile Workers of Peru (FTTP) to provide further detailed information with regard to the allegations that audio-visual equipment is being used for anti-union purposes.(e)\tThe Committee, recalling that fixed-term contracts should not be used deliberately for anti-union purposes and that, in certain circumstances, the employment of workers through repeated renewals of fixed-term contracts for several years can be an obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights, requests the Government to keep it informed of the legislative process regarding the draft legislation for the repeal of sections ,  and  of the Act on the promotion of non-traditional exports and section  of Legislative Decree No. .\n.In communications dated  September ,  June ,  August ,  October ,  November  and  March , the Government provided the following information in response to these recommendations.\n.As regards recommendation (a), the Government reports that: (i) in a judgment issued in , the seventh specialized civil court ruled in favour of Mr Lpez Motta with respect to the amparo [protection of constitutional rights] appeal that he had lodged; and (ii) Mr Lpez Motta was reinstated in his post on  October .\n.As regards recommendation (b), the Government reports that the Supreme Court of Justice of the Republic upheld the judgment issued by the Superior Court of Justice of Ica, which had declared the claim filed by the enterprise contesting the administrative resolutions to be well-founded.\n.With respect to recommendation (c), the Government indicates that, on  September , the enterprise and the trade union signed a collective agreement that resolved the lists of demands dated ' , '  and ' . The Government also indicates that the parties signed two more collective agreements on  July  and  December .\n.With respect to recommendation (d), the Government indicates that, in , the National Labour Inspection Authority issued two fines to the enterprise for violations of freedom of association. The Government has also resubmitted to the Committee a copy of a document dated  October  that it had received from the FTTP, which contains information relating to the present case. In this document, the FTTP indicates that: (i) the use of audio-visual equipment has been expanded in all production areas within the enterprise, in particular the areas where union leaders and members work; (ii) the enterprise has deployed security staff who continually record the work of unionized workers with the cameras on their mobile telephones, which leads to these workers being summoned to the human resources department for trivial reasons and then often punished; and (iii) this does not occur with non-unionized workers.\n.As regards recommendation (e), the Government reports that Bill No. , which proposes the repeal of sections ,  and  of the Act on the promotion of non-traditional exports and section  of Legislative Decree No. , is currently before the Labour and Social Security Commission and the Foreign Trade and Tourism Commission.\n.The complaint in Case No.  is contained in communications dated  March and  June  from the Federation of Textile Workers of Peru (FTTP). The Government sent its observations in communications of  June,  July,  August and  September .\n.The complaint in Case No. , which concerns only one of the allegations in the Case No.  complaint, is contained in a communication dated  March  from the Confederation of Workers of Peru (CTP). The Government sent its observations in a communication of  July .\n.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In the communications of  March and  June  from the FTTP (Case No. ) and the communication of  March  from the CTP (Case No. ), the complainants allege that various enterprises in the textile sector have engaged in anti-union practices.\n.Both complainants allege that the enterprise INCA TOPS SA refused to grant trade union leave to and dismissed without just cause Mr Jos Abel Lpez Motta, General Secretary of the Southern Federation of Textile Workers (FERETTEX SUR) and, until December , General Secretary of the INCA TOPS SA Union and Solidarity trade union. They maintain that the dismissal of Mr Lpez Motta, allegedly for  days of unexcused absence over a period of  working days, was a form of punishment for his success as a union leader. The dismissal letter sent to Mr Lpez Motta claimed that he had used trade union leave to which he was not entitled, having requested it as the leader of FERETTEX SUR, a higher-level trade union that had not signed a collective agreement granting trade union leave to its leaders. However, Mr Lpez Motta had requested trade union leave in accordance with the Collective Labour Relations Act, section  of which states that the legislation applicable to trade unions, including  days of trade union leave per year, also applies to federations and confederations. The complainants report that the labour inspectorate penalized the enterprise for refusing to grant Mr Lpez Motta trade union leave because, in its view, the enterprise had not taken into account the fact that:' the higher-level trade union is made up of lower-level trade unions. Thus, by participating in the former s activities, they are safeguarding the latter s interests. For this reason, it is reasonable for trade union leave to be granted as applicable; otherwise, the higher-level unions ' would never be able to perform their functions unless the collective agreement in force authorized the granting of trade union leave for specific higher-level activities\n.The FTTP also alleges that the textile factory Pisco SAC refused to grant trade union leave to Mr Francisco Juvencio Luna Acevedo, leader of the factory s trade union and FTTP defence secretary and Regional Secretary for the southern region. The complainant federation also alleges that the enterprise failed to comply with administrative decisions ordering an across-the-board increase of PEN. in the daily wage, issued in  as the result of a strike.\n.The FTTP further alleges that the manufacturing enterprise Romosa SAC engages in anti-union practices, including by harassing and discriminating against workers who perform trade union functions through wage cuts, requiring that their communications be made through a notary, installing audio-visual equipment only in the parts of the facility that are occupied by union members and changing working hours and shifts (the federation attaches a copy of labour inspectorate infraction notice No. -, which states that the enterprise has committed a very serious offence by failing to inform the trade union organization of a change in working hours). In addition, the FTTP maintains that the enterprise refused to negotiate wage increases, introduce job improvements or appoint an arbitrator (the federation attaches a copy of the Ministry of Labour directorate order No.   MTPE//. of  March , stating that the enterprise s refusal to deal with the list of demands for the period '  was groundless and requesting it to convene the negotiating committee).\n.The FTTP alleges that the enterprise Tecnologa Textil SA engages in anti-union practices. It ignores or fails to implement some provisions of the collective agreement that has been signed and fails to pay the textile bonus. It requires unionized workers to work in a separate area, sets up special shifts for them and places audio-visual equipment in their workplace; places restrictions on the breaks that they have traditionally been allowed to take; limits or denies them established allowances, customs and traditions; discriminates against them with regard to treatment and wages by differentiating between unionized and non-unionized workers. The complainant federation alleges that, in order to destabilize, disrupt and eliminate the trade union organization, the enterprise imposes restrictions, uses blackmail and offers advantages and benefits to workers who agree to withdraw from the trade union. It attaches documents rejecting requests for trade union leave and a request by the enterprise s trade union that the labour inspectorate consider this rejection as an obstruction of trade union activities.\n.With regard to legislation, the complainant"", ""federation submits additional complaints concerning Peruvian law. The FTTP calls for the repeal of sections ,  and  of the Act on the promotion of non-traditional exports and section  of Legislative Decree No. , which authorizes the hiring of temporary workers in unlimited numbers and for unlimited time periods, undermining thousands of textile workers' right to job security and thus limiting their ability to unionize and exercise their right to bargain collectively.\n.Lastly, the FTTP mentions alleged labour law violations that are unrelated to the exercise of trade union rights.\n.In its communications of  and  July and  September , the Government sent comments by and information from the relevant enterprises (summarized below) and requested that the cases be declared closed.\n.Concerning the allegation that Mr Lpez Motta s dismissal for unauthorized use of trade union leave constituted anti-union bias, the enterprise INCA TOPS SA states that the dismissal was duly substantiated and carried out in accordance with the regulations applicable to serious misconduct:  days of unexcused absence over a -day period. The enterprise notes that the default leave provisions contained in section  of the Collective Labour Relations Act apply only in the absence of an agreement. In that connection, it states that the agreement provides for the granting of  days of paid trade union leave to the general, defence and organization secretaries of its three trade unions. It maintains that it granted the trade union leave that Mr Lpez Motta requested in his capacity as General Secretary of the Union and Solidarity trade union, one of the enterprise s three trade unions. However, the leave requests that he submitted in his capacity as General Secretary of FERETTEX and his request for  days of additional leave per year to take care of the federation s business were denied because the enterprise considered that the agreements made no provision for such leave. Despite having been denied leave, Mr Lpez Motta missed work and was therefore dismissed for serious misconduct, as is established in and penalized under the labour laws. The enterprise emphasizes that, having been denied leave, Mr Lpez Motta could have used a portion of the  days of annual leave to which he was entitled under an agreement in his capacity as General Secretary of the Union and Solidarity trade union. The Government observes that the enterprise has appealed against subdirectorate Decision No. --GRA/GRTPE-DPSC-SDILSST, under which a fine was imposed for refusal to grant leave, and that this appeal is pending before the Directorate for Dispute Prevention and Resolution in the Arequipa Ministry of Labour. The Government also reports that Mr Lpez Motta has brought an amparo (protection of constitutional rights) appeal against his dismissal. The Government therefore concludes that both parties are exercising their rights and that it will be for the courts to determine whether there was a just cause for dismissal.\n.With regard to the allegation that the textile factory Pisco SAC refused to grant trade union leave, the enterprise notes that the current agreement provides for granting of the trade union leave envisaged in the Collective Labour Relations Act and states that it has granted such leave in accordance with domestic law. This was confirmed by the labour inspectorate in its report on inspection activities (inspection order No. --JZ-PIS) of  September , which states that the enterprise received requests for trade union leave from Mr Luna Acevedo and granted them, making no mention of the violation alleged by the FTTP. Concerning the administrative decisions issued in  as the result of a strike, the Government provides detailed information on the judicial proceedings that led to the repeal of these decisions and states that the enterprise s union has brought an appeal against their repeal, which is currently pending before the Supreme Court.\n.In response to the allegation that the manufacturing enterprise Romosa SAC engages in anti-union practices targeting unionized workers, the enterprise states, with regard to the alleged wage cuts, that the remuneration of unionized workers was decreased at the express request of the trade union s members, who wished to work only eight hours per day and not to be asked to work overtime. The enterprise also states that the majority of the workers (, including two trade union members) were in favour of the change in working hours;  workers, all of them members of the union, opposed it. The enterprise maintains that communication through a notary was not, in principle, required; it felt compelled to adopt that practice because many union members refused to accept communications. Concerning a case that had been documented by the FTTP as an example of harassment of a trade union member, the enterprise stated that, as a penalty, the worker in question had been sanctioned with one day without pay after being found reading a newspaper during working hours rather than carrying out the assigned tasks. With respect to the refusal to increase wages and introduce job improvements pursuant to two lists of as-yet-unresolved union demands and to appoint an arbitrator for optional arbitration, the enterprise states that the Ministry of Labour itself had ordered the issuance of economic and financial directives on the enterprise s situation, which stated that the enterprise had been suffering losses that made it impossible for it to increase wages.\n.Concerning the allegation that the enterprise Tecnologa Textil SA engages in anti-union practices by discriminating against unionized workers, failing to implement the agreement and refusing to grant trade union leave, the enterprise states that on  January , after months of negotiations with the trade union, an agreement providing for immediate and substantive economic improvements was reached. It also states that the textile bonus established in the collective agreement has been paid, as confirmed by the labour inspectorate (subdirectorate Decision No. --MTPE//., which, to the enterprise s knowledge, has not been called into question by the complainant federation). According to the enterprise, its premises are undivided and there are no special shifts, restrictions on breaks or similar situations, nor has the labour inspectorate mentioned anything of the kind during its visits. With respect to the alleged refusal to grant trade union leave, the enterprise states that union representatives are granted leave as established in the Collective Labour Relations Act and its implementing regulations and recalls that, according to section  of the Act,  ...employers shall only be required to grant leave for events at which attendance is compulsory'  It goes on to state that, where leave has been denied, it was because the trade union had failed to identify and substantiate the events at which its representatives' attendance was compulsory and that the labour inspectorate has yet to comment on any of the union s requests for verification.\n.With respect to the FTTP allegations calling for repeal of sections ,  and  of the Act on the promotion of non-traditional exports and section  of Legislative Decree No. , the Government, in its communication of  June , reports that the draft legislation for the repeal of those provisions is currently before Congress pending the issuance of an opinion by the Labour and Social Security Committee. The Government states that, as the issue is a complex one, it is being examined in greater depth and opinions and technical reports have been requested from the relevant institutions. At the current stage, information is being gathered with a view to preparation of a preliminary opinion for discussion by the Labour and Social Security Committee. Concerning the federation s legislative allegations, in its communication of  August , the Government states that the legislative instruments in question raise no issues of compatibility with the ILO Conventions on freedom of association that have been ratified by Peru.\n.Concerning the alleged anti-union dismissal of Mr Lpez Motta for unauthorized use of trade union leave, the Committee notes that, according to the enterprise INCA TOPS SA, the dismissal was substantiated in accordance with the current legislation governing unauthorized absences and that the representatives of higher-level trade union organizations are not entitled to trade union leave because it is not envisaged in the trade unions' agreements with the enterprise. The Committee observes that, according to the enterprise, when his request for trade union leave was denied, Mr Lpez Motta could have used a portion of the  days of annual leave to which he was entitled under an agreement in his capacity as General Secretary of one of the enterprise s trade unions. It also observes that, according to section  of the Collective Labour Relations Act, in the absence of an agreement, additional leave is  considered leave without pay or other benefits'  The Committee notes that the labour inspectorate fined the enterprise for refusing to grant trade union leave.

The UDA indicates that, together with its members, it organized and carried out industrial action from March  in the search for a reformulation of salaries, among other labour claims, since the Government refused to reopen collective bargaining, namely to convene the federal joint negotiation board, and so the fixing of salaries remained in the hands of the State, against a background of  per cent year-on-year inflation. The industrial action, which was lawful and had been notified to the labour authority, received voluntary mass support from teachers in Argentina, who withdrew from their duties. The complainant alleges that, in addition to the failure to convene the joint negotiation board, the State decided to reduce the share of the Compensation Fund (financed by the Government) received by the seven provinces facing the greatest difficulties. According to official announcements, the intention of the Ministry of Education is to reduce that share by  per cent per year, until it disappears altogether in . As regards the Education Incentive Fund (FONID), the UDA states that even though it had been instituted for salary emergencies? it has become a normal and usual complement to teachers?salaries, albeit with the downside that it is not classified as remuneration and hence does not generate social security contributions.\n.Considering the salary situation in the Province of Buenos Aires to be unsustainable, the complainant indicates that it filed an action for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) at the end of March . As a protective measure, it requested the convening of the negotiation board provided for under section  of the Education Finance Act (No. ), with implementing regulations laid down by Decree No. /. By a decision of  April , the protective measure was granted in summary proceedings and the Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security was ordered to convene within five days the negotiation board provided for by section  of Act No. . The State appealed against this decision in the National Chamber for Labour Appeals. The proceedings are in progress and no first-instance ruling had been issued by the end of May .\n.The UDA adds that on  March  the Government summoned the trade unions to a joint meeting during which it made a proposal consisting of the advance payment of one-off fixed sums not classified as remuneration (considered illegal and not generating contributions to the social security system) for serving employees, the payment being subject to non-implementation of the industrial action called for by the trade unions at the national level for  and  March . As the proposal was rejected, the Ministry of Labour of the Province of Buenos Aires did not put forward any other proposal but served notice of compulsory conciliation on the trade unions. The unions had recourse to the local court for administrative disputes and on  March  secured a ruling consisting of a protective measure. The ruling stated that if no agreement was reached between the parties, the dispute would be settled by a provisional impartial body set up by joint agreement for the sole purpose of settling the joint negotiations. This decision was then overturned by the appeals chamber for administrative disputes in La Plata. On  March , the court for administrative disputes, at a request from the unions, issued a new protective measure: (i) ordering the Executive Authority to refrain from implementing any act that disrupted, restricted, limited or affected the freedom of workers and their organizations in collective negotiations; and (ii) ordering the Ministry of Labour to take the necessary steps to ensure that collective bargaining goes ahead in an environment of good faith, freedom and equality between the parties.\n.The complainant also reports threats made by a number of officials in the Province of Buenos Aires (involving fines, declarations of illegality, revocation of trade union status, monetary deductions, etc.).

The Committee notes that the Government indicates in particular that: (i) by means of resolution No.  of , the Threats Group has been established within the Specialized Directorate against Human Rights Violations that currently has ten public prosecutors responsible for supporting the Sectional Directorates where threats against the target population of this strategy are being made; and (ii) the Public Prosecutor s Office has developed a specific strategy and designated a specialist public prosecutor from the National Working Group on Threats to investigate threats against trade unionists in the mining and energy sector in Valle del Cauca as a matter of priority\n.The Committee takes due note of the information provided by the Government and welcomes in particular the continuation and strengthening of efforts to guarantee that the investigation and resolution of all acts of anti-union violence and the punishment of the perpetrators constitutes a State priority carried out by methods appropriate for the types of crimes in question and through broad inter-institutional coordination. The Committee also takes note of the progress reported in the investigations of the specific acts of anti-union violence reported in the framework of this case and the homicides reported by the Prosecutor General s Office in . At the same time, the Committee again notes the lack of information about the investigation and punishment of the potential instigators of those crimes. The Committee once again emphasizes in this regard that the investigations should focus not only on the individual perpetrator of the crime but also its instigators, with the aim of ensuring that justice is fully done and significantly preventing future acts of violence against trade union members. While welcoming the significant action taken by the competent authorities, the Committee urges the Government to continue strengthening its efforts to ensure that all the acts of anti-union violence, homicides, threats and other acts reported in the country are cleared up and that the perpetrators and instigators are convicted. The Committee particularly hopes that all further steps will be taken and all necessary resources committed in order to ensure that the investigations and criminal procedures relating to the acts of anti-union violence reported in this case are made significantly more effective in identifying and punishing the instigators. The Committee once again requests the Government to provide detailed information in this regard.\n.Concerning the steps taken by the public authorities to prevent acts of anti-union violence and protect trade union members at risk, the Committee takes note, first, of the quantitative data provided by the Government, which indicates that: (i)  members of the trade union movement were protected in  (of which  with strict protection measures) and, with data available up to  November ,  members of the trade union movement received protection in  (of which  with strict protection measures); and (ii) the UNP had a budget of ,,,,. Colombian pesos in  (approximately US$ million), compared to ,,,. pesos in . The Committee also notes that the Government states that: (i) in the framework of the Timely Action Plan (PAO) for individual and collective prevention and protection of the rights to life, liberty, integrity and security for human rights defenders, social and community leaders and journalists, the PAO Operating Committee for protection and immediate response to infringements of the rights to life, integrity, liberty and security has been established, and that, in that framework, there are  priority municipalities for operations, with proposals to add a further  municipalities; (ii) there have been collective risk assessments for six  population groups with accredited status as trade union leaders or activists' (four risk assessments have been finalized and two are active); and (iii) the Ministry of Labour continues to lead the Technical Secretariat of the Inter-Institutional Committee for the Promotion and Protection of Workers' Human Rights, which held three sessions in , one of which had a focus on difficulties faced by working women and gender issues.\n.The Committee commends the significant efforts of the competent authorities to protect against anti-union violence. The Committee takes particular note in this regard of the significant increase in the budget of the UNP and the regular consultations held with the social partners in the Inter-Institutional Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Workers' Human Rights. At the same time, the Committee takes note with deep concern of the  homicides of trade unionists reported by the Government in , events that indicate the persistence of a serious situation of anti-union violence in the country. The Committee recalls in this regard that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed [see Compilation of decisions of the Freedom of Association Committee, sixth edition , para. ]. In these circumstances, the Committee urges the Government to continue strengthening its efforts to afford adequate protection to members of the trade union movement exposed to risk. With a view to ensuring that the policies to prevent anti-union violence achieve greater impact, the Committee particularly urges the Government to: (i) in the framework of the institutional initiatives and forums for the protection of human rights defenders and social leaders, continue to give the necessary attention to the specific situation of members of the trade union movement at risk; and (ii) provide updated information about the measures taken to prevent acts of anti-union violence in the main risk areas at the regional and sectoral level, which the Government brought to the attention of the Committee at its previous examination of the case (see rd Report, para. ). The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n.With regard to the wounds suffered in  by Mr Oscar Arturo Orozco, member of the SINTRAELECOL union, the Committee takes note that the Government: (i) recalls that it had noted that the investigation into the crime of wounding was progressing at the Caldas Sectional Directorate; and (ii) states that, according to the Public Prosecutor s Office, the public prosecutor in the case issued a decision to close the case. With regard to the threats reported in  by Mr Oscar Lema Vega, the Committee notes that the Government states that the investigation was provisionally closed as a result of the inability to identify or establish an active suspect.\n.With regard to the facts reported by the Union of Cali Municipal Enterprise Workers (SINTRAEMCALI) the Committee notes that the Government reiterates that the Public Prosecutor s Office began an investigation into the events leading to the arson against the motor vehicle belonging to Mr Jos Ernesto Reyes; on the basis of these events it was decided to close the proceedings as no active suspect for the crime could be identified or singled out. The Government emphasizes in this regard that, with cases that are closed as a result of the inability to identify or establish an active suspect, once new information or conducive, pertinent and useful evidence is obtained, the case can be reopened and proceedings resumed.\n.The Committee notes with regret the lack of identification and punishment for the perpetrators of these serious crimes. The Committee recalls that, in cases of physical or verbal violence against workers' and employers' leaders and their organizations, the Committee has emphasized that the absence of judgments against the guilty parties creates, in practice, a situation of impunity, which reinforces the climate of violence and insecurity, and which is extremely damaging to the exercise of trade union rights [see Compilation, para. ].\n.The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of any new information that permits the reopening of the aforementioned investigations and to ensure that any new potential risk for members and leaders of the two organizations gives rise to an immediate response from the competent authorities.\n.In connection with the reported murders of  UTP members, including  union leaders, between  June  and  October , and the attempted homicide of another UTP leader on"", ""recalls that: (i) the allegations of anti-union violence presented by those organizations in Cases Nos  and  refer to specific acts of anti-union violence (in respect of SINTRAELECOL the wounds suffered in  by Mr Oscar Arturo Orozco and the death threats to which Mr Oscar Lema Vega was subjected and, in respect of SINTRAEMCALI, the attack of April  on the headquarters of the organization and the vehicle of one of its leaders); and (ii) in its previous examination of these cases, the Committee expressed the strong hope that the investigations and proceedings under way would lead to a speedy determination of the facts and the conviction of the perpetrators and instigators, and requested the Government to keep it informed in that regard. Based on the foregoing, the Committee again requests the Government to inform it of the progress of the investigations and proceedings under way in connection with the specific events reported in  by SINTRAELECOL and SINTRAEMCALI.\n.In connection with the reported murders of  UTP members, including three union leaders, between  June  and  October  and the attempted homicide of another UTP leader on  June , the Committee notes the general information provided by the Government on the situation as of  January  and on all the investigations relating to cases of violence against UTP members and leaders, and its report of the existence of  investigations in this regard ( involving homicide and one threats). The Committee notes the information from the Government that, in this connection: (i)  cases are at the sentencing stage, with  convictions handed down to  persons; and (ii) a further  cases are active (four at the trial stage, six at the pre-trial or investigation stage and  at the preliminary or enquiry stage).\n.The Committee takes due note of this information, in particular the handing down of  convictions. The Committee observes at the same time that it has no information on the motives behind the homicides for which convictions were handed down, or on whether the convicted persons were both instigators and perpetrators of the acts and whether the sentencing process identified any links between the individual murders of UTP members. The Committee therefore urges the Government to continue making all necessary efforts to ensure that all the homicides and the attempted homicide of UTP leaders and members reported in this case are cleared up and that the perpetrators and instigators are convicted. The Committee also requests the Government, in relation to the incidents reported in this case, to provide detailed information on the progress of the investigations underway and on the content of the sentences handed down.\n.Concerning the alleged homicide of the UTP members, Messrs Diego Rodrguez Gonzlez and Manuel Alfonso, the Committee notes that the Government states that the Public Prosecutor s Office, having checked its information systems, was unable to fully identify the persons in question and requests that it be sent their national identity card numbers so that they can be identified with certainty. Based on the above, the Committee invites the UTP and the Government to come into contact and complete the identification process.\n.Concerning the alleged death threats made against various UTP leaders and the corresponding protective measures taken by the UNP, the Committee notes the information provided by the Government in respect of Messrs Julio Csar Garca Salazar, Eleasid Durn Snchez, Jhony Javier Pabn Martnez and Franklin Excenover Gmez Surez. The Committee also notes that the Government states that, for Ms Cindy Yuliana Rodrguez Layos, identity card numbers are needed in order to rule out namesakes. The Committee further notes that: (i) the Government has not provided the requested information on the risk status of Mr Mauricio Paz Jojoa, and (ii) the complainant organization has not provided the requested information on Messrs Roberto Carlos Correa Aparicio, Gerson Mndez, Carlos Fabin Velazco Virama, Rafael Gmez Meja, Helkin Duarte Cristancho, scar Tulio Rodrguez Mesa and Mauricio Olarte Mahecha (for all of whom the UNP states that it has not received any request for protective measures). In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to provide the requested information concerning the risk assessment for Mr Mauricio Paz Jojoa. The Committee also invites the UTP and the Government to come into contact to complete the definitive identification of Ms Cindy Yuliana Rodrguez Layos.\n.Observing finally that the Government, in connection with the UTP members, reports one case of threats under investigation, whereas, in its initial complaint, the UTP cites  members and leaders as having been subjected to death threats, the Committee requests the Government to ascertain that all the allegations of threats against UTP members or leaders have led to investigations intended to identify and punish the perpetrators.\n.The Committee notes the allegations presented by the Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CTC) in a communication dated  June  concerning an attack on Mr Gustavo Adolfo Aguilar, President of SINTRASERPUVAL, on  March . The Committee notes that the complainant organization states that Mr Aguilar was attacked by assailants whose weapon failed to fire and that the victim, prior to the attack, had reported violations of labour rights by the municipal council in Riofro (Valle del Cauca). The Committee recalls, in this regard, that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental rights, and in particular those relating to human life and personal safety, are fully respected and guaranteed, that the exercise of trade union rights is incompatible with violence or threats of any kind and that it is for the authorities to investigate without delay and, if necessary, penalize any act of this kind [see Compilation, paras  and ]. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take all necessary steps to afford protection to Mr Aguilar and to ensure that the necessary investigations are carried out to promptly identify and punish the perpetrators and instigators of the attack which took place in March . The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a) While welcoming the significant efforts made by the public authorities and the growing number of sentences handed down, the Committee, given the scale of the challenges which face the country in dealing with anti-union violence and impunity, urges the Government to further strengthen its efforts to ensure that all acts of anti-union violence, homicides, threats and other acts reported in the country are cleared up and that the perpetrators and instigators are convicted. The Committee particularly hopes that all further steps will be taken and all necessary resources committed in order to ensure that the investigations and criminal proceedings conducted in connection with the acts of anti-union violence reported in this case are made significantly more effective in identifying and punishing the instigators. The Committee requests the Government to provide detailed information in this respect.(b) While welcoming the significant efforts made by the public authorities in this regard, and the consultations held with the social partners within the framework of the Inter-Institutional Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Workers' Human Rights, the Committee urges the Government to continue strengthening its efforts to afford adequate protection to all trade union leaders and members at risk. With a view to increasing the impact of the policies for preventing anti-union violence, the Committee especially requests the Government to continue encouraging, in the framework of the Timely Action Plan and the Inter-Institutional Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Workers' Human Rights as well as the appropriate tripartite forums, close dialogue between the trade unions and the various competent authorities. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.(c) The Committee again requests the Government to inform it of the progress of the ongoing investigations and proceedings concerning the specific events reported in  by the Union of Energy Workers of Colombia (SINTRAELECOL) and the Union of Cali Municipal Enterprise Workers (SINTRAEMCALI).(d) The Committee urges the Government to continue making all necessary efforts to ensure that all the homicides and the attempted homicide of UTP leaders and members reported in this case are cleared up and that the perpetrators and instigators are convicted. The Committee also requests the Government, in connection with the incidents reported in this case, to provide detailed information on the progress of the ongoing investigations and on the content of the sentences handed down. The Committee also invites the UTP and the Government to come into contact to complete the identification of Messrs Diego Rodrguez Gonzlez and Manuel Alfonso.(e) The Committee requests the Government to provide the requested information concerning the risk status of Mr Mauricio Paz Jojoa. The Committee also invites the Single Trade Union Association of Public Employees in the Colombian Prison System (UTP) and the Government to come into contact concerning the definitive identification of Ms Cindy Yuliana Rodrguez Layos. The Committee further requests the Government to ascertain that all the threats against UTP"", ""anti-union violence, murders and other acts reported in the country are cleared up and that the perpetrators and instigators are convicted;(b)\tThe Committee requests the Government to inform it of the impact exerted by the special summary criminal procedure established under Act No.  on the investigations into acts of anti-union violence;(c)\tThe Committee requests the Government to continue providing information concerning, in general, the consultation of the social partners in the framework of investigation procedures relating to acts of anti-union violence and in particular relating to the functioning of the Inter-Institutional Commission for the Promotion and Protection of Workers' Human Rights;(d)\tThe Committee takes due note of the information provided in respect of  cases of murder and  acts of anti-union violence and requests the Government to continue providing information in this regard;(e)\tThe Committee again requests the Government to inform it of any examination of a case of anti-union violence by the bodies created as part of the peace process;(f)\tWhile taking due note of the significant efforts made in this regard, the Committee urges the Government to continue strengthening its efforts to afford adequate protection to all union leaders and members at risk. The Committee especially requests the Government: (i) in the framework of the Timely Action Plan (PAO) to give its full attention to protecting trade unionists and to ensuring that the trade unions and the Ministry of Labour are effectively involved in this mechanism, and (ii) in the framework of the PAO and the appropriate tripartite forums, to identify, in close consultation with the social partners, the main causes of anti-union violence so that policies to prevent anti-union violence can achieve greater impact. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard;(g)\tThe Committee expresses the strong hope that the investigations and procedures still under way will lead to the speedy resolution of the allegations made by the Union of Energy Workers of Colombia (SINTRAELECOL) and the Union of Cali Municipal Enterprise Workers (SINTRAEMCALI), and to the conviction of the perpetrators and instigators. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard;(h)\tThe Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the Public Prosecutor s Office conducts the necessary investigations as soon as possible to ensure that all the murders and the attempted murder of leaders and members of the Single Trade Union Association of Public Employees in the Colombian Prison System (UTP) reported in this case are cleared up and that the perpetrators and instigators are convicted. In this regard, the Committee especially urges that the planning and implementation of the investigations: (i) give full and systematic consideration to possible links between the murders and the victims' trade union activities, including any complaints of acts of corruption that they may have lodged; (ii) examine possible links between separately reported murders, and (iii) establish the necessary contacts with the trade union to gather all available information;(i)\tThe Committee requests the Government to provide information on the alleged murder of the UTP member, Mr Diego Rodrguez Gonzlez, and also requests the UTP to provide details of the alleged murder of Mr Manuel Alfonso;(j)\tThe Committee urges the Government to take steps to ensure that the risk status of the UTP leaders, Messrs Eleasid Durn Snchez, Cindy Yuliana Rodrguez Layos, Franklin Excenover Gmez Surez, Jhony Javier Pabn Martnez and Mauricio Paz Jojoa is assessed immediately and that they are afforded the necessary protection as soon as possible;(k)\tThe Committee invites the UTP to contact the competent authorities in order to clarify the situation of the union leaders, Messrs Julio Csar Garca Salazar, Roberto Carlos Correa Aparicio, Gerson Mndez, Carlos Fabin Velazco Virama, Rafael Gmez Meja, Helkin Duarte Cristancho, scar Tulio Rodrguez Mesa and Mauricio Olarte Mahecha; and(l)\tThe Committee draws the particular attention of the Governing Body to the extreme seriousness and urgency of this case.\n.In a communication dated  June , the CTC reported that on  March  an attempt was made on the life of Mr Gustavo Adolfo Aguilar, President of the Union of Public Officials and Employees in the Government and Municipalities of Colombia (SINTRASERPUVAL). The complainant organization states in this regard that: (i) Mr Aguilar was attacked by several individuals while riding his motorcycle on the highway; (ii) one of the attackers activated a weapon which failed to fire and the victim managed to escape and place himself under police protection; and (iii) prior to the attack, Mr Aguilar had reported violations of labour agreements and other administrative irregularities in the town of Riofro (Valle del Cauca).\n.In a communication of February , the Government reiterates its emphatic rejection of all acts of violence, whatever the source, and states its intention to move forward with the investigations to clarify the facts and to protect workers, in particular union leaders. It states that every State institution charged with the defence of human rights has made considerable efforts to protect the life and integrity of Colombia s inhabitants, especially social leaders, including trade unionists.\n.The Government states that Objective  of the National Development Plan for '  provides for the development and implementation of a national government policy of prevention and protection concerned with social and community leaders, journalists and human rights defenders, and that, in accordance with this commitment, on  December  the President of the Republic presented guidelines on a comprehensive government policy to uphold and safeguard the work of defending human rights. The Government points out that the development of this policy paid particular attention to an intersectoral approach to State action and to the concentration of violence against social leaders found in rural areas. The Government also states that the Public Prosecutor s Office is maintaining its strategy of investigating and prosecuting offences against trade unionists, through the prioritization and follow-up of such cases by the elite group formed for this purpose in .\n.In a communication dated  February , the Government states that the impunity gap with respect to anti-union violence has been broken, as more than  court convictions have been handed down and the number of homicides of trade unionists in the country has been drastically reduced since . The Government indicates in this regard that: (i) from the year  to the year  the reduction in the number of cases of homicides of trade unionists was  per cent, from  cases in the year  to  cases during the year ; (ii)  cases of homicides of trade unionists were recorded in ,  in ,  in  and, to date, one in ; and (iii) the number of homicides of trade unionists has, therefore, decreased significantly and it is important to make a distinction in this regard between social leaders and trade union leaders which are two distinct categories, although in some cases the same person may have this dual status.\n.In its different communications, the Government provides detailed information on the results of the investigations and criminal proceedings relating to cases of anti-union violence. Some of these data have also been updated in communications of October and November  addressed to the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR) and containing material relating specifically to Case No. .\n.The Government refers first to the  cases of anti-union violence ( of them involving homicides) reported in that case, stating that it has made significant progress in  cases, to the extent that: (i)  cases have already resulted in convictions (a total of  sentences handed down); (ii) one case is at the trial stage; (iii) one case is at the enquiry stage with an arrest warrant issued; and (iv) two cases under investigation are showing significant progress. The Government adds that the above-mentioned investigations have been linked to  persons, of whom  have been deprived of their liberty. In its  communications, the Government also refers to the number of homicides of union leaders () investigated by the Public Prosecutor s Office between  and . The Government states that . per cent of those investigations have been cleared up: (i)  cases have already led to convictions (a total of  sentences handed down); (ii) cases are at the trial stage; (iii) charges have been brought in ten cases; (iv) six cases are at the enquiry stage with arrest warrants issued; and (v) two cases have been closed. The Government emphasizes that this clear-up rate is far higher than that for homicides in general ( per cent). The Government states finally that: (i) a total of  sentences have been handed down for homicides of trade union members, an increase of  sentences with respect to its previous report; (ii) a total of  court convictions have been handed down for crimes against trade unionists, with the decongestion courts having handed down  such judgments during ; and (iii) as of  January , of the  homicides of trade unionists registered in , three were already at the trial stage while the other , as well""]"

The complaint in Case No.  is contained in a communication from the Indigenous and Rural Workers' Trade Union Movement of Guatemala (MSICG) dated  May . As the complainant organization is the same and as both complaints primarily concern legislative matters, the Committee decided to examine Cases Nos  and  together.\n.The Government sent its observations in communications of  August, September and  November ;  May,  July,  August and  December ;  January,  and  September  and  January .\n.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.At its June  meeting, the Committee made the following recommendations in relation to Case No.  [see nd Report, para. ]:\n.In its communication of  May , the complainant organization denounces the ineffectiveness of the legislative and judicial protection provided to trade union officials in respect of anti-union discrimination. The complainant organization states that, although the Political Constitution and the Labour Code provide protection against anti-union dismissal in the form of reinstatement to workers who: (i) are involved in a socio-economic collective dispute (section  of the Labour Code); (ii) have participated or are participating in the establishment of a trade union (section  of the Labour Code); or (iii) are members of the executive committee (section (d) of the Labour Code), these workers are deprived, because of legislative and judicial shortcomings, of a means of prompt and effective protection.\n.The complainant organization alleges in particular that: (i) although the Labour Code provides that orders for the reinstatement of workers who are victims of anti-union dismissal must be issued and applied within  hours of the complaint being submitted to the court, the Code omits any express regulation on how the process of reinstatement should take place; and (ii) in view of this omission, the labour courts, under section  of the Code of Civil and Commercial Procedure, consider applications for reinstatement in ordinary proceedings. The complainant organization further denounces the fact that the labour courts require that all remedies, exceptions and questions of procedure must be exhausted in order to issue a reinstatement order, which causes excessive delays. The complainant organization states that a reinstatement procedure for a trade union official can involve up to three hearings and that a reinstatement order can be issued only after the decision is final, in other words, after it has been upheld by the Court of Appeal, which, in practice, can take more than ten years. Under these circumstances, the complainant organization claims that the Government of Guatemala, by failing to provide effective protection to the trade union leaders responsible for representing and liaising on behalf of the unions, is not guaranteeing adequate protection against anti-union dismissal.\n.In a communication of  May , the Government provides its observations in respect of the legislative provisions which, according to the complainant organization, raise issues of compatibility with freedom of association (sections , , ,  and  of the Criminal Code; and sections (c), (d) and  of the Labour Code). The Government indicates that, in accordance with the tripartite agreement signed at the ILO in November  and with a view to implementing the  road map adopted in the context of the complaint submitted in  under article  of the ILO Constitution concerning the non-observance by Guatemala of Convention No. , meetings and workshops have been held in the framework of the National Tripartite Committee on Labour Relations and Freedom of Association. The Government reports that the National Tripartite Committee considered Bill No.  of the Congress of the Republic, on approving amendments to Decree No.  of the Congress of the Republic (Labour Code), Decree No. '  of the Congress of the Republic (Act on Unionization and Regulation of Strike Action by State Employees), and Decree No. '  of the Congress of the Republic (Criminal Code). The Government also reports that, within the framework of that tripartite body, a consensus was reached on certain fundamental matters, such as the definition of essential services and the amendment of sections  and  of the Criminal Code. The Government refers in particular to section  of the Criminal Code concerning rebellion or sedition, which was amended by tripartite agreement so as to exclude from its scope lawful strikes carried out in accordance with the legislation in force. It further states that the National Tripartite Committee sent a letter to the Congress of the Republic on  May , informing it of the legislative matters on which a tripartite consensus had been reached and those still pending, and requesting the legislative body to defer its discussion of Bill No.  until a tripartite consensus is reached on the issues pending in the National Tripartite Committee.\n.In a communication of  September , the Government refers to the follow-up given to the ILO Governing Body decision of November  contained in document GB./INS/, which declared closed the above-mentioned procedure initiated under article  of the ILO Constitution. The Government emphasizes that, after having recognized the progress achieved by the country, the Governing Body: (i) highlighted the importance of elaborating and adopting legislative reforms that fully comply with point  of the road map (according to which the Government must take urgent action, in consultation with the tripartite constituents, to propose amendments to the Labour Code and the other relevant laws, incorporating the amendments which have long been proposed by the ILO supervisory bodies); and (ii) requested the Office to implement without delay a robust and comprehensive technical assistance programme to ensure the sustainability of the current social dialogue process as well as further progress in the implementation of the road map.\n.The Government states that, in June , in accordance with the above-mentioned decision of the Governing Body, the tripartite constituents approved a technical cooperation project on  Strengthening the National Tripartite Committee on Labour Relations and Freedom of Association in Guatemala for the effective application of international labour standards'  prepared by the Office. The Government highlights that one of the key aspects of this project is support for bringing legislation into conformity with the ILO Conventions on freedom of association through the work of the National Tripartite Committee. Lastly, the Government indicates that, on  August , the National Tripartite Committee approved its work plan for the period from May  to May , an objective of which is to reach agreement on legislative reforms involving the proposal of amendments to the Labour Code and other relevant laws, incorporating the amendments proposed by the ILO supervisory bodies.\n.By communication of  August , the Government transmits its observations concerning the alleged anti-union dismissal of  leaders and members of the Trade Union of Workers of the Municipality of San Carlos in the Department of Retalhuleu on  May . In this regard, the Government reports that:the worker Vilma Lucrecia Flores Rodas, having reached an out-of-court settlement with the defendant, withdrew the claim she had filed against the Municipality;the workers Marina Emrita Escobar Estacuy, Sofa Floridalma Lorenzo Martnez de Agustn, Alejandra Castillo Luis, Ingrid Nineth Valiente Navas de Torres, Norma Leticia Tem Alvarado, Pilar Cayax Lpez, Orlando Abigail Cifuentes Snchez and Carlos Roberto Barrios Chvez, having also reached an out-of-court settlement with the defendant, discontinued their respective proceedings;by a decision of  May , the worker Ranferi Fuentes Escobar had to drop his case, having failed to remedy several irregularities in his claim; andas for the claim filed by workers Olga Marina de Len and Bernab Rodas Benedicto, although the Municipality was initially exonerated, on  January  the court of second instance ordered their immediate reinstatement, which became effective on  August . Subsequently, at the request of the Municipality, a conciliation process was carried out between the parties and on  September  a payment agreement was reached between the above-mentioned trade unionists and the Municipality.\n.With regard to the allegation concerning the unlawful nomination of employers' and workers' representatives to the International Labour Conference, the Government states in its communication of  August  that Ministerial Agreement No. '  was not the subject of any administrative, legal or constitutional challenge and that, moreover, this agreement was repealed in its entirety by Ministerial Agreement No.  ?. With regard to the refusal to accredit the MSICG delegates, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare recognizes trade union movements but is unable to determine the representative status of those that do not have registers which make it possible to quantify their membership, a requirement that is established in the ILO Constitution, and that no longer applying this"", "".The complaint is contained in three communications from the Guatemalan Union, Indigenous and Peasant Movement (MSICG) dated  June and  September  and  January .\n.The Government sent its reply in four communications dated  August and  December ,  May  and  January .\n.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its three communications dated  June and  September  and  January , the MSICG alleges acts of interference, harassment and coercion by the enterprise, and to some extent by a trade union under the employer s control, obstruction of the right to organize, criminal prosecution of union leaders, bias on the part of the Public Prosecutor s Office and violations of due process.\n.In its communication of  June , the complainant organization states that on  October  the Workers' Union of the Santo Toms de Castilla Free Industry and Trade Zone (SINTRAFE) was established, with its support. It points out that before SINTRAFE was established, the only union operating in the Santo Toms de Castilla Free Industry and Trade Zone (hereinafter: the enterprise) was a union under the employer s control, which had full freedom to oblige other workers to join it.\n.The complainant indicates that on  January  the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (hereinafter: Ministry of Labour) granted official registration to SINTRAFE and that from about  March  a document began to circulate at the enterprise reportedly containing an appeal against the registration of SINTRAFE on the grounds that: (i) the union members had provided false documentation for establishing the union; (ii) Mr Exon Eduardo Lainfiesta Perdomo and Mr Jonnathan Christian Heimen Bentez, two workers at the enterprise whose names and signatures appear in the union s act of constitution, claimed not to have signed the act or given their consent, and so they filed a complaint with the Public Prosecutor s Office; (iii) after learning of these irregularities, Mr Juan Jos Merlo Llanes, a SINTRAFE member whose name also reportedly appeared in the act of constitution, resigned definitively from the union; and (iv) the consent of other SINTRAFE founder members was vitiated.\n.The complainant organization indicates that the appeal against the registration was devised by the legal representative of the enterprise in order to prevent the establishment of a new trade union at the enterprise. Moreover, it objects that since the registration of SINTRAFE, the enterprise, and to some extent the union under the employer s control, launched a campaign of harassment against the workers at the enterprise, seeking to discourage them from joining the new union; and that the enterprise engaged in coercion and harassment of SINTRAFE leaders and members, threatening them with criminal prosecution to make them resign from the union and declare that they did not sign the union s act of constitution. Furthermore, the complainant alleges that Mr Lainfiesta Perdomo, Mr Merlo Llanes and Mr Heimen Bentez joined the union and took part in union training, in collusion with the enterprise, with the sole objective of destroying the new union; that the other union members, by sworn statements, contradicted those workers' statements; and that neither Mr Lainfiesta Perdomo nor Mr Merlo Llanes made any reference in their resignation to supposedly illegal action by the union.\n.The complainant organization states that on  June  the Ministry of Labour, in Administrative Decision No. -, dismissed the appeal filed by the enterprise, and this decision was challenged by the enterprise on  September  in the Labour and Social Welfare Court of First Instance (hereinafter: Labour Court) in the department of Izabal. Firstly, the complainant indicates, in response to the appeal filed by the enterprise on  March , that SINTRAFE filed a criminal complaint with the Public Prosecutor s Office against the legal representative of the enterprise and the above-mentioned workers for offences of falsification and coercion. Secondly, it denounces the criminal prosecution to which four SINTRAFE leaders were subjected: on  October  ' seven months after the criminal complaint filed by the union against the legal representative of the enterprise and the two workers referred to above ' the enterprise filed a complaint against union leaders Mr Ral Chvez Snchez (SINTRAFE general secretary), Mr Toms Lares Lpez (labour and disputes secretary), Ms Nora Baibely Aquino Lpez (records and agreements secretary) and Mr Elvin Antonio Godoy Berganza (organization and publicity secretary), accusing them of falsification with regard to the act of constitution, despite the fact that the authority to establish such a deed lay with a person other than the union leaders.\n.As regards the union s complaint against the legal representative and the two workers referred to above, the complainant organization indicates that: (i) it specifically stated that the complaint should not be referred to the Special Investigation Unit for Crimes against Trade Unionists because it considered that the unit s prosecutor was biased against complaints filed by the MSICG; (ii) the Public Prosecutor s Office, disregarding the complainant s request, referred the complaint to the above-mentioned unit; (iii) the unit s prosecutor held onto the complaint until  December  without taking any action, thereby giving time for the criminal complaint filed by the enterprise on  October  against four SINTRAFE leaders to be admitted for processing; (iv) when the complaint was referred to the Investigation Unit for Discrimination Offences, the plaintiffs, because of the court orders preventing them from leaving their area resulting from the criminal prosecution filed by the enterprise against four SINTRAFE leaders, could not travel to Guatemala City to submit their statements; and (v) they allege unlawful action by the prosecutor in covering up and ensuring impunity for the perpetrators and instigators of the offences committed against the trade unionists.\n.The complainant organization also reports irregularities in the judicial proceedings for the four SINTRAFE leaders, making the following allegations: (i) that the complaint filed by the enterprise was processed extremely quickly, by comparison with the complaint filed by the union, in that the courts usually take over a year to grant a hearing and in the present case there was only one month between the date the hearing was requested ( August ) and the date the hearing was held ( September ); (ii) that during the hearing of  September  at the Criminal Court (of First Instance) for Drug Trafficking Offences and Environmental Crimes in the department of Izabal, the judge interrupted and prevented the defence counsel, in a totally biased manner, from presenting his arguments and conducting his technical defence, and ordered that the union leaders be placed in temporary custody; (iii) that the judge also considered it lawful that the Public Prosecutor s Office had not previously informed the union leaders of the existence of criminal proceedings against them and that they had not been summoned to submit a statement, a situation which is contrary to section  of the Code of Criminal Procedure, which establishes that on no account shall the Public Prosecutor s Office bring charges before giving the accused the opportunity to make a statement; (iv) that the accused were not given a copy of the case file, and this affected their right of defence; and (v) that the judge allegedly allowed the enterprise to intervene as a joint plaintiff with the Public Prosecutor s Office, on the grounds that the enterprise had suffered serious financial losses ' amounting to more than , quetzales (GTQ) ' as a result of the union being established.\n.Alongside these actions, the enterprise allegedly called for the termination of the employment contract of the SINTRAFE labour and disputes secretary, Mr Toms Lares Lpez, despite the fact that his union term of office ended on  February , which meant that he could not be dismissed without a valid reason. This case is pending in the Labour Court in the context of socio-economic collective dispute No. -. In addition, the legal representative of the enterprise reportedly brought criminal proceedings against the same leader for defamation, on account of statements made in the social media, and the complainant organization indicates that the complaint was admitted for processing by the Criminal Court for Drug Trafficking Offences and Environmental Crimes, even though the conditions for instituting legal proceedings had not been met.\n.Furthermore, the complainant alleges to have been the victim of extortion, in that, just after the four leaders had gone to the Criminal Rehabilitation Centre in Puerto Barrios on  September , the MSICG office began to receive calls from a person identified as a representative of the prison sector to which Mr Lares Lpez had been transferred, demanding a deposit of GTQ,, otherwise the union leader would be  dispatched to the other side'  in other words, he would be murdered, and so the complainant was obliged to make this payment. This incident was reported to the International Commission against"", "".In its previous examination of the case, the Committee presented an interim report to the Governing Body [see th Report, paras ' , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (October November )].\n.Following this examination, the Workers' Union of the Guatemalan Olympic Committee (SITRACOGUA) sent additional information in a communication dated  February .\n.The Government provided additional observations in communications dated  February ,  January and  August .\n.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its previous examination of the case in October , the Committee made the following recommendations on matters still pending [see th Report, para. ]:(a) The Committee requests the complainant organizations to indicate clearly the identity and the exact number of workers belonging to SITRACOGUA who were dismissed on  January .(b) The Committee strongly hopes that the legal challenge to the dismissal of the founding members of SITRACOGUA will soon be examined and that, in the event that the decision of first instance upholds the request for reinstatement issued by the General Labour Inspectorate, all necessary measures will be taken to ensure that the workers will be effectively and immediately reinstated. The Committee requests the Government to inform it urgently in this regard.(c) The Committee strongly hopes that the investigation of the Office of the Attorney-General into the acts of discrimination, coercion and violence against members of SITRACOGUA will be completed without further delay. The Committee requests the Government to inform it urgently in this regard.(d) The Committee requests the Government to ensure that the competent authorities have examined the aforementioned request for protection measures for the union leaders, Ms Marina Garca and Ms Suleima de Len, in a timely, appropriate manner and to inform it urgently of the decisions taken in this regard.(e) The Committee trusts that the interventions of the various aforementioned public institutions will ensure the free exercise of freedom of association and collective bargaining within the Guatemalan Olympic Committee.\n.In a communication dated  February , SITRACOGUA provides additional information regarding the allegations examined by the Committee pertaining to this case. The complainants emphasize that: (i)  workers belonging to SITRACOGUA were dismissed on  January ; (ii)  of the  workers filed a request for reinstatement (Ms Suleima Adaia de Len Segura, Ms Mariana Melina Garca Hernndez, Mr Sergio Eduardo Goln Diaz, Ms Tania Rubi Lpez Figueroa, Mr Charles Michel Legrand Aceituno, Ms Estela Marina Sosa Arroyave, Mr Pablo Renato Garca Flores, Ms Jessica Rosmery Lemus Herrera, Ms Carolina Raquel Pereira Meja, Mr Marvin Geovani Gmez Alvarado, Ms Vivian Lucrecia Morales, Mr Hugo Esmaily Diaz de Len, Mr Mario Antonio Mendoza Pineda, Ms Karyn Odilia Ochoa Ruano, Mr Shayne Mariveth Ruiz Palomo and Mr Pedro Herrarte Pineda); (iii) on  July , the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal filed by the Guatemalan Olympic Committee (hereinafter  the sports institution'  against the registration of SITRACOGUA; (iv) there has been no response from the Office of the Prosecutor-General of Human Rights regarding the complaint made (by SITRACOGUA) on  March ; (v) a partial follow-up to the complaint was given before the Public Prosecutor s Office on  November , and the hearing before the second chamber of the criminal branch of the lower court with several judges was suspended, owing to the failure of the sports institution s executive committee to appear; (vi) to date, the labour courts have not issued a ruling on the complaints filed by SITRACOGUA and its members because of the sports institution s legal delaying tactics; (vii) the examination of the case, between  May and  December , by the Committee for the Settlement of Disputes before the ILO in the Area of Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining was totally ineffective, due to the employer s lack of willingness to come to an agreement and the failure of the committee s chairperson to take any action; (viii) the anti-union attitude of the leaders of the sports institution was made clear when they came before the committee and proposed that the workers who had been dismissed, despite enjoying immunity from dismissal, be reinstated on condition that they resign the following day; (ix) reprisals by the sports institution continue against members of the SITRACOGUA executive committee, including the two-day suspension from duty without pay imposed on the union s finance secretary, Mr Joel Zecea Garca, and the two-day suspension from duty without pay imposed on Mr Luis Arturo Chinchilla Gmez, for using the time granted to them for union activities to attend the criminal hearing on  November  against the sports institution; during that hearing, Mr Chinchilla was subjected to intimidation by a person close to the institution s general manager; and (x) on  December , SITRACOGUA submitted a draft collective agreement on working conditions, but this did not lead to any negotiations with the sports institution; rather, the latter forwarded the draft to the Office of the Attorney-General, claiming it to be prejudicial in nature.\n.In its communications dated  February ,  January and  August , the Government begins by providing information on the judicial proceedings relating to compliance with labour legislation raised in this case, noting that: (i) in a ruling dated  July , the Constitutional Court rejected the appeal filed by the sports institution against the registration of SITRACOGUA; (ii) on  July , the th labour and social welfare court issued a ruling on the appeal filed by Mr Joel Zecea Garca and Mr Luis Arturo Chinchilla against the disciplinary sanctions (two-day suspensions) imposed on them by the sports institution, and ordered it to refrain from carrying out reprisals against SITRACOGUA members and to revoke and annul the aforementioned disciplinary sanctions imposed on Mr Joel Zecea Garca and Mr Luis Arturo Chinchilla within three days; (iii) however, in a ruling dated  August , subsequently confirmed in appeal, it declared inadmissible proceedings brought before the regular labour court by Mr Joel Zecea Garca against the sports institution; (iv) the proceedings brought before the regular labour court by several of the sports institution s workers to seek reinstatement are still pending while the Supreme Court of Justice examines in appeal the request for a joinder of proceedings filed by the sports institution; and (v) the complaint filed by SITRACOGUA with the Office of the Prosecutor-General of Human Rights was closed because the allegations made were already known to the labour and social welfare courts.\n.The Government then provides information on the criminal proceedings instituted in connection with the allegations made in the present case, indicating that: (i) the third criminal court responsible for narcotics offences and crimes against the environment in Guatemala City, acting as an amparo court, in a ruling dated  April  dismissed the criminal complaint filed by SITRACOGUA against the executives of the sports institution alleging offences of discrimination, violence against women and coercion, as it considered there were no grounds for subjecting the sports institution s executives to a public oral hearing for offences against the institution s union; (ii) the special investigation unit for offences committed against trade unionists within the Public Prosecutor s Office filed an appeal against this ruling; and (iii) finding that there was insufficient factual evidence, the Public Prosecutor s Office dismissed the complaint alleging intimidation and reprisals filed by Mr Zecea against the executives of the sports institution after an individual close to the institution s executive committee had apparently recorded Mr Zecea during a criminal hearing.\n.With regard to the request for protection measures for the union leaders Ms Marina Garca and Ms Suleima de Len, the Government states that the Ministry of the Interior indicates that there has been no request for a risk assessment for these two individuals. The Government further notes that the unit for offences committed against trade unionists within the Public Prosecutor s Office did request safety measures for Mr Joel Zecea, Ms Dora Marina de Len Benavente and Ms Magda Azucena Rosas Flores; however, it did not request safety measures for Ms Marina Garca and Ms Suleima de Len, given that these two persons had filed complaints relating only to their dismissals and coercion against union members.\n.Lastly, the Government states that: (i) the mediation process within the Committee for the Settlement of Disputes before the ILO in the Area of Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining in connection with the dismissal of members failed because of the inflexible positions of the parties, and the committee s independent mediator apologized to SITRACOGUA for failing to inform it of the outcome of the session of  July ; and (ii) the Office of the Attorney-General indicated that there is no record on file of any declaration to the effect that a collective agreement on working conditions signed between the sports institution and its workers' union is prejudicial.\n.The Committee recalls that this""]"

The requests were refused, leaving the organizations without leadership. The confederation requests the Committee to overturn these decisions because they are inconsistent with legislation, the Constitution and the aforementioned Conventions.\n.In its communication dated  April , the Government refers, on the one hand, to the complainants' allegations concerning the imposition of conditions not provided for in the Constitution or legislation for registering the executive committees of first-, second- and third-level trade unions. In this connection, the Government considers that the allegations are unwarranted and baseless, given that the conditions imposed by the DNOS of the MTPS for registering executive committees can be found in domestic legal regulations. The Government indicates that the requirement to provide photocopies of the individual identity documents of the persons elected to executive committees is provided for in section  of the Special Act on Regulating the Issuance of the Individual Identity Document, which provides that:  the individual identity document is the official document, which is sufficient and necessary to identify unequivocally all natural persons who are nationals of El Salvador in any public or private act, both at home and abroad'  this being the only valid document through which persons who are members of executive committees can be identified. Similarly, this condition would be consistent with the requirements for membership of executive committees set out in section () and () of the Labour Code that members should be nationals of El Salvador by birth and over the age of . With regard to the requirement to attach to the request the payslip or employment certificate, they are required pursuant to section () of the Labour Code, which provides that membership of an executive committee also requires members  not to be employed in positions of trust or representatives of the employer'  This requirement therefore serves to corroborate the strict employment relationship between the persons elected and the institution or enterprise for which they provide their services, and emphasizes that this requirement does not apply in the case of independent unions. With regard to the requirement to provide a list of all persons present when the executive committee was elected, the Government states that this requirement is intended to verify that the members of the executive committee were actually present at the assembly in question, given that cases have been reported of elected persons not being present at the assembly during which they were elected, as well as to ensure that the number of votes matches the number of persons present at the meeting.\n.The Government also indicates, with regard to the registration of the CNTS executive committee, that this confederation submitted documentation on  July  and that documentation verifying the members of its executive committee was submitted on  August . With regard to the registration of the executive committee of the STIASSYC, the Government notes that, on  December , this union submitted documentation for the registration of its executive committee, that on  January  it was notified that it had to submit a list of all its members, including their full names and copies of their individual identity documents. These documents were provided and the executive committee was registered on  January .\n.With regard to the confidentiality of documents forwarded by trade unions, the Government indicates that, in order to safeguard the extreme confidentiality of the documents requested, as well as the legal security of executive committees, the accreditations of members of executive committees should not be sent by post, and that the DNOS recently adopted a directive to notify each executive committee by telephone when their accreditation and cards are ready for collection.\n.Lastly, the Government states that the trade union organizations SITRACH, SITRACCAC, SIPORACESS, SITRAINCOP, SIPROTES and SITRACL have been left without leadership because, even though they were given time to address any shortcomings in their applications, namely to submit the individual identity documents of their executive committee members, the above unions failed to submit any of the documents requested and their applications were therefore declared inadmissible.\n.The Committee observes that this case refers, firstly, to the alleged imposition of arbitrary conditions for registering trade union executive committees and the issuing of accreditation to their members and to the subsequent refusal of the labour administration to register the executive committees of a number of trade union organizations and, second, to alleged irregularities in the elections of worker representatives in tripartite bodies.\n.With regard to the alleged imposition of arbitrary conditions for registering trade union executive committees, the Committee notes that the complainants allege in general terms that: (i) the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MTPS) makes the registration of executive committees dependent on the submission of the individual identity documents and payslips of members of those committees, as well as the signed list of the members of the union who were present at its general assembly; (ii) the conditions imposed are both unduly demanding and arbitrary, given that they are not provided for in legislation; and (iii) the imposition of the conditions in question were intended to obstruct the processes and procedures for the election of executive committees that did not support the Government at the time the complaint was presented and to prevent their members from being elected to various tripartite bodies. The Committee further notes, more specifically, that: (i) the National Confederation of Workers of El Salvador (CNTS) alleges that the MTPS refused to register two members of its executive committee because, firstly, it had failed to submit the payslip of a union official and, second, that another union official, elected to the post of organization secretary, only worked on a casual basis; (ii) the CNTS alleges that, on  August , the National Department of Social Organizations (DNOS) had requested the Union of Workers in the Cotton, Synthetics, Similar or Related Industries (STIASSYC) to provide an updated list of all members of the trade union; and (iii) the Trade Union Council of El Salvador (CONSISAL) alleges that the DNOS arbitrarily refused to register and issue accreditation for the executive committees of  trade unions affiliated to its confederation.\n.The Committee observes that the Government states with regard to the alleged imposition of arbitrary conditions that: (i) section  of the Special Act on Regulating the Issuance of the Individual Identity Document provides that the document in question is the only valid document through which persons who are elected as members of executive committees can be identified; (ii) one of the requirements for membership of executive committees under section () and () of the Labour Code is for members to be Salvadoran by birth and have attained the age of majority; (iii) section () of the Labour Code provides that one of the requirements for membership of executive committees is for members not to be employed in positions of trust or representatives of the employer, hence the requirement to attach to the request the payslip and employment certificate; and (iv) the requirement for the list of those present at the assembly where the members of the executive committee were elected arises from the need to check that the persons who are members of the executive committee were present at the assembly and to verify whether the number of votes matches the number of persons present. With regard to the specific allegations concerning the refusal to register  executive committees, the Committee observes that the Government indicates that: (i) the executive committees of"", ""the CNTS and the STIASSYC were registered once any shortcomings in meeting the conditions imposed by the DNOS had been addressed; and (ii) the trade union organizations SITRACH, SITRACCAC, SIPORACESS, SITRAINCOP, SIPROTES and SITRACL failed to submit the documentation requested and that is why they have been left without leadership.\n.The Committee recalls that it has already had occasion in the past to examine allegations of the imposition of excessive conditions for the registration of executive committees in El Salvador. In Case No.  [see th Report, para. ], the Committee had noted the Government s indication that, in order to register members of executive committees, trade unions should, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, submit a copy of their individual identity documents and payslips to verify whether executive committee members were Salvadorans by birth and had attained the age of majority, and that they were not employed in positions of trust or representatives of the employer. On that occasion, the Committee had recalled concerning the requirement to be Salvadoran by birth that legislation should be made flexible so as to permit the organizations to elect their leaders freely and without hindrance, and to permit foreign workers access to trade union posts, at least after a reasonable period of residence in the host country [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ].\n.The Committee therefore refers to its conclusions in Case No.  concerning the requirement to be Salvadoran by birth and again expresses the hope that the Government will take all steps, including legislative measures, to ensure that section  of the Labour Code and its application are consistent with the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom. Regarding the allegation of the CNTS concerning the refusal of the labour administration to register one of its executive committee members because of the casual nature of his work, the Committee recalls that it is the prerogative of workers' and employers' organizations to determine the conditions for electing their leaders and the authorities should refrain from any undue interference in the exercise of the right of workers' and employers' organizations freely to elect their representatives, which is guaranteed by Convention No.  [see Compilation, op. cit., , para. ]. Recalling that all workers must be able to enjoy the right to freedom of association regardless of the type of contract by which the employment relationship has been formalized [see Compilation, op. cit., , para. ] , the Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that, irrespective of the worker s type of contract, trade unions may freely appoint members of their executive committees. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.\n.As for the complainants' specific allegations regarding the refusal to register  executive committees, the Committee observes that: (i) the Government provides its observations on eight of the  trade unions concerned, indicating that two executive committees were registered once any shortcomings in meeting the conditions imposed by the labour administration had been addressed, while the applications of the other six organizations were declared inadmissible due to the failure to submit the documentation required; and (ii) it is clear from the above, as well as from the complainants' allegations, that most of the trade unions mentioned in the complaint have been left without leadership. Considering that the accreditation procedures for workers' organizations and their executive committees should include formal verifications carried out expeditiously and in a consistent manner, the Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the most representative trade union organizations, to take the necessary steps to review the rules applicable to the registration of executive committees in order to guarantee the right of organizations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to ensure a swift process. In the light of the foregoing, the Committee requests the Government, in consultation with the organizations concerned, to expedite the pending registrations of the executive committees of the trade unions mentioned in this case. Reminding the Government that it can avail itself of ILO assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n.Concerning the steps taken by the Government to exclude trade unions that do not support the Government from various tripartite bodies, and the irregularities in the appointment of worker representatives in those bodies, alleged by the CONSISAL, the Committee notes that, according to this complainant: (i) during the elections of the National Minimum Wage Council, on  December , the Government, ignoring the institution s regulations adopted by tripartite consensus, elected four persons from pro-Government trade unions; (ii) during the elections of governor members of the Housing Social Fund, the Government had altered the number of members of the Union of Construction and Related Workers to prevent any of its representatives from participating in that body and had increased the number of members from a pro-Government trade union with the aim of increasing its representation in the governors' assembly; and (iii) during the elections of worker representatives to the Higher Labour Council, after the appointment of a majority of representatives from trade unions that were not pro-Government, the tripartite body was left without leadership, and nothing has been done to date to remedy the situation.\n.While noting that the Government did not transmit its observations on this matter, the Committee observes that the allegations made by the complainant relating to the suspension of the Higher Labour Council are still being examined by the Committee in Case No. . In this case, the Committee underlined the urgent need for in-depth consultations with the confederations and federations in order to establish clear and stable rules for the appointment of worker representatives to the CST (particularly when there is no single list of worker representatives) which respect the criterion of representativeness and requested the Government to keep it informed in this regard. Taking into account the urgency of this situation the Committee also invited the Government to accept an ILO technical assistance mission to help in finding a solution to the issues raised [see th Report, para. ]..Observing that the ILO has been providing technical assistance to the Government in respect of the determination of criteria to establish trade union representation, the Committee refers to its recommendations in Case No.  and urges the Government to reactivate the Higher Labour Council as soon as possible.\n.With regard to the alleged irregularities in the appointment of worker representatives to the National Minimum Wage Council and the Housing Social Fund, the Committee recalls that it has already had occasion to examine similar allegations in Case No.  a case brought by an employers' organization. In that case, the Committee requested the Government to ensure that the representatives of workers' and employers' organizations on tripartite bodies are appointed by them freely, and that in-depth consultations are urgently held with those organizations within the Higher Labour Council, so that mutual agreement can be reached on ensuring the balanced tripartite composition of the management boards of the autonomous institutions referred to in the complaint (notably the ISSS, the FSV and the NIVT), and that the shared decision so reached is submitted without delay to the Legislative Assembly in the course of its examination of the legislative reform previously proposed by the Government. [see th Report, para. ]. Regretting that no progress has been made in that respect, the Committee insists, once again, that pre-established, precise and objective criteria for the determination of the representativity of workers' and employers' organizations should exist in the legislation and such a determination should not be left to the discretion of governments [see Compilation, op. cit., para. ]. In view of the above, the Committee urges the Government to respond without delay to the allegations made by the complainant regarding the appointment of worker representatives in the National Minimum Wage Council and the Housing Social Fund. The Committee also expresses the hope that the Government will ensure that the appointment of worker representatives to tripartite bodies will be based on objective, precise and pre-established criteria on representativity, and that any dispute as to the appointment of those representatives will be resolved by an independent body. Regretting that this situation has persisted for years, and reminding the Government that it can continue to benefit from the Office s technical assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:(a)\tThe Committee refers to its conclusions in Case No.  regarding the requirement to be Salvadoran by birth and again expresses the hope that the Government will take all steps, including legislative measures, to ensure that section  of the Labour Code and its application are consistent with the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom.(b)\tThe Committee requests the Government to take appropriate steps to ensure that, irrespective of the worker s type of contract, trade unions may freely appoint members"", 'pending registrations of the executive committees of the trade unions mentioned in this case. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard;(e) With regard to the suspension of the Higher Labour Council, the Committee refers to its recommendations in Case No.  and urges the Government to reactivate the Higher Labour Council as soon as possible.(f) As for the alleged irregularities in the appointment of worker representatives to the National Minimum Wage Council and the Housing Social Fund, the Committee urges the Government to respond without delay to the allegations made by the complainant and expresses the hope that the Government will ensure that the appointment of worker representatives to tripartite bodies will be based on objective, precise and pre-established criteria on representativeness, and that any dispute as to the appointment of those representatives will be resolved by an independent body. Regretting that this situation has persisted for years, and reminding the Government that it can continue to benefit from the Office s technical assistance, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard.\n.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  October  from the National Confederation of Workers of El Salvador (CNTS), and in two communications dated  June and  October  from the Trade Union Council of El Salvador (CONSISAL).\n.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .\n.El Salvador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  October , the National Confederation of Workers of El Salvador (CNTS) alleges that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (MTPS) is imposing arbitrary conditions, which are not specified either in the Constitution or in legislation, for registering trade union executive committees and the issuing of accreditation to their members, including the requirement to provide the payslips and individual identity documents of executive committee members. According to the complainant, the Government s intention in not granting full accreditation to executive committee members was to leave both its trade union confederation and affiliated organizations without leadership in order to obstruct their participation in tripartite and bipartite bodies and prevent the organizations concerned from demanding that the labour rights of their members be upheld in accordance with applicable collective agreements.\n.The CNTS notes that, on  July , it submitted a request for the registration of its new executive committee to the National Department of Social Organizations (DNOS) of the MTPS. On  July , the complainant was notified in a decision issued by the DNOS that, in order to proceed with the registration of the new executive committee, the confederation had to submit a new record showing the exact number of persons present at the time voting took place, as well as an uncertified copy of the payslips or certificate of salary payment of the persons elected to the executive committee. This requirement had to be met within five working days from the day after the notification.\n.On  August , the DNOS notified the CNTS that it was apparent from an analysis of the documents submitted that the conditions had only been partially met and that, as a result, the following vacancies remained open: (i) secretary for agricultural and environmental matters because, given that no payslip was submitted, it was not possible to verify the employment relationship between the worker and the enterprise; and (ii) organization secretary because, given that the union member elected, Mr Cesar Emilio Zetino Consuegra, works for the Los Lagartos agricultural production cooperative association, a limited liability enterprise, and as a casual worker in the sugar cane and coffee industry, he would be excluded from being a member of the executive committee under the terms of section (a) of the Labour Code.\n.In addition, the complainant alleges that, on  August , the DNOS requested the Union of Workers in the Cotton, Synthetics, Similar or Related Industries (STIASSYC) to provide an updated list of all members of the trade union, likewise giving a deadline of five working days to provide the document.\n.With respect to the above-mentioned conditions, in the complainant s view: (i) no provisions of section  of the Labour Code stipulate that payslips and individual identity documents must be requested; (ii) the decision to exclude Mr Zetino Consuegra from becoming organization secretary because he was a casual worker in the sugar cane and coffee industry is erroneous pursuant to section (a) of the Labour Code, given that this provision has nothing to do with prohibiting casual workers from being members of union executive committees and, if that were the case, the provision would be discriminatory and contrary to articles  and  of the Constitution; and (iii) the conditions imposed on its confederation and other affiliated organizations are not found in ILO Conventions, in the Constitution of El Salvador or in legislation and, therefore, imposing such conditions would constitute an arbitrary act.\n.In a communication dated  June , the Trade Union Council of El Salvador (CONSISAL) alleges that the MTPS refused to register and grant accreditation to the executive committees of  unions affiliated to its confederation (the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the San Jos de la Montaa Canton (SITRAM), the General Trade Union of Workers in the Fishing and Allied Industries (SGTIPAC), the Independent Union of Commercial Workers in Colonia Las Flores (SITRACOF), the Independent Union of Retail Workers in Jerusaln (SICOJ), the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the El Espino Canton (SITRACE), the Union of Independent Craftspersons in Santa Mara Ostuma (SINAISMO), the Trade Union Federation of Registered Workers of El Salvador (FESTRAIS), the Trade Union Federation of Agricultural and Commercial Workers (FESTRAC), the Western Trade Union Association of Small Retailers (ASPECO), the Association of Merchant Seafarers of El Salvador (AMMS), the Independent Union of Agricultural Workers in the Tepeagua Canton (SITRACT), the Union of Agricultural Producers in the San Felipe Canton (SIPROACASF), the Union of Independent Commercial Workers in Nueva San Salvador (SITICONSS), the Union of Agricultural Workers in the Achichilco Canton (SINTRACA), the Union of Commercial Workers in La Unin (SITRACUN), the Union of Agricultural Workers in the La Labor Canton (SITRACL), the Independent Union of Artisanal Fishers in Zacatecoluca (SINPEZ), the Independent Union of Professionals and Technicians of El Salvador (SIPROTES), the Union of Agricultural Producers in Santo Domingo (SIPROASD) and the Union of Small Agricultural Producers in the Galeano Canton (SIPEACG)), leaving them without leadership.\n.The complainant considers that the line of action taken by the DNOS is aimed at eliminating all trade unions that are not sympathetic to the Government s political aspirations, by obstructing the processes and procedures for their formation and for the election of executive committees. The complainant considers that the imposition of conditions not provided for in labour regulations, and the subsequent ineligibility of the requests attached to the conditions, was aimed at leaving the trade unions without leadership, and further considers that the Government intends to base its measures on the provisions of sections ,  and  of the Labour Code, sections (b) and (b) of the Act on the Organization and Functions of the Labour and Social Welfare Sector and the Special Act on Regulating the Issuance of the Individual Identity Document, and considers, with respect to the latter law, that this is not a labour regulation and therefore does not apply to the registration of executive committees and the issuing of accreditation to their members.\n.The complainant points out that the documentation required, namely photocopies of individual identity documents (or, failing this, the birth certificates or passports of each elected member), payslips (or any other document verifying the names or posts held by the workers in the places where they work, such as certificates of salary payment stamped and signed by the human resources manager of the enterprises where the elected workers carry out their duties as members of the executive committee) and the submission of a list of members (in original or photocopy, stamped and signed by all members present at the session of the general assembly at which the members of the executive committee were elected), is excessive and contains private data and classified information on each individual.\n.The complainant also states that the imposition of conditions not provided for in labour regulations is a strategy devised by the Farabundo Mart National Liberation Front (FMLN), the party in power at the time the complaint was submitted, as a way to prevent participation in the tripartite bodies by majority organizations that do not support the Government and that are part of the Salvadorian Labour Movement.\n.The complainant also alleges irregularities in the elections of worker members in various tripartite councils, referring in particular to: (i) the election of members to the National Minimum Wage Council on  December , when the Government, far from adhering to the procedure laid down in current regulations adopted by tripartite consensus,']"

SUTE CHILE sent additional information in communications dated  February  and  January .\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  July  and  December .\n.In view of the nature of the issues raised in the complaints, Cases Nos  (FENASICOM) and  (SUTE CHILE) will be examined together by the Committee on Freedom of Association.\n.Chile has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).\n.In a communication dated  August , the Union Assistants' National Federation for Municipal Education Corporation Workers in Chile (FENASICOM) alleges that the draft Act establishing a public education system and amending various legal texts, which was submitted to the Chamber of Deputies in November , does not include the right to organize of non-teaching personnel in educational establishments, their right to bargain collectively, nor their resulting right to strike. The complainant organization explains that, in accordance with Act No.  of  July , education assistant personnel who work in educational establishments under the authority of private, non-profit corporations created by councils to manage municipal education have a right to bargain collectively to establish working conditions and terms of employment and remuneration, thanks to an exceptional legal provision. Such right is not extended to teaching assistant personnel working in educational establishments under the authority of education administration departments, who are subject to the provisions of Act No.  on civil servants' associations.\n.FENASICOM alleges that the draft act ' which aims to create a single system managed by decentralized public bodies by transferring personnel who work for the private corporations mentioned ' violates the right to freedom of association, since section  prescribes that  starting from the date of education service transfer, a period of two years shall be granted for the trade unions representing the transferred personnel to merge, amend their statutes in accordance with Act No.  and switch to being governed by such provisions for all legal purposes following the submission of the amended statutes to the Labour Inspectorate'  According to the trade union organization, this means that trade unions have two years to dissolve their organizations and become civil servants' associations or else they will cease to function, in violation of Article  of Convention No. .\n.In a communication dated  September , the National Federation of Education Workers (SUTE CHILE) indicates that the draft act establishing the public education system (Official Gazette No. -) seeks to give the public education system a new institutional structure. The complainant organization explains that the legislative reform will mean that the public education system has three levels: (i) the Directorate of Public Education, a centralized public service under the authority of the Ministry of Education; (ii) local public education services, which will be decentralized public services with a legal personality and their own assets, and (iii) educational establishments (education professionals and assistants). In that regard, it explains that the existing educational establishments report to the municipalities either directly, through the Municipal Education Administration Department (DAEM ' a public body), or indirectly, through its municipal corporations (private law corporations), employees of which will, with the entry into force of the law, be transferred to local services. On that basis, education professionals and assistants organize either as civil servants' associations or as trade unions, depending on whether their contractual ties are with the municipality through the DAEM or with a municipal corporation. According to the draft act, the legal successor to the DAEM or the municipal corporation will be the respective local service.\n.With respect to the transfer of personnel, the complainant organization explains that the transitional provisions of the draft act regulate three different situations: (i) the transfer of municipal personnel; (ii) the transfer of municipal personnel governed by the Teacher s Statute to posts within local services; and (iii) the transfer of educational establishment personnel. The complainant organization stresses that the third type of transfer will be carried out  with no break in service'  as, owing to a legal fiction, the transfer of education professionals and assistants from the municipality or municipal corporation to local services will not affect the seniority of workers or the legal provisions applicable to them. Thus, education professionals will continue to be governed by Act No.  on the statute of education professionals, as well as the Teacher s Statute, and education assistants will continue to be governed by Act No. , which establishes that the legal regime for such workers is the Labour Code.\n.The complainant organization indicates that the abovementioned draft act contains no provisions on the freedom of association of education workers with respect to either existing or future trade union relations; it therefore expresses concern about the uncertain future of trade unions following the transfers. In addition, the complainant organization expresses concern about the fact that education professionals and assistants will, following their transfer to local services, report to a public institution, meaning that they will, without exception, only be able to organize in accordance with the provisions of Act No.  on public sector workers, which does not provide for the right to bargain collectively or the right to strike. Accordingly, education sector workers will have only one aspect of freedom of association recognized (the organizational aspect). The complainant organization therefore alleges that the draft act will prohibit such workers from exercising the rights to bargain collectively and to strike.\n.The complainant organization explains that, according to the principle of continuity enshrined in section  of the Labour Code, existing trade union organizations will remain operational. However, the application of the principle of the continuity of collective rights will be in conflict with the public nature of the new employing entity ' the local services ' which means that workers affiliated to trade unions will have to transfer to a civil servants' association. This raises questions with respect to: (i) the recognition by the employer of the rights acquired through collective bargaining; (ii) the right to bargain collectively formerly enjoyed under the previous legislation by education assistants reporting to municipal corporations; and (iii) the collective bargaining carried out by education professionals reporting to municipal corporations.\n.The complainant organization refers to section  of the draft act (section  of Act No. ), on civil servants' associations, indicating that all workers transferred to a public service will only be able to form associations in accordance with Act No.  (regulations applicable to public sector workers), that existing trade union organizations will have two years to amend their statutes and become civil servants' associations, and that those associations will, in turn, have one year to meet the quorum set out in section  of Act No. .\n.According to the complainant organization, the abovementioned draft act constitutes a step backwards because: (i) education sector workers, who have historically exercised the right to bargain collectively, will be deprived of a right recognized and guaranteed by the Constitution and various ratified international treaties; (ii) it does not guarantee the continuity of existing trade union organizations after the change in employer; and (iii) such organizations must not only become civil servants' associations but also meet the quorums regulated by the Civil Servants' Associations Act, in the knowledge that the transfer to a local service will increase the total number of workers and thus the quorum requirement.\n.In a communication dated  February  referring to the  Position of the Ministry of Education regarding the labour situation of education assistants reporting to municipal corporations in the context of the draft act establishing the public education system' (May , Official Gazette No. -), SUTE CHILE notes that, as a result of the move to the new public institutional structure, workers affiliated to trade unions are obliged to dissolve their trade union organizations and lose the right to bargain collectively. It also alleges that the draft act denies assistants (as well as professionals) the status of civil servants, making them workers with duties of a public nature but no public sector guarantees as civil servants.\n.In a communication dated  January , SUTE CHILE reiterated its criticisms of Act No. , as promulgated on  November , on the grounds that: (i) it violates the principle of continuity and labour stability (transitional sections ,  and ); (ii) it violates the right to freedom of association (transitional section ), as it gives new grounds for dissolving trade union organizations; it does not recognize the rights to bargain collectively and to strike of civil servants' associations from the education sector, whether they be existing civil servants' associations or trade unions that will become civil servants' associations after the transfer of workers to local education services;"", ""and (iii) there is no recognition of the rights that education workers' trade unions have acquired through collective bargaining. SUTE CHILE reiterates that the Act does not respect current regulations for education assistant personnel, which recognize their rights to bargain collectively and to strike. Lastly, the organization alleges that, since the adoption of Act No. , many complaints have been received from education workers in relation to mass dismissals.\n.In its communications dated  July  and  December , which refer to both cases, the Government provides information about: (i) the Chilean school system and the reasons for improving the municipal system of public education; (ii) the situation of education assistants in the municipal sector, which is the subject of the current complaints; and (iii) the protection of the personnel concerned with respect to trade union rights and collective bargaining. It appends to its response a document from May  entitled  Position of the Ministry of Education regarding the labour situation of education assistants reporting to municipal corporations in the context of the draft act establishing the public education system' (May , Official Gazette No. -).\n.The Government explains that the country s school system is a mixed, public rivate system of provision composed of four types of establishment that report to different entities: municipal (public) establishments, subsidized private establishments, unsubsidized private establishments and establishments with delegated administration. The municipal establishments to which the present case refers are administered by two types of management structure: Municipal Education Administration Departments or Municipal Education Directorates (DAEMs or DEMs), on the one hand, and municipal corporations on the other. DAEMs and DEMs are bodies that belong directly to the municipality; their functions are restricted to the administration of municipal educational establishments, which includes human and pedagogical resource management and administrative management. Municipal corporations are non-profit, private law entities with their own legal personality. Each has a board of directors presided over by the mayor of the respective commune. The general aim of municipal corporations is to administer the education, health and social development of the commune, carrying out functions in different areas of municipal life (education, health, children s services, etc.). On the basis of various studies on the topic, the Government considers that the municipal public education sector is not in a position to permanently ensure terms of administration and resource management that would guarantee the quality, improvement and future protection of public education across the entire country. Accordingly, the proposal contained in the draft act ' which was adopted on  November  (Act No. ) ' envisages the creation of a national system of public education structured around local public education services. These entities belong to the State Administration and assume the form of decentralized public services specialized in education management, which provide administrative, technical and pedagogical support to the school establishments under them. Lastly, the Government declares that it has held a permanent dialogue with almost all stakeholders and unions in school education, in particular, in relation to the draft act establishing the public education system. The unions consulted include the National Council of Education Assistants, the main representative of that segment of workers in municipalized education, which is composed of various federations and confederations of education assistants' associations and unions from the whole Chilean municipal sector (including FENASICOM).\n.Regarding the situation of education assistants (prior to the reform), the Government indicates that they work in one or more educational establishments and carry out functions other than teaching, which might be professional, technical, administrative, auxiliary or service tasks. Education assistants across the municipal sector are governed by Act No.  and also by the Labour Code. The legislation distinguishes their right to association on the basis of the employing entity. For education assistants contracted by DAEMs or DEMs ' i.e. directly by municipalities ' section  of Act No.  establishes that they are subject to Act No.  on civil servants' associations. In the case of municipal corporations, section  of the same Act No.  grants education assistants the right to bargain collectively in accordance with the Labour Code, permitting an exception for this group of workers to the prohibition set out in section  of the Code. According to the Government, the new public education system provided for by the law does not alter the contractual and labour regime of education assistants who work in educational establishments under the authority of municipal corporations or directly for municipalities. In addition, it does not establish requirements or selection processes for transferring all education assistants from municipalities and corporations to future local public education services. The Government asserts that the main modification proposed by the draft act in relation to that sector of workers is to change the employer responsible for contracting education assistants: such employers will assume a single (public) nature, ending the current dichotomy between municipal corporations and municipalities. The Government emphasizes that a key focus of the draft act is ensuring the employment continuity of all workers associated with the provision of public education, meaning that transferred employees will have no break in their employment and will keep their wages and welfare rights. The Government stresses that the  no break in service' transfer model, established in the draft act, means that workers will lose neither their legal rights nor any rights acquired under agreement with the respective municipality or municipal corporation prior to their transfer, including those acquired by tacit agreement. The Government specifies that, in addition to the Administrative Statute, various statutes or specific provisions are applicable to public sector workers according to the nature of their activity. This is true of education assistants, who have their own regulations and statute.\n.Regarding the protection of the union rights of the personnel concerned, the Government states that, firstly, workers have the right to join unions under article () of the national Constitution. However, the legislation on the public sector establishes a relevant exception in article  of the Administrative Statute, which prohibits civil servants from joining or belonging to trade unions in the field of the State Administration. Notwithstanding the above, the Government considers that the State recognizes and respects the freedom of association of State Administration workers, who have their right to form civil servants' associations recognized, the only condition being that they abide by the law and the statutes of the associations, in accordance with Act No.  on civil servants' associations. According to the Government, these associations have, in practice, operated in a similar way to trade unions, meaning that the right to organize of workers has also been respected in the public sector. The Government indicates that freedom of association and the representation of labour interests are exercised differently by public sector workers than by private sector workers, but that that does not mean that the rights do not exist or that there are no mechanisms in place for their enjoyment. Moreover, based on the variant regulations and characteristics of the public employment system, the new Act provides that workers should, pursuant to the reform and the resulting change in labour law, transform their trade unions and form civil servants' associations. The Act grants a period of two years starting from the date of education service transfer for the trade unions representing the transferred personnel to merge, amend their statutes in accordance with Act No.  on civil servants' associations and switch to being governed by such provisions for all legal purposes following the submission of the amended statutes to the Labour Inspectorate. In that regard, the Government underscores that the Act grants existing trade unions the opportunity to adapt to public sector regulations. It thus guarantees that educational assistant workers will not, at any point during the transfer process, be unprotected with respect to their right to organize and right to representation before the authorities and their employer. The Government stresses that trade unions that do not make use of their right to adapt will remain as such and will not lose their legal personality or forego their legal existence in so far as national legislation does not permit the dissolution of unions by a decision of the administrative authority. According to the Government, the reform affects not the trade union rights themselves, but rather the way in which they are guaranteed. Once the assistants become State employees, their right to organize starts being governed by Act No.  establishing regulations on State Administration civil servants' associations. In fact, section (a) of the Act explicitly indicates that one of the main purposes of civil servants' associations will be to promote the advancement of their members' economic, living and working conditions.\n.Regarding the right to bargain collectively, the Government makes a distinction between the right to bargain, on the one hand, and collective bargaining regulated by the Labour Code, on the other. Public sector workers bargain centrally in some cases and on a sectorial basis in others. It is reasonable that general working conditions ' which are established by law ' tend to be"", ""and (iii) there is no recognition of the rights that education workers' trade unions have acquired through collective bargaining.

On that occasion, the Committee made the following recommendations:(a)\tThe Committee again requests the Government to take steps to amend the legislation so that responsibility for declaring a strike illegal does not lie with the Government but with an impartial and independent body.(b)\tFurthermore, the Committee suggests that the disagreements between the parties as to the number and duties of the public service workers in a minimum service should be settled by an independent body, such as, for example, the judicial authority.(c)\tThe Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation concerning the refusal to grant trade union leave to union official Ms Marcela Guevara Gonzlez.\n.The Government submitted additional information in communications dated  April ,  and  September and  November , and  June . Concerning recommendation (a), the Government indicates that: (i) the entity responsible for ruling on the lawfulness of a strike in the private sector is the labour authority, at the national or regional level, in accordance with the rules set out in Supreme Decree No. --TR; and (ii) in accordance with articles ,  and  of the General Regulations of the Civil Service Act No. , rulings on the lawfulness of a strike in the public sector fall within the competence of the Civil Service Support Commission; while the commission will consist of independent professionals, it has not yet been established, hence the Directorate-General of Labour is currently assuming these responsibilities. The Committee notes the information provided by the Government and trusts that the Civil Service Support Commission will be established promptly.\n.Concerning recommendation (b), the Government reports that in , the executive branch issued Supreme Decree No. --TR governing the exercise of the right to strike and the communication of minimum services and the procedure for deviating from them, which was intended to have a positive impact on the determination of minimum services within the enterprise and, in the event that the right to strike is exercised, to provide greater legal certainty both to employers and to workers. The Committee observes that Supreme Decree No.  -TR amends articles  and  of the Regulations of the Collective Labour Relations Act and incorporates articles -A and -B concerning the communication of minimum services in the event of a strike and the procedure for deviating from them. The Committee further observes that the aforementioned articles of the Regulations of the Collective Labour Relations Act were subsequently amended by Supreme Decree No. --TR, which was published on  July , and that article  as amended establishes, inter alia, that: (i) to settle a disagreement on the minimum service level in essential public services, the labour administration may rely on the support of an independent body; and (ii) the labour administration shall settle any disagreements on the basis of the report of the independent body, the technical report submitted by the employer and the observations or reports submitted by the workers or trade union, and may seek the support of the labour inspectorate or other entities. While duly noting the amendments introduced by Supreme Decree No. --TR, the Committee recalls once again that disagreements between the parties as to the number and duties of the workers should not only be examined, but also settled, by an independent body, such as the judicial authority, and trusts that any subsequent amendment will take the foregoing into account.\n.Concerning recommendation (c), the Government informs the Committee that: (i) the State Health Service respects freedom of association and ensures that union leaders' rights and prerogatives are exercised appropriately; and (ii) on  October , Ms Marcela Guevara Gonzlez left her position as Secretary of Social Welfare, Sport and Leisure of the National Union of State Health Service Nurses and does not sit on the current board. The Committee duly notes this information. On the basis of the above considerations, the Committee considers that this case is closed and will not pursue its examination.\n.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Union of State Health Service Nurses (SINESSS) dated  July . The union sent new allegations in a communication dated  November .\n.The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  January .\n.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication dated  July , SINESSS states that the right to strike is recognized in the National Constitution and that on ,  and  May  the launch of a national strike of indefinite duration from  June  was unanimously approved and was duly notified to the Ministry of Labour and Employment Promotion on  May . On  June , the employer (the State Health Service (ESSALUD)) ordered its various administrative bodies, by Circular No. -GC-ESSALUD-, not to recognize the pickets and special working days scheduled by the SINESSS action committees under section  of the Collective Labour Relations Act (Supreme Decree No. --TR), which provides as follows:  When the strike affects essential public services or there is a need to ensure the performance of essential activities, the workers involved in the dispute must guarantee the presence of the necessary staff to prevent a total stoppage and ensure the continuity of services and activities required. On an annual basis and during the first quarter, the enterprises that provide the said essential services shall notify their workers, the trade unions representing them and the labour authority of the number and duties of the workers needed for maintaining the services, hours of work and shifts that they are obliged to perform, and also the intervals at which the respective replacements must be made. The purpose of the present communication is to ensure that the workers or trade unions representing them meet their obligation to provide the respective workforce when the strike takes place.' ,Scraping https://www.ilo.org/dyn/normlex/en/f?p=::::NO::P_COMPLAINT_TEXT_ID:\n.SINESSS states that the employer failed to duly specify the essential areas in accordance with the law and, in view of the due planning of strike pickets by the trade union for the coverage of crucial services, the authority, failing to act in good faith, ordered its directors and administrative managers to undertake the following anti-union activities:(a)\tprovision to be made by chiefs of department and nursing services for external consultations, surgery and general hospital treatment, including minimum services, without due account taken of the fact that those services are not crucial areas or focuses of immediate care whose omission could endanger the lives, health or physical or psychological integrity of patients;(b)\tthe designation of overtime up to a maximum of  hours per month per worker, only in the areas of external consultation, surgery and general hospital treatment; the obligation to work extra hours, RPCT, ordinary hospital shifts of more than six and up to  hours for ordinary staff covered by the / labour regulations.\n.The health administration has thus wilfully and arbitrarily circumvented the administrative competencies of the chiefs of department and duty nurses by obliging union members to provide ordinary services, in total disregard of the fact that the latter only have the legal obligation to provide essential services and not ordinary services such as external consultations, surgery and general hospital treatment.\n.The present decision stemmed from the application of Circular No. -DEGRAR-ESSALUD- (based on Circular No. -GCGP-ESSALUD- applicable to medical and nursing strikes, Executive Decision No. -GC-ESSALUD-), whereby ESSALUD seeks to redefine all areas of ESSALUD activity as crucial areas contrary to the rules established in previous years on the basis of Executive Decision No. -GC-ESSALUD-; in other words, union members have been called upon to be present in their ordinary services without observing the strike pickets.\n.The Second Provincial Prosecutor s Office for Crime Prevention of Lima Judicial District declared that nurses belonging to SINESSS were taking care of crucial areas according to the urgency and gravity of patients' situations.\n.In the abovementioned Circular No. , the ESSALUD administration stated that the management hire duty staff as replacements or through other contractual arrangements such as subcontracting to bridge the labour gap in certain areas. This is a further example of violation of freedom of association inasmuch as the national legislation clearly states in section  of the regulations implementing the General Labour Inspection Act (Supreme Decree No. --TR) that any acts shall be null and void that impede the free exercise of the right to strike, where the aim is to replace workers on strike ' by hiring or scheduling, either direct hire using contracts of unlimited duration or subject to specific conditions, or indirect hire through agencies or via contracting or subcontracting of works or services ' without the authorization of the labour administrative authority.\n.SINESSS adds that it is therefore contradictory that"", ""illegal but also instructing it to take measures such as dismissing the workers who were involved in the stoppage for more than six days. This was despite the fact that the Ministry of Health does not have the status of employer with regard to the CNS, since the latter is owned by the contributing workers and not by the State, least of all the Government.\n.FENSEGURAL indicates that on  April the Government promulgated Supreme Decree No. , which provides that all public health establishments, social security management bodies and other non-profit-making establishments subject to agreements shall, on an exceptional and immediate basis, provide health care to persons affiliated to the CNS. It should be noted that all social security funds took part in the indefinite general strike declared by the COB. The complainant also adds that the CNS, being a health entity, did not stop providing emergency care and different shifts were organized to take part in the demonstrations (one group of workers being mobilized one day while others stayed at work, and vice versa the following day).\n.On  April , another unconstitutional decree (Supreme Decree No. ) was promulgated, stating that in order to guarantee the exceptional regime of the previous decree, the revenue generated by the deductions accruing from the strike ' which was claimed to be illegal ' would be used for the purchase of medical supplies in oncology and paediatrics for the public health system networks. The Ministry of Health has its own budget, which is what it should use for this purpose and not seek to use the workers' money, as provided for by the previous supreme decree.\n.On  April, an agreement was signed between the Government and the COB, to the effect that the strike would be suspended on  April, the decisions reached to be communicated to the authorities so that everything would return to normal in the country. On  May, because of the attempted pay deductions for the strike days and pressure from the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Health, FENSEGURAL and the COB met the CNS authorities. It was explained that while Ministerial Decision No.  issued by the Ministry of Labour declaring the strike to be illegal was being challenged by an appeal and until such time as administrative labour remedies were exhausted, no deductions could be made until a verdict was issued on the matter or it was overturned in favour of the workers. The lawyers and the authorities concurred and the general manager therefore ordered wages to be paid for April without any deductions, pending review by the Ministry of Labour. On  May, the Deputy Health Minister sent a note to the CNS general manager and ordered him to apply Supreme Decree No. , disregarding the document signed by the general manager, violating the managerial and administrative autonomy of the CNS and hinting that dismissals would occur at the CNS.\n.On  May, the financial manager ordered deductions at three-day intervals as from April from all CNS staff, regardless of the fact that many workers had not taken part in the stoppage, such as those on holiday, those working on the night shift in hospitals, those working emergency shifts, kitchen and laundry workers, porters, ambulance drivers for the emergency networks, surgeons and operating theatre staff, and many others including those on sick leave, as well as FENSEGURAL officers on union leave and others belonging to the various social security unions throughout the country.\n.FENSEGURAL considers that the above is clear evidence of violation of the rights established in the Political Constitution and that the agreement between the COB and the Government is broken. FENSEGURAL requests the Committee to send a commission to the country in connection with these facts.\n.In its communication of  June , the FDTFLP alleges the following violations of trade union rights:' Case of Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez from the LAFAR Laboratorios Farmacuticos (pharmaceutical laboratories) enterprise: she was elected general secretary of the LAFAR Industrial Workers' Union from  February  to  February , and was also elected secretary for women s issues and social action from  May  to  May . Despite enjoying the union immunity established by article (VI) of the Political Constitution, she was wrongfully dismissed from her post in June  without regard for section  of the Labour Proceedings Code, which states that until such time as a ruling has been issued removing union immunity, the worker concerned shall remain in his/her post. To date, Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez has received no pay for more than two years, which is a clear violation of the right to organize. The background to the case is attached as evidence.' Case of Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta and Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova from the Wiled SRL Patisu Ltda enterprise: the officers were dismissed wrongfully and without due notice despite their union immunity, as recognized by Ministerial Decision No. / of  March  and Ministerial Decision No. / of  May . Further to the illegal dismissals and the issue of reinstatement orders by the Ministry of Labour, which the enterprise refused to implement, an appeal for amparo (protection of constitutional rights) was filed, having been declared admissible; despite this, however, the enterprise still refuses to reinstate the workers in their posts and in their union activities. To date, Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta and Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova have received no pay and been unable to exercise their union activities for a year, which is a clear violation of the right to organize.' Case of union officers Mr Mario Chipana Mamani, Mr Genaro Espejo Huanca, Mr Ramiro Saire Lliulli and Mr Lucio Apaza Nina of the Novara SRL enterprise: the workers were elected as officers of the Novara SRL Industrial Workers' Union as from February . Despite having this status, they were wrongfully dismissed on  May , their union immunity thus being violated. The Ministry of Labour issued a reinstatement order. However, this public institution does nothing to enforce its decisions, thus failing to discharge its duties. To date, Mr Mario Chipana Mamani, Mr Genaro Espejo Huanca, Mr Ramiro Saire Lliulli and Mr Lucio Apaza Nina have been unable to exercise union activity and have received no pay, which is a clear violation of the right to organize.\n.In its communication of  July , the Government states that the complaint presented by the COB reports the existence of a collective agreement (Panduro agreement) which provides for the possibility of settling collective disputes; however, nowhere does it identify the collective dispute in question, merely stating that there was a failure to comply with the agreement. It is therefore important to make the following clarifications: (a) the underlying basis for the Panduro agreement was the petition to reform the Pensions (Long-Term Insurance) Act, on the basis of contributions from the State and the employers. Honouring and respecting this agreement, the Government decided to set up labour commissions, with the participation of the COB. The discussions were concluded with the promulgation of the Pensions Act (No. ) of  December , in a public ceremony held at the offices of the COB itself, in the presence of the persons who presented the complaint to the International Labour Organization (ILO); and (b) it should be made clear that the Panduro agreement is not a collective labour agreement but a political agreement whereby the Government expresses its willingness to allow the participation of the labour sector in the formulation of preliminary draft legislation. However, this concession should not be construed as the delegation of constitutional powers to labour organizations; it should be made clear that the authority to legislate rests with the legislature of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, in the context of the independence of state bodies, without any interference from the executive authority.\n.The Government adds that its archives and records show that the last set of claims submitted by the COB to the Government was for  and no claims were submitted for ' . The wage increase for  provided for by the Executive of the Plurinational State was authorized under the powers established in article ()(I) of the Political Constitution, in accordance with section (I) of Supreme Decree No.  of  February  concerning the organization of the Executive. For this purpose, annual inflation of . per cent in  was taken into account and Supreme Decree No.  of  March  was issued, which determines a  per cent increase for .\n.Here it should be noted that the fourth point of the Panduro agreement sets out the Government s undertaking not to approve any law that goes against the interests of the labour sectors affiliated to the COB. This wage increase was set at one percentage point above the annual inflation rate, thus setting a real wage increase of benefit to the workers, not to their detriment, as implied by the complaint which was presented; no measures were adopted at any time that involved"", ""pay reductions or freezes or an increase below the rate of inflation.\n.With regard to the strike undertaken by certain sectors affiliated to the COB, the Government states that the action was pursued by a number of workers from two sectors affiliated to the COB (health and education) and certain members of the executive committees concerned. The COB states that the procedures concerning legal strikes established by section  of the General Labour Act had been exhausted, owing to the fact that the collective agreement signed in Panduro in  had allegedly not been honoured by the Government. Here reference should be made to article  of the Political Constitution, which provides that the right to strike is guaranteed as the exercise of the workers' legal entitlement to interrupt work in defence of their rights, in accordance with the law, and also section  of the General Labour Act of  December , which states that any unscheduled stoppage of work in any enterprise by either employers or workers shall be prohibited until all means of conciliation and arbitration provided for under the present title have been exhausted, otherwise the stoppage shall be deemed illegal. Moreover, article (II) of the Political Constitution states that health services shall be provided without interruption, and section  of the General Labour Act adds that the suspension of work in public services shall be prohibited. Any breach of the aforementioned provision shall incur the maximum penalties under the law. The Government indicates that the teachers, CNS workers and public health sector workers took part in the strike in blatant violation of the abovementioned legal provisions.\n.As regards the right to strike, the Government guarantees the exercise thereof under the provisions of the Political Constitution and the General Labour Act. A strike represents an extreme course of action called for by a trade union when it has been unable to settle a dispute by means of conciliation or arbitration and involves a peaceful suspension of work; however, the violent mobilization instigated by the workers concerned violated the provisions of section  of the General Labour Act, which states that the concept of the strike means the peaceful suspension of work and any hostile act or demonstration against persons or property shall incur criminal penalties. In this context, the supreme task of the Government is to guarantee the fundamental right to education, health and work as provided for in articles () and (I) of the Political Constitution.\n.As regards the allegation that the workers were the victims of brutality by the repressive apparatus of the State, were tear-gassed, illegally detained, subjected to criminal trials and harassed constantly by government officials, their trade union immunity thus being violated, the Government wishes to make it clear that the Plurinational State of Bolivia, by constitutional mandate, does not have a repressive apparatus but legally established defence and protection institutions. Article (I) of the Political Constitution states that the Bolivian police, as a public force, has the specific mission to defend society, preserve public order and enforce the law throughout the national territory. In this case it acted accordingly, protecting public safety, private and public property, the institutional heritage of the State and the national emblems.\n.The Government adds that trade union immunity represents a constitutional guarantee conferred on union officers, in accordance with article () of the Political Constitution, Legislative Decree No.  (raised to the status of Act No.  of  February ) and Supreme Decree No.  of  May . Hence the Government has never disregarded the fundamental right of union immunity. On the contrary, it protects and guarantees it. All in all, the complaint lacks any factual or legal basis; the fulfilment of a constitutional mandate in response to events that violate the most basic principles such as social peace and respect for the state of law cannot be deemed a violation of trade union immunity.\n.Finally, the COB states in its document that as a continuation of the direct negotiation procedure an eight-point agreement was signed on  April  at the Office of the Vice-President of the Plurinational State and it claims that the agreement was not honoured, inasmuch as Supreme Decree No.  of  August  was not repealed. It is important to note that the second point of the agreement between the Government and the COB states that a Supreme Decree will be drafted by both parties for promulgation on  May, providing for the definitive elimination of Supreme Decree No. . Thus Supreme Decree No.  was issued on the said date,  providing for the complete elimination of any legal provision or consideration established by Supreme Decree No. '  with the further establishment of a high-level commission representing both the Executive and the COB.\n.The Ministry of Education, in order to guarantee the continuity and regularity of educational activities and the quality of the education service, in accordance with section  of Supreme Decree No.  of  February , which established education as a public service whose continuity and regularity is essential for the achievement of quality objectives, determined that any stoppages, strikes or unjustified absences would not be entitled to remuneration under the public education service regulations. Accordingly, with the exception of unionized teachers on union leave, teachers were guaranteed to be paid for days actually worked, on the basis of the procedure established in Ministry Decision No. / of  April , according to reports written by the departmental and district education directorates which were forwarded to the staff management unit of the Plurinational Education Service attached to the Ministry of Education.\n.Finally, the Government emphasizes that the Plurinational State of Bolivia, in the context of ratified international instruments for the protection of the right to work, guarantees freedom of association at all levels, and also unions' right to the free exercise of functions assigned under the Political Constitution for the defence of workers' interests.\n.In its communication of  September , the Government makes the following statement in relation to the allegations presented by the FDTFLP:()\tCase of Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez from the LAFAR Laboratorios Farmacuticos enterprise: further to checks in the systems and archives regarding claims of violation of trade union immunity, no record was found of the complaint made by Ms Fidelia Flores Gmez regarding union immunity but only a  first summons regarding an occupational accident and a pay reduction'  Hence, there is no evidence of presentation of the formal complaint to the Ministry of Labour.()\tCase of Mr Hilder Alarcn Mayta and Mr Marco Antonio Herbas Crdova from the Wiled SRL Patisu Ltda enterprise: the Ministry of Labour issued the corresponding reinstatement order to Wiled SRL Patisu Ltda, failure to implement which would incur the corresponding penalty and result in the Labour and Social Security Court being informed.()\tCase of Mr Mario Chipana Mamani, Mr Genaro Espejo Huanca, Mr Ramiro Saire Lliulli and Mr Lucio Apaza Nina of the Novara SRL enterprise: given the violation of union immunity, the Ministry of Labour will issue the corresponding reinstatement order to Novara SRL, failure to implement which would incur the corresponding penalty and result in the Labour and Social Security Court being informed.\n.The Government wishes to point out that the Plurinational State of Bolivia does not have any sort of complicity with private enterprise; rather, the Ministry of Labour is an institution which is unyielding in the defence and protection of workers' constitutionally established social and labour rights, as expressed by the Political Constitution of the Plurinational State of Bolivia. Trade union immunity is a constitutional guarantee conferred on union officers. The Ministry of Labour has acted in accordance with the labour legislation in force and has followed all due procedures for the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and union officers, bearing in mind that under paragraph IV of Supreme Decree No.  and Ministerial Decision No. / the workers have filed for constitutional amparo.\n.As regards the allegations made by the FENSEGURAL, the Government makes the following statement:()\tAs regards the opening of fiscal accounts: section  of Finance Act No.  of  November  establishes that the social security funds must open fiscal accounts authorized by the Deputy Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs; in addition, section  of Regulatory Decree No.  of  January  establishes that the social security funds must open their fiscal accounts at the Banco Unin within  days. At no time did the Government seek to confiscate the financial resources of the social security funds; the only intention was to enforce Finance Act No. , inasmuch as the CNS and the other funds are public bodies which are subject to the law like any other institutions.()\tAs regards the indefinite general strike of the CNS: the request from the COB to repeal section  of Finance Act No.  and section  of Regulatory Decree No.  was inappropriate, since laws are not subject to negotiation but necessitate compliance. Accordingly, article  of the Political Constitution provides that the right to strike""]"

In this regard, the Committee recalls that the right to life is a fundamental prerequisite for the exercise of the rights contained in Convention No.  (ratified by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) [see Compilation of decisions of the Committee on Freedom of Association, sixth edition, , para. ]. The Committee also recalls that the killing, disappearance or serious injury of trade union leaders and trade unionists requires the institution of independent judicial inquiries in order to shed full light, at the earliest date, on the facts and the circumstances in which such actions occurred and in this way, to the extent possible, determine where responsibilities lie, punish the guilty parties and prevent the repetition of similar events [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee deeply deplores the killing of Mr Jimnez and urges the Government to take the necessary steps to ensure that the competent authorities: (i) give priority to the investigations under way and make every effort necessary to identify as quickly as possible the perpetrators and instigators of the killing of Mr Jimnez and ensure that the corresponding penalties are imposed on them; and (ii) take full account in the investigations of all relevant elements relating to the trade union activity of Mr Jimnez. The Committee requests the Government to provide information soon on progress made in this respect.\n.The Committee notes the allegations made by UNETE concerning persecution, intimidation and harassment of trade union leaders. With regard to the alleged persecution by state security forces of Mr Reynaldo Daz, general secretary of the Union of Electricians and Allied Workers of the Capital District and Miranda State, the Committee notes that the Government denies that the alleged events occurred and asserts that Mr Daz has the full use and exercise of his legal and trade union powers and that there is no arrest warrant or investigation against him. The Committee also notes the allegations of persecution, harassment and suspension of the payment of wages of Ms Norma Torres, administration and finance secretary of the Union of Electricians and Allied Workers of Carabobo State. In this regard, the Committee notes the Government s statement that there has not been any harassment or persecution and that it has forwarded the information provided by the enterprise employing Ms Torres, which indicates that: (i) it denies these allegations; (ii) Ms Torres did not appear for work for over nine months; (iii) Ms Torres does not have indefinite union leave and has refused to return to her job, and so if wages have been deducted, it is because of her absenteeism; and (iv) it applied for an authorization of dismissal to the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour; this has nothing to do with the union activities of Ms Torres but with her absenteeism. The Committee observes major divergences between the assertions contained in the complaint and the Government s reply with respect to the cases of Mr Daz and Ms Torres. In view of these divergences, the Committee invites UNETE to provide further details regarding the allegation of persecution and harassment of the above-mentioned trade union leaders so that this issue can be examined in full knowledge of the facts and, if this is not possible, to indicate whether there is any obstacle to providing this information; and it requests the Government to send further information regarding the procedure initiated with the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour against Ms Torres.\n.The Committee notes UNETE s allegations regarding persecution and harassment that it faced on  September , denouncing the violent intrusion of four presumed officials of the DGCIM, one of them armed, with the intention of preventing a press conference attended by family members and lawyers of imprisoned workers. In this regard, the Committee recalls that freedom of opinion and expression and, in particular, the right not to be penalized for one s opinions, is an essential corollary of freedom of association, and workers, employers and their organizations should enjoy freedom of opinion and expression in their meetings, publications and in the course of their trade union activities [see Compilation, para. ]. The Committee also recalls that the rights of workers' and employers' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against the leaders and members of these organizations, and it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected [see Compilation, para. ]. Observing that the Government has still not responded to this allegation, the Committee requests the Government to provide its observations on this matter as quickly as possible.\n.The Committee notes the allegations made by the CTV denouncing the arbitrary detention and irregular criminal prosecution of Mr Eudis Felipe Girot, executive director of the United Federation of Petroleum Workers of Venezuela (FUTPV). The Committee notes that the CTV alleges that: (i) at  p.m. on  November , DGCIM officials arrested Mr Girot on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by the Third Special Criminal Court of First Instance for Control Functions, which has competence to deal with crimes related to terrorism ( November ); (ii) further to the initial court hearing in Caracas, the court dismissed some of the charges but upheld the charges of terrorism and association with organized crime (sections  and  of the Basic Act against organized crime and funding of terrorism); (iii) the crimes to which the charges relate are subject to penalties of imprisonment ranging from  to  years; and (iv) the court issued a precautionary measure of  days in custody. The Committee notes the CTV s allegation that the detention is related to Mr Girot s activities as a trade union leader (he has led two national protests demanding that benefits established by contract should be honoured and has received support from petroleum workers in other states). The Committee notes that the Government has not provided its response to this allegation. However, the Committee observes that the CEACR, in its recent comment on the application of Convention No.  (published in ), noted the information received by the Government regarding the case of Mr Eudis Girot, including the fact that: (i) by means of a court judgment, Mr Girot was acquitted of the crime of disclosure of confidential information (section  of the Penal Code) and illicit possession of a firearm (section  of the Basic Act concerning disarmament and the control of arms and munitions); (ii) he was convicted of the crime of fomenting hatred (section  of the Penal Code) and sentenced to three years' imprisonment and in this regard the non-custodial precautionary measure was maintained; (iii) the proceedings are at the appeals stage and if the judgment is upheld, the competent court will impose alternative formulas for serving the sentence, in accordance with the Basic Code of Criminal Procedure. The Committee notes the CTV s indication that various international organizations have identified patterns with regard to persecution and prosecution of trade unionists in the country. The Committee notes the CTV s allegation that, in the case of Mr Girot, a pattern is being repeated of proceedings being held in a court far from the home of the accused, thereby exposing him to isolation from family and friends and depriving him of assistance, even in the form of food and medicine.\n.The Committee duly notes these serious allegations and recalls that the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights; the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organizations must be based on respect for those civil liberties, such as security of the person and freedom from arbitrary arrest and detention, and that measures designed to deprive trade union leaders and members of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association [see Compilation, paras  and ]. The Committee observes that, in a similar vein, the Commission of Inquiry appointed under article  of the ILO Constitution to examine the observance by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), Convention No.  and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), recommended: ' ii) cessation of the use of judicial proceedings and preventive and non-custodial measures, including the subjection of civilians to military jurisdiction, (' ; (iii) the immediate release of any employer or trade unionist who is imprisoned in relation to the exercise of the legitimate activities of their organizations  ?(report of the Commission of Inquiry, para. ()(ii) and (iii)). The Committee urges the Government to provide detailed information on the situation of Mr Girot, and urges the Government to ensure that due process is respected in criminal proceedings against him, and"", "".The complaint is contained in a communication of  June  presented under article  of the ILO Constitution by several delegates to the th Session () of the International Labour Conference. The Governing Body decided at its th Session (March ) that all allegations of the complaint concerning Convention No.  should be transmitted to the Committee on Freedom of Association for their examination.\n.The complainant organizations presented additional information in communications dated  March ,  December ,  January ,  and  February  and  September . In addition, the National Union of Workers of Venezuela (UNETE) submitted additional allegations and information in communications dated  February . The National Federation of Labour Unions of Higher Education of Venezuela (FENASOESV) submitted further allegations by communication of  February .\n.The Government sent its observations in various communications dated  September ,  January  and  October .\n.The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.UNETE denounces the killing of Mr Ramn Jimnez, general secretary of the Construction Union of Barinas State, on  April . UNETE also denounces acts of persecution by state security forces against Mr Reynaldo Daz, general secretary of the Union of Electricians and Allied Workers of the Capital District and Miranda State. UNETE further denounces acts of persecution and harassment and suspension of the payment of wages of Ms Norma Torres, administration and finance secretary of the Union of Electricians and Allied Workers of Carabobo State.\n.UNETE alleges in its communication of  February  the anti-union dismissal of Mr Alejandro lvarez Aular, general secretary of the Union of Workers of the National Steel Enterprise (SIDERNAC), a union affiliated to UNETE. Specifically, UNETE reports that Mr lvarez Aular, in the exercise of his trade union functions, denounced to the Labour Inspectorate of Puerto Ordaz on  January  various violations of labour rights at a steel enterprise in the public sector in which he worked as plant protection supervisor, with  years of service. The complainants indicate that following the denunciation, managerial and supervisory staff of the public enterprise informed Mr lvarez that  on the instructions of the president of the enterprise ' he could no longer do his usual rounds of the enterprise installations ' involving contact with the workers'  The complainants indicate that doing these rounds of the enterprise installations were part of the trade union functions of Mr lvarez. Subsequently, the enterprise security staff instructed him to leave the plant, denied him entry and told him that he should not resist as officials from the Directorate-General of Military Counter-Intelligence (DGCIM) were on the enterprise premises and were hoping for some reaction from him so as to be able to arrest him. The complainants indicate that as follow-up Mr lvarez submitted a new official letter to the Labour Inspectorate of Puerto Ordaz on  January  to denounce the above-mentioned events.\n.UNETE indicates that the same measure was applied on the following day to Mr Arjonio Farrera, who was also working at the enterprise and held the post of labour and complaints secretary of SIDERNAC. The complainants denounce the fact that  other workers were dismissed by the same public enterprise. The complainants allege that the above-mentioned acts not only violate the national legislation and international conventions relating to freedom of association but are also contrary to the decree published on  December  in Official Gazette No. ., protecting public and private workers against dismissal for a further two years. In this regard, UNETE alleges that the general secretary of SIDERNAC followed up on the above-mentioned events with the submission of official letters on  January  to: (i) the office of the Director-General of the DGCIM for the Guyana Region, in order to request a meeting with the union s executive committee to seek an explanation for the visits of DGCIM groups and armed units to the public steel enterprise; and (ii) the Labour Inspectorate of Puerto Ordaz, in order to denounce violations of the above-mentioned decree and other applicable legislation relating to protection against dismissal.\n.By a communication of  September , UNETE alleges new acts of persecution and harassment against it, in particular the violent intrusion on  September  of four presumed DGCIM officials, one of whom was armed, to prevent the holding of a press conference attended by family members and lawyers of imprisoned workers. In this communication UNETE asked that several appendices sent to various authorities be considered as part of the complaint, namely: (i) a letter sent to the members of the Credentials Committee at the th Session of the International Labour Conference ( May ) to object to the delegation nominated by the Government; (ii) a letter to the ILO Director-General ( June ), which includes an account of the background to the social dialogue forum, as well as other events that occurred at the time of the forum; and (iii) a letter sent to the Deputy Minister for the Integrated Labour Inspection and Social Security System regarding consultation on special laws complementing or deriving from the Basic Act on Labour and Workers.\n.UNETE alleges that the Government has been implementing a systematic policy of violations of freedom of association, including anti-union reprisals and violations of collective bargaining. UNETE adds that these allegations have been examined in the context of various complaints to the Committee (in particular Cases Nos , , , , , , , , ,  and ) and by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations (CEACR).\n.Furthermore, the CTV, on behalf of and representing the Single Union of Petroleum, Chemical and Allied Workers and Employees of the Autonomous Municipalities of Bruzual, Pealver, Bolvar, Libertad and Sotillo of Anzotegui State, alleges the arbitrary detention and irregular criminal prosecution of Mr Eudis Felipe Girot, executive director of the United Federation of Petroleum Workers (FUTPV). The CTV alleges that at  p.m. on  November  DGCIM officials arrested Mr Girot on the basis of an arrest warrant dated  November  issued by the Third Special Criminal Court of First Instance for Control Functions, which has competence to deal with crimes related to terrorism. The CTV alleges that Mr Girot was transferred to the headquarters of the DGCIM in Pozuelos in Sotillo Municipality in Anzotegui State and then to Caracas. The CTV alleges that Mr Girot was charged with the crimes of terrorism, association with organized crime (sections  and  of the Basic Act against organized crime and funding of terrorism), disclosure of confidential information and conspiracy (sections  and  of the Penal Code). The CTV adds that, at the corresponding hearing, the court dismissed the charges of disclosure of confidential information and conspiracy but upheld the charges of terrorism and association with organized crime, issuing a precautionary measure of  days in custody in Caracas.\n.The CTV maintains that Mr Girot is a recognized trade union leader in the petroleum sector who has led two national protests demanding that benefits established by contract should be honoured and has received support from petroleum workers in other states. The CTV therefore alleges that the deprivation of freedom and criminal prosecution of Mr Girot stem from his complaints concerning workers' conditions of employment in the petroleum industry and the status of his employer. The CTV adds that the crimes with which Mr Girot has been charged are subject to penalties of imprisonment ranging from  to  years. The CTV points out that the report of the Commission of Inquiry established under article  of the ILO Constitution to examine the observance by the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela of the Minimum Wage-Fixing Machinery Convention,  (No. ), the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Tripartite Consultation (International Labour Standards) Convention,  (No. ), indicates that trade unionists are being persecuted and prosecuted in the country, and the CTV quotes paragraph  of the report:  [T]he Commission considers that: (i) the bringing of criminal charges such as terrorism and treason against leaders of professional associations and trade unionists in relation to their trade union activities; [  and (iv) the continuation of criminal proceedings for years, with the imposition of probationary measures on the leaders, constitute serious violations of the civil liberties inherent to freedom of association and contribute greatly to the repression and hindering of that freedom, and confirm the perception examined earlier in the report that the exercise of trade union activities constitutes a high-risk activity in the country.' The CTV also asserts that the independent international fact-finding mission on the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, appointed by the United Nations Human Rights Council (September , A/HRC//), highlighted the fact that criminal prosecution by judges and prosecutors without any independence whatsoever, and with the frequent intervention of intelligence agencies,"", ""of Venezuela has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In its communication of  January , the CTV alleges that Decree No. , dated  December , was published in Official Gazette No.  of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, of  December , which created the  Presidential Commission for the Creation and Drafting of the new Basic Labour Act'  This Commission, in addition to being exclusive and closed, failed to include the CTV, the most representative trade union organization of Venezuelan workers. All of the members of the Commission (section  of the Decree) are representatives or persons tied to official circles in one way or another (ministers, the Attorney-General of the Republic, the President of a Bolivarian Socialist Central Organization of City, Rural and Maritime Workers, appointed personally and without election and who is part of a trade union bureaucracy designated by the President of the Republic, the President of a federation of employers (FEDEINDUSTRIA), magistrates of the Supreme Court of Justice, certain labour experts, deputies in the National Assembly, and representatives of official circles). However, there was no representation of the real social partners who, in a democratic society, should be included, particularly when a new Basic Labour Act is to be discussed and drawn up to regulate labour relations in the country.\n.The CTV, nevertheless, observes that articles () and () of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela provide for the prohibition of any type of discrimination on grounds of politics, age, race, sex, belief or any other condition. Furthermore, recognition of the principle of tripartite consultation set out in ILO Convention No.  requires the Venezuelan State, in accordance with Article (),  to operate procedures which ensure effective consultations ' between representatives of the government, of employers and of workers'  The CTV suffered discrimination by not being represented on the Presidential Commission for the drafting of the new Basic Labour Act. There was also discrimination against other pluralist and democratic trade union confederations in the country. All of this is in violation of Conventions Nos  and , particularly taking into account that under the terms of section () of the Decree, the Presidential Commission for the Creation and Drafting of the new Basic Labour Act shall include in its functions:  reviewing the current situation with regard to social benefits, rest periods, the working day, stability and the trial period, subcontracting, trade union membership and collective agreements, as well as any other area of labour regulation that it is necessary to adapt to the paradigms of a social State of law and justice, as well as proposing the establishment of new social institutions which dignify the condition of labour as an element of society' \n.Furthermore, in the third and fourth preambular paragraphs of the Decree, reference is made to the construction of a socialist foundation and a workers' socialist government, which is in violation of article  of the Constitution respecting economic freedom and the role of the State. Finally, it was decided that the new Act would not be adopted through the ordinary legislative procedures, but through an enabling act of the Legislative Assembly in favour of the President of the Republic.\n.In its communications dated  May  and  November , the APUCV alleges that the new Basic Act on Labour and Workers (LOTTT) is in violation of freedom of association. The Act was adopted by a Decree of the President of the Republic without any dialogue being held with the representative organizations of workers and employers, with the exception of the recently created and official  Socialist Central Organization of City, Rural and Maritime Workers'  In the end, a legal text was imposed in which the exclusive ideological position of the governing party is visible to the detriment of the plurality of ideas existing among Venezuelan workers.\n.Moreover, in the Decree, the Government has ignored the recommendations made by the supervisory bodies of the ILO, which urged it to amend the legislation to bring it into line with the provisions of Conventions Nos  and , on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, in consultation with the representative organizations of workers and employers. The reports of the Committee on the Application of Standards of the International Labour Conference record the repeated occasions on which the National Government has undertaken to comply with these recommendations. Nevertheless: () it failed to hold consultations and dialogue with the representative trade union organizations of Venezuelan workers, which are distinct from official organizations; () in open violation of the Constitution of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, it refused to allow the LOTTT to be discussed and approved by the National Assembly, which is the competent body for the adoption of laws; and () a brief review of the content of the chapter of the LOTTT on freedom of association shows that its rules are incompatible with Convention No.  on freedom of association.\n.In this respect, the APUCV alleges that in the regulations set out in the LOTTT, the ideological aspects of certain rules give rise to serious uncertainties concerning trade union activity, since trade unions are assigned responsibilities which are those of the State. By way of example, section () and () respecting the attributions and objectives of trade unions, reads as follows:Section . Trade union organizations of workers shall have the following attributions and objectives:.\t[ .\tContributing to the production and distribution of goods and services for the satisfaction of the needs of the people..\tExercising control and vigilance over costs and earnings, so that the prices of the goods and services produced are just for the people.\n.In the view of the APUCV, such obligations are completely inconsistent with ILO Convention No. , which provides that trade union organizations shall be free to determine their programmes of action and the State shall refrain from any interference which limits this right. Furthermore, it is also the case that if a trade union does not fulfil the mandate set out in section , the Government will refuse to register it, as indicated in section () of the LOTTT:Section . The National Registrar of Trade Union Organizations may refuse to register a trade union in the following cases:.\tIf the trade union does not have as its objective the attributions and objectives envisaged in this Act.\n.With regard to the right of organizations to draw up their rules and to elect their representatives in full freedom, the APUCV alleges that: () trade unions are required to set out in their by-laws the  replacement' of the members of their executive boards (sections  and  of the LOTTT) and  a system of balloting which includes the election of the executive board by a single vote and the proportional representation of minorities' (section (e)); () despite the reduction in the powers of the National Electoral Council (CNE) in trade union elections, there remain serious doubts concerning the purpose of the notification that has to be made by trade unions to the CNE when they decide to hold elections (section  of the LOTTT); () in clear contravention of the rights envisaged in Convention No. , trade union leaders are required to submit a  sworn declaration of property' to a state body, the Office of the Comptroller-General of the Republic. This requirement, which exists in the country only for persons who are public officials or who administer public property, undermines the private nature of trade union organizations and their assets: in other words, the basis is being established to qualify trade unions as legal persons in public law, subject to the control of the State; moreover the possibility for the controller to carry out audits of trade union accounts is also envisaged (sections ' ); and () section  of the transitional provision of the LOTTT requires trade union organizations to  adapt their by-laws' to the Act  before  December ' \n.In its communication of  November , the APUCV indicates that the Presidential Decree approved the provisions that are in violation of freedom of association which had been noted with concern for years by the supervisory bodies, and particularly the Committee on Freedom of Association, and set out new rules which may also be contrary to freedom of association, as described below.\n.The Legislative Decree explicitly lays down, in contradiction with the recommendations of the ILO supervisory bodies:(a)\tThe  electoral abeyance' of trade unions, and particularly their leaders (sections , , , , () and ()). In accordance with these sections, the members of the executive board of a trade union have to be elected for a maximum period of three years (for unions and federations) or five years (confederations and central organizations). If this period elapses without new elections being held, the leaders automatically remain  in abeyance' and, as a result, can only carry out simple acts of administration""]"

(Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.\n.It should be borne in mind that complaints have been coming before the Committee in connection with this case since October . In the years immediately following the change of regime in August , the Committee was called upon to examine allegations relating to the closing down by order of the Government of the Bolivian Central of Workers (COB), the Bolivian Miners\' Trade Union Federation (FSTMB) and the La Paz Central of Workers, the takeover of the Bolivian National Urban Schoolteachers\' Federation, and the arrest or banishment of trade unionists. In more recent years, the allegations have been concerned more particularly with the decrees adopted in November  involving major restrictions on trade union rights in all branches of the economy and with the trade union situation in the mining industry. Two direct contacts missions have been carried out in Bolivia - from  March to  April  and from - July  - by a representative of the Director-General.\n.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of the Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour coordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers\' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students\' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lock-outs and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour coordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a Labour Code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.\n.Furthermore, the complaint filed under article  of the Constitution of the ILO referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.\n.A special national Committee drafted a new Labour Code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. According to the Government, the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO\'s opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government stated that it had taken a number of steps pending the adoption of the new legislation. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers\' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers\' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.\n.In a communication of  October , the Government referred to a speech made on  July  by the President of the Republic before the Supreme Court. He stated that the Government was preparing for Bolivia\'s return to a Constitutional regime. Since this would have to be preceded by what might be termed an institutionalisation phase, the people would be consulted with a view to introducing into the national Constitution amendments reflecting the new realities in the country and the prospects opening up as a result. Once these reforms had been approved by the people, continued the Head of State, Constitutional government would be restored. The Government added that the adoption and implementation of new trade union legislation were comprised in the measures to be adopted as part of the process leading up to the country\'s return to a Constitutional regime.\n.In November , the Committee had expressed its deep concern at the slowness of the progress toward the restoration of a normal trade union situation in the country; the legislation announced had still not been adopted and the restrictions on the exercise of trade union activities were still in force. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body had expressed its regret that, notwithstanding the time which had elapsed, the principles and standards of freedom of association freely subscribed by Bolivia were still not observed in the country and had appealed to the Government to re-establish as a matter of urgency, both in law and in practice, the conditions indispensable to the carrying on of normal trade union activities in Bolivia.\n.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee had examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . In November , the Committee had reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body had urged the Government to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the list of persons dismissed and the re-opening of the miners\' broadcasting stations and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers\' and miners\' leaders who were still imprisoned or exiled. The Committee and the Governing Body had examined the action taken on these recommendations on several occasions. In particular, at its November  Session the Governing Body, while noting with interest the release of a certain number of mineworkers, had urged the Government to continue its review of the situation of the other workers\' and miners\' leaders who were still under arrest or in exile. The Governing Body had also requested the Government to ensure the rapid return of the miners\' radio stations to the workers.\n.In broader terms, the Governing Body had suggested that the Government envisage the possibility of granting an amnesty to the other trade union leaders in exile.\n.In a letter which the Committee received just before its November  Session, the COB alleged that the Government was preventing workers who had been released from prison or had returned from exile from returning to work in the mines. Their names were in fact on black-lists which were discreetly circulated among the senior officials of the government institutions and state and private enterprises so that they should not be given any work. The COB also gave the names of several trade unionists and union leaders who had been arrested: Armando Morales, an official of the Miners\' Federation, Flavio Villar, a union leader in the manufacturing industry, and Mario Carrasco, Arns, Quispe, Tola and Alarcn, trade unionists.\n.The representative of the Bolivian Government had made various statements regarding the development of the trade union situation to the November  Session of the Governing Body. In a communication dated  January , the Government clarified and amplified these statements with the following information:- general elections are to be held in July ;- a general amnesty was decreed on  January ; all persons under arrest for political reasons were released immediately and those in exile have been allowed to return to the country;- consultations were held on the draft Labour Code with the employers\' and workers\' organisations, a procedure necessary for its adoption;- Decree No. , of  January  restores the right of association as from  January ;- effective steps have been taken to ensure that the dismissed miners are reinstated in their jobs.\n.Decree No. , mentioned above provides for the renewal of the executive Committees of the trade union organisations in accordance with the legislation currently in force and with their by-laws, within  days for first-degree unions,  days in the case of departmental federations and within  days in the case of national federations and Confederations. Matters of interpretation or procedure that may arise during this transitional period are to be resolved in each case by means of an agreement between the competent authorities and the representative of the existing trade union federation in accordance with the legislative provisions currently in', '.The Committee has already examined allegations relating to the years immediately following the change of regime on  August  (closing down of the COB, the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers and the FSTMB; takeover of the National Urban Schoolteachers\' Federation; arrest and banishment of trade unionists). It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners\' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.\n.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers\' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students\' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.\n.The complaint filed under article  of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.\n.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. In April , the Government stated that the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO\'s opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government had also sought the views of certain employers\' and workers\' representatives, but considered that a more thorough analysis would need to be made by all the employers\' and workers\' sectors involved. It therefore had plans for consultations to take place before the new legislation was adopted. Nevertheless, not wishing to create a vacuum during this interim period, the Government had taken a series of measures. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers\' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. This had been done mainly in the following sectors: mines, railways, telecommunications, electric light and power, telephones and airports. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers\' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.\n.In May  the Committee noted in particular that the Labour Code, and especially its provisions as regards trade unions, had still not been adopted. In consequence the Governing Body, on the Committee\'s recommendation, urged the Government to do everything possible to expedite the adoption and application of the new trade union legislation.\n.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee has examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . According to the complainants, wage claims presented again following the XVIth National Mineworkers\' Congress (May ), and a strike that was planned if these demands were not satisfied, had provided the Government with an opportunity to represent the action not as an economic claim by the workers, but as a political manoeuvre. Consequently, before the strike had been declared in support of the workers\' demands, the armed forces had occupied most of the mining sectors and a series of repressive measures - including the closing down of the FSTMB and of local trade unions in mining areas, the occupation of the miners\' radio stations and the arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade union officials and workers - had been taken against the workers and their leaders. The Government argued that it was really a question of political and even subversive activities by leaders in the mines and other sectors, which had been made to look like action in support of economic claims. The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners\' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.\n.In November  the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts, but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners\' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.\n.In February  the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No.  of  December , whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.\n.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April , the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations.

The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed in this respect.\n.The complaint is contained in communications of  May ,  February and  August , submitted by the Trade Union Association of Agricultural and Rural Workers (ASTAC) and the Trade Union Association of the fruit company Compaa Frutas Selectas SA FRUTSESA.\n.The Government submitted its observations in communications of  February,  October and  December .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), and the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention,  (No. ).\n.In their various communications, the complainants allege, first, that in violation of ILO Conventions Nos , ,  and , which have been ratified by Ecuador, the labour administration refused to register ASTAC. In this connection, the complainants contend, in particular, that: (i) on  February ,  workers from the banana agro-industry held a meeting in Quevedo, Los Ros Province, in order to found ASTAC; (ii) on  July , ASTAC lodged its registration application with the Regional Directorate of Labour in Guayaquil, duly supported by the documentation required by section  of the Labour Code; (iii) on  October , a resolution of the Deputy Minister of Labour refused to recognize the setting up of ASTAC; (iv) the labour administration s decision rested on the finding that the workers who had attended ASTAC s constituent assembly were employed by a variety of companies, that the documents which had been submitted did not refer to any employer in particular and that the applicants therefore wished to set up an independent association without them having any dependent employment relationship, in breach of the procedures laid down in sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code; (v) on  April , the Ministry of Labour, basing its decision on the same grounds, rejected the extraordinary appeal for review filed against the resolution refusing to recognize the founding of the trade union; and (vi) on  February , the Quevedo Court of Justice found that the lawsuit seeking protection against a denial of freedom of association brought by the nascent trade union against the Minister of Labour was inadmissible on grounds of lack of territorial jurisdiction. In this connection, the complainant holds that the Quevedo Court of Justice infringed both the Basic Act on jurisdictional guarantees and constitutional review, and the Constitution which recognize that  the court of the place where the act or omission arose, or where it produces its effects, shall be competent' \n.The complainants add that the refusal to recognize the establishment of a banana plantation workers' trade union covering workers from various companies in the sector prevents more than , banana plantation workers from exercising their trade union rights, since within the country there are more than , small banana plantations which employ fewer than  workers, the minimum number required by the Labour Code for setting up a trade union. The complainants further submit that, in plantations which employ a sufficient number of workers for the lawful founding of a trade union, the employers often tend to retaliate if a trade union is formed, as is demonstrated by the second allegation in the present complaint, this being all the more reason not to forbid the founding of a trade union organization in the banana sector. Lastly, the complainants hold that, in other areas, the Ministry of Labour recognizes the soundness of the sectoral trade union model, as is demonstrated by the registration of the National Union of Remunerated Domestic Workers (SINUTRHE) on  June .\n.Secondly, the complainants allege that the members and leaders of the  February Association of Banana Plantation Workers of the Enterprise Frutas Selectas SA Frutsesa (hereinafter  the company trade union'  are being targeted by a number of anti-union acts aimed at preventing the registration and securing the disappearance of this nascent trade union. In this connection, the complainants state in particular that: (i) the constituent assembly of the company trade union took place on  June  and was attended by  workers, as attested by their signature; (ii) on  August , Mr Luis Ochoa, the general secretary, submitted an application for the registration of the company union to the Regional Directorate of Labour of Guayas Province; (iii) on  October , the Provincial Labour Inspector of Guayas notified the banana company of the receipt of the trade union s application for registration; (iv) on  October , the Regional Directorate of Labour of Guayaquil received the sworn testimony of five workers who stated that they had not taken part in the company trade union s constituent assembly and that they did not wish to become members thereof, although their names were on the founding document; (v) as from  October , the company began to dismiss trade union leaders and members who had not signed sworn statements, including the organization s general secretary, Mr Luis Ochoa; (vi) on  and  October  the Regional Directorate of Labour of Guayaquil received an additional three and four sworn statements, with identical wording to that of the statements received on  October ; (vii) in breach of the law, the notary did not read out the text of the these statements to the workers who were pressurized into signing them; (viii) on  October , the banana company s legal representative filed an appeal against the proceedings to establish the trade union with the Regional Directorate of Labour, in which he argued that  of the  founding members of the trade union had never been company employees and that two other persons had terminated their employment relationship with the company prior to the founding of the trade union; (ix) on  November , a resolution of the Deputy Minister of Labour refused to recognize the founding of the company union on the grounds that it lacked the minimum number of members required by the Labour Code; (x) the resolution expressly stated that, on checking with the company, it had been ascertained that of the  persons who had allegedly been founding members only  were company workers at the time the trade union was set up and that of these  persons,  had presented a sworn statement denying that they had participated in the founding of the trade union; and (xi) on  May , Mr Luis Ochoa filed a criminal complaint against Mr Tito Gentillini, the company s representative, alleging intimidation, on the grounds that on  and  May  he had received telephone calls and text messages containing threats of physical violence should he continue to remain in contact with company employees who had not yet been dismissed. Finally, the complainants contend that, notwithstanding the dismissal of and threats against the company s trade union s leaders, no public authority had taken a stand to protect the workers.\n.In its communication of  February , the Government states, with reference to the Ministry of Labour s refusal to register ASTAC, that the Ministry s decision was based on the correct application of the provisions of the Labour Code. In particular, the Government contends that: (i) section  of the Labour Code requires at least  workers for the founding of a trade union; (ii) in pursuance of section  of the Labour Code, the leaders of workers' associations of any kind must be employees of the pertinent enterprise; and (iii) article . of the Regulations for Labour Organizations (Ministerial Order No. ) makes notifying the employer of the founding of a trade union a prerequisite for its establishment. In view of the foregoing, the Government says that, in the case of ASTAC, the  persons who attended the constituent assembly worked for various employers and that ASTAC did not therefore comply with section  of the Labour Code which requires that trade union organizations comprise workers of the same enterprise. The Government further states that the members of ASTAC may form a social organization (governed by Executive Decree No. ), but"", "".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  January , submitted jointly by the United Workers' Front (FUT), the Ecuadorian Confederation of United Workers' Organizations (CEDOCUT), the Confederation of Workers of Ecuador (CTE), the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Unions (CEOSL), the General Union of Workers of Ecuador (UGTE) and the Federation of Public Sector Workers (FEDESEP); in a communication dated  June  from the Ecuadorian Medical Federation (FME), and in a communication dated  July  from the Works Council for Workers of the Ecuador Inc. Electricity Supply Company.\n.The Government sent its observations in communications dated  June  and  March and  July .\n.Ecuador has ratified the Convention on the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In their communication dated  January , the complainant organizations allege that the Government of Ecuador is attempting to weaken the trade unions through mass dismissals of public sector employees and workers. It is stated in the complaint that Executive Decree No. , issued on  July , which brings about a reform of the rules under the Organic Law on the Civil Service (LOSEP), introduced a procedure known as the  compulsory purchase of redundancy'  enabling the Government to dismiss public sector employees simply by paying them compensation.\n.Termination of employment through the compulsory purchase of redundancy is provided for in article  of the Executive Decree, which stipulates that  State institutions may draw up plans for the compulsory purchase of redundancy with compensation, on a properly budgeted basis, in accordance with article (k) of LOSEP, when undergoing a process of restructuring, optimization or rationalization.' '  Public employees have a duty to comply with processes of this nature that are set by the administration.' The complainant organizations argue that the Executive Decree runs counter to the LOSEP, adopted in , which makes provision for the continuity of employment of public employees.\n.The complainant organizations state that, on the basis of the compulsory redundancy purchase procedure, on  October , the Government dismissed , public sector employees and workers, and in the three months that followed made a further , public sector workers redundant. These redundancies were brought about through administrative acts which do not specify the reason for the termination of employment, and without any prior procedure or provision for challenging them through the courts. The redundancies were accompanied by public statements made by the President of the Republic himself, and by other government spokespersons, making reference to the supposed incompetence and corruption of the workers and employees whose employment had been terminated.\n.The complainant organizations allege that the compulsory purchase of redundancies has been used by the Government as a fig leaf for unfair dismissals and in order to get rid of trade union activists in a discriminatory manner, and especially those holding leadership positions in the trade unions. Given that the LOSEP does not recognize either the right to organize or collective bargaining rights, they argue that these dismissals are part of a government strategy to weaken the trade unions that began with the transfer to the LOSEP system of workers who were previously protected by the Labour Code, so that they would no longer enjoy the protection of collective agreements and the guarantees of the right to organize contained in the Code, the Government s ultimate purpose being to create organizations tailored to its own interests.\n.In support of its allegations, the complaint refers to the mass dismissal of leaders of the following trade unions and works councils: the works council of Guapn Industries, the executive committee of FETSAE, the executive committee (governing body) of the Single Health Union of Sucumbios, the executive committee of the Government of Loja, leaders of the National Federation of Public Works Employees, and the Works Council for Employees of the National Enterprise Bank. The complaint also gives the names of a series of trade union leaders said to have been dismissed through the purchase of compulsory redundancy: Gladys Illiescas of the trade union at the Hospital Tefilo Dvila de Machala, General Secretary of the Union of Nursing Auxiliaries at the Baca Ortiz Hospital; Martha Noboa, Nilo Neiger, Gloria Len and Carmen Herrera of the works council of Guapn Industries; Pal Sacoto, Jos Montesdeoca, Miguel Len, Carlos Garca, Jorge Gualpa, Patricio Ortega, Patricio Merchan, Manuel Sacoto, Carlos Monzn, Carlos Villareal, Manuel Siguenza and  other workers in the works council at the National Enterprise Bank, and Monica Noboa, Luis Rosero, Hctor Paredes, Sibori Arreaga, Narcisa Peralta and Guilermo Parra. The following members of the Ecuadorian Federation of Nurses: Eda Correa Tinoco, President of the College of Nurses of Loja, and Yolanda Nuez, Vice-President of the College of Nurses of Tungurahua. The following members of the Ecuadorian Medical Federation: Eduardo Zea, spokesperson of the Medical College of Pichincha, Nelson Vsconez, President of the Doctors' Association at the Ministry of Public Health, Marco Robles, President of the Medical College of Zamora Chinchipe, Pedro Velasco, former President of the Association of Employees of the Ministry of Public Health. Members of the Ecuadorian Federation of Public Sector Workers: Hctor Dvila, Treasurer, Mnica Pugas, first Chief spokesperson, Emilio Chrrez, second Chief spokesperson, Braulio Bermdez, trustee of the Association of Employees of the Customs Service, Carlos Balden, President of the Association of Municipal Employees of Pichincha, Jaime Coronel, National President of the Public Employees' Association at the Ministry of Agriculture, Stockbreeding and Fisheries and a member of the National Confederation of Public Sector Workers of Ecuador, Eduardo Zea Edison Delgado Falcon, General Secretary of the Works Council for Workers of the Ecuador Inc. Electricity Supply Company, and Wilson Vergara Mosquera, President of the Association of Engineers at the same company.\n.The complainant organizations also allege that the unilateral dismissals brought about through the compulsory purchase of redundancy violated the terms of collective agreements, and especially the provisions concerning continuity of employment and those on retirement pensions.\n.The trade union organizations have instituted proceedings before the Constitutional Court claiming that Decree No.  is unconstitutional, and have also brought contentious proceedings in the administrative courts concerning the dismissals that have already taken place. In this regard, the Ecuadorian Medical Federation alleges that in the present situation in Ecuador, there are neither any guarantees nor any positive expectation that administrative, judicial or constitutional proceedings for violations of human rights and non-compliance with the international Conventions that protect them will be effective, be heard in a timely manner or result in a favourable outcome for the workers. The complainant organizations consider that, in addition to violating internal law, article  of Executive Decree No.  violates ILO Conventions Nos  and , which have been ratified by Ecuador, and they are seeking from the Committee abrogation of the Executive Decree and the elimination of the anti-union practices surrounding its application.\n.In its reply of  June , the Government of Ecuador denies that there is any intention to weaken the trade unions. It expresses its full support for the strengthening of the trade union movement in Ecuador and, by way of proof, points out that during the years  and  approval was given for the constitution and formation of approximately  trade bodies or trade unions, considerably more that the average of  trade unions which had customarily been set up each year. It adds that it has signed  agreements with trade unions, which again demonstrates its support for the trade union movement.\n.As for collective bargaining, the Government recalls that, in accordance with Constituent Resolution No. , the Ministry of Labour and Employment at the time had undertaken, with the participation of employers and workers, to revise collective labour agreements by eliminating the excesses and privileges found in their provisions. Furthermore, through a process of social dialogue and in reliance on Decree No.  of  January , the criteria governing collective bargaining in the public sector had been reformed, in full agreement with the trade unions.\n.The Government states that this same Decree No. , sets the parameters for classifying both public sector employees covered by the LOSEP, and workers covered by the Labour Code. It denies that the transfer to the LOSEP system of workers formerly covered by the Labour Code was done for the purpose of facilitating their dismissal and weakening the trade union movement. It emphasizes that the classification was carried out for the purpose of tidying up the muddle that had come about in the state system relating to public officials, employees and workers.\n.As for the dismissals caused by the compulsory purchase of redundancy, the Government explains that they are in conformity with the provisions of the LOSEP and are justified by the need to restructure state services to make them more efficient. It refers to various aspects of the LOSEP which are designed to make entry to public service careers more transparent, in line with the meritocratic principle. It explains that all the public sector employees affected"", ""s representatives, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour did not decline to engage in dialogue with the representatives of the organization; on the contrary, it attended all the meetings with the various authorities and even provided advice on the framework of labour law which must govern trade union organizations, clarifying any doubts as to the regulatory content of the recently issued ministerial agreements.\n.As to the purported death threats against ASTAC s general coordinator, Mr Jorge Acosta, the Government states that: (i) under article  of the Constitution, every person shall be entitled to free access to justice and the effective, impartial and expeditious protection of his or her rights; (ii) the Government of Ecuador has an obligation to safeguard the wellbeing of its citizens; however, to that end, Ecuadorian citizens must make an application to the relevant legal entity, where it will be duly attended to; and (iii) the electronic system of the Council of the Judiciary contains no records of any criminal complaint from the general coordinator of ASTAC, only an application for protection that had been filed.\n.As to the establishment of an independent inquiry into the various anti-union acts which took place around the founding of the  February Association of Banana Plantation Workers, the Government indicates that the request to launch an inquiry in relation to anti-union acts must be substantiated on the basis of a complaint from the applicant so as to identify the acts violating the alleged constitutional rights, and also indicates that the Ministry of Labour does not have any record of reports of actions directed against the establishment of the association.\n.The Government also transmits the observations of the fruit company Frutas Selectas S.A. (FRUTSESA) ( the fruit company' , which indicates that after conducting a thorough investigation into the allegations, it determined that: the trade union associations to which the Committee refers could not be found; the complaint is illegitimate and misleading; their officials and members were unknown to the entity; it violates the constitutional principle of respect for legal certainty; and in view of the inability to identify a legitimate complainant, it considered that it did not have to make any further comment. In addition, it indicated that it was the Ministry of Labour that did not approve the establishment of an enterprise trade union because the minimum membership had not been attained. As to the complaint of intimidation filed by Mr Luis Ochoa, general secretary of the  February Association of Banana Plantation Workers, against Mr Tito Gentillini, the enterprise indicates that the latter does not represent the enterprise and had merely worked as an external consultant.\n.As to the issuance of the three ministerial agreements, the Government indicates that Ecuadorian legislation fully safeguards freedom of association, the right to organize and the right to a fair wage. The Government states that, although the legislature sought to provide workers with indefinite job stability, with a view to adapting to the needs of each production sector the legislature had left it to the employer s discretion to use other contractual arrangements such as temporary, casual or seasonal contracts (article  of the Labour Code). In addition, in accordance with article . of the Labour Code, the Ministry of Labour is empowered to allow special employment relationships not provided for under the Code, including in the agriculture sector. Consequently, in view of the high percentage of informality in the agricultural sector and the specific needs of the sector, which has specific periods for planting and harvesting that do not correspond to the statutory hours of work established in the Labour Code, the Ministry of Labour decided to adapt to the economic, social and legal reality of the agriculture and banana sectors and to issue the aforementioned ministerial agreements.\n.The Government affirms that those ministerial agreements do not contain any prohibition of or restrictions on freedom of association, as their purpose is to regulate existing labour relations and to prevent precariousness of labour rights. As to the right to fair remuneration, the Government indicates that the minimum wage is set in the sectoral wage scale issued by the Ministry of Labour every year and that it was established through social dialogue between the lawfully constituted workers' organizations at the national level, employers and the Ministry of Labour. However, the Government considers that the minimum pay set by the sectoral wage scale may be improved by agreement between the parties and emphasizes that the labour organizations are a key part of the continuous improvement of remuneration in Ecuador. Furthermore, the Government states that the ministerial agreements allow the possibility to maintain discontinuous stability for workers, analogous to the seasonal contract contemplated in the Labour Code in force, as the employer may call on its workers in each cycle or phase of productivity. Concerning specifically the purported restrictions on the right to freedom of association, the Government affirms that that right is protected under the Constitution. Lastly, the Government makes reference to an application filed by ASTAC on  August  for constitutional review of the aforementioned agreements, and indicates that, on  May , the Constitutional Court denied the application on the grounds that the applicant had failed to argue how the aforementioned ministerial agreements violated the Constitution and the international conventions ratified by Ecuador.\n.The Committee observes that, in this case, the complainants denounce, firstly, the refusal to register a trade union organization of banana plantation workers comprising workers from various companies in the sector and anti-union action against the leaders and members of that union and, secondly, anti-union action aimed at preventing the establishment of a nascent works union in an enterprise in the same sector.\n.Firstly, the Committee recalls that, in its previous examination of the case, it requested the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that national legislation complies with the principles of freedom of association concerning the minimum membership required to establish a trade union at the enterprise level and the possibility of setting up primary-level trade unions comprising workers from various companies, and that it referred the legislative aspects of the case to the CEACR. The Committee notes that the information provided by the Government concerning the regulations for the granting of legal personality to social organizations and the proposed reform of Ministerial Agreement No.  of  and of the Labour Code to assign responsibility to the National Labour and Wage Board, a tripartite advisory body, for defining the number of workers and criteria for determining the number. The Committee refers that information to the attention of the CEACR, to which it has referred the legislative aspects of this case.\n.Secondly, the Committee recalls that in its previous examination of the case, it requested the Government to take the necessary measures to allow the registration of ASTAC. The Committee notes that ASTAC reports that, despite the Committee s recommendations, the Ministry of Labour has still not met with the union, that the Ministry did recognize two branch-level unions (in the horticultural and domestic work sectors) and that certain matters of a political and social nature were impeding the establishment of the trade union organization. The Committee notes that, in turn, the Government reiterates that the application for the approval and registration of the articles of association of ASTAC was rejected because the  founder members were not in a dependent employment relationship with only one employer and that the application for approval of status and granting of legal personality to recognize ASTAC as a social organization was rejected in  because it was flawed in form and substance. The Government adds that: (i) on  February , the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Farming granted legal personality to ASTAC as an agro-production organization; (ii) the Government has no record of ASTAC having filed administrative or legal appeals with a view to continuing the formal process for administrative recognition or a further application to establish a trade union organization; and (iii) denies that the Ministry of Labour declined to meet with ASTAC leaders and states that it even advised them on the recent legislative changes that affect the banana sector.\n.The Committee notes with regret that because its members do not work for the same employer, ASTAC has still not been recognized as a trade union organization. While pointing out once again that branch-level trade unions have been recognized in other sectors in the country, the Committee recalls that, in its previous examination of the case, it noted with concern that many agricultural workers in Ecuador not only find it impossible to set up company unions owing to the minimum membership requirement which is conflicting with the structure of a sector where most production units are small, but that they were also seeing their efforts to overcome that obstacle by grouping together in sectoral organizations being frustrated. The Committee observes that, on the one hand, ASTAC states that no representatives of its organization have managed to meet with the Ministry of Labour to discuss the union s registration and the situation""]"
