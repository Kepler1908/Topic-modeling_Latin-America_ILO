According to information received by the mission, Guatemala is living in a state of insecurity because of the persistent policy of intimidation and terror employed against the population, while the practice of arrest and disappearance has become a standard and systematic instrument of repression from which an alarming number of victims have suffered, especially trade union leaders both in the towns and in the country.\n.The ICFTU adds that the mission drew up a list of cases of arrest and disappearance, assassinations and attacks on trade union leaders and activists;  instances of arrest and disappearance and  assassinations were cited between  and May . The list of trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or been kidnapped, assassinated or physically attacked appears in an annex to this report. (This list does not include persons already cited in other cases brought before the Committee on Freedom of Association.)\n.In its communication dated  July , the WFTU refers to the kidnapping of trade union leader Felicita Floridalma Lucero, an allegation that was previously brought before the Committee in connection with Case No. .\n.In its communication dated  September , FASGUA alleges that on  September  the body was discovered of Eleazar Esa Barrera Martnez, an employee of the textile factory Fbrica de Tejidos Imperial who had been kidnapped during mass demonstrations against the increase in prices and in support of wage claims. According to FASGUA, his body was found hanging by the neck from an electric wire and bore signs of torture.\n.FASGUA adds that on the morning of  September  nurse Rita Josefina Pineda Aldana was kidnapped by armed men.\n.Finally, FASGUA alleges that on  September ,  members of the National Army supported by  artillery trucks and about  tanks launched an attack on the University of San Carlos and searched every building, including the headquarters of the University Workers\' Union where they caused extensive damage and seized trade union documents.\n.The Government states in its communications dated  August  that all the complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association communicated to it by the ILO have been passed on to the Ministry of the Interior with instructions to transmit to the Committee on Freedom of Association any information that may come to light as a result of its inquiries.\n.The Government adds that a copy of the statement it received to the effect that Floridalma Lucero y Lucero and Amancio Samuel Villatoro had disappeared has been communicated to the competent tribunal and that investigations are being conducted to determine their whereabouts. With respect to the disappearance of Julin Revolorio, Raymundo Prez, Yolanda Urizar Martnez de Aguilar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Victor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her children, Fermn Solano, Antonio Argeta and Sergio Venicio Samayoa Morales, the Government states that none of the persons cited are being held in any of the country\'s detention centres but that inquiries are being made into their whereabouts. The Government indicates that, in the case of investigations of this nature, the judiciary is duly informed by the General Directorate of the National Police through the competent tribunal.\n.The Government states further that it has collaborated closely with the judiciary and the Supreme Court of Justice in the investigations into disappearances and in the habeas corpus proceedings. The Head of State has accordingly set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared; in its efforts to arrive at the truth, the Committee has conducted an investigation throughout the country, issued the necessary orders to all state security forces and invited the civilian authorities to collaborate. It appears from the investigations that the persons whose names appear on the list submitted by the Mutual Support Group to the committee are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre in the country.\n.The Government goes on to state that the investigations must be considered as being still under way since, inter alia, it has not yet been possible to obtain the list of Guatemalan citizens who have emigrated to Mexico in order to determine whether some of the persons who have disappeared are listed as official residents of that country. The Government indicates that, at the request of the interested parties and in accordance with the law, the State Prosecutor\'s Office has initiated penal proceedings with the Court of First Instance and with the Justices of the Peace of the Penal Branch of the Departments of Petn, Quetzaltenango, Zacapa and Guatemala City in connection with alleged kidnappings and has taken part in proceedings already initiated. The Government states that in the course of the investigations conducted in the various departments of the Republic, no allegations were made regarding the existence of detention centres other than the legally constituted penal centres for preventive detention and for the serving of prison sentences.\n.The Government declares that the committee has conducted a thorough official investigation at the national level, employing all possible means at its disposal, and that its report constitutes the most thorough investigation of the problem of ""disappeared persons"" that the present Government has carried out in its efforts to establish the facts.\n.Finally, with respect to the alleged closing down of operations at the Universal Textiles Factory, the Government states that the General Labour Inspectorate and the General Labour Directorate collaborated fully with the workers who had lodged a petition against its closure. According to the Government, the workers and the undertaking reached an agreement which included the payment of compensation. The only point on which agreement was not reached, despite the efforts of the General Labour Inspectorate, concerned five trade union leaders. Charges were accordingly brought against the undertaking in June  with the competent labour tribunal which has not yet handed down its ruling.\n.The Committee notes the Government\'s statement that the Head of State has set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Ministry of National Defence, the State Prosecutor\'s Office and the Ministry of the Interior to determine the whereabouts of the persons listed as having disappeared and that the Committee has conducted a nation-wide investigation with the collaboration of the civilian and military authorities. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, the persons listed as having disappeared are not being held in any penal or preventive detention centre.\n.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, inquiries have been made into the whereabouts of trade union leaders Felicita Floridalma Lucero y Lucero, Amancio Samuel Villatorio and Sergio Vinicio Samayoa Morales. The Committee also notes the Government\'s statement that it has not yet been possible to establish the whereabouts of other kidnapped trade union leaders and members (Julin Revolorio, Raimundo Prez, Yolanda Urzar, Manuel Francisco Contreras, Jos Luis Ramos, Luis Estrada, Vctor Ascn, Lucrecia Orellana, Graciela Samayoa and her two children, Fermn Solano and Antonia Argeta). The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied any details on the other  trade union leaders and members who have disappeared or on the alleged assassination of  trade union leaders and members and physical attacks on another union leader. The Committee further recalls that it had requested the Government to conduct a judicial inquiry into the attempted kidnapping and physical attacks on former trade union leader Alvaro Ren Sosa.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recalls in general terms that when a climate of violence prevails in a country, this renders the exercise of trade union rights practically impossible and also recalls, as did the International Labour Conference in its  Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, that the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights and that the rights conferred on workers\' and employers\' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties. It expresses its profound concern at the seriousness of a situation in which a large number of trade union leaders and members', 'case the allegation concerns the kidnapping of the brother of a trade union leader who had escaped various attempts at capture), the Committee urgently requests the Government to carry out the necessary investigations to determine the whereabouts of the persons who have allegedly disappeared and to initiate a judicial inquiry with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties for the kidnappings or attempted kidnappings.

Lastly, it should be recalled once more that the prohibitions which barred these persons from entering the country were in no way related to trade union activities which they may have carried out in the past in Chile. Moreover, the Government rejects the false charges that it is adopting ""new methods of repression against Chilean trade union leaders"". The Government\'s communication states that by granting entry to the country and terminating exile, it shows its intention to return as soon as possible to the broadest institutional normalcy, so that all Chileans may choose their own destiny, in peace and free from foreign interference.\n.In a communication dated  February , the Government states that Luis Meneses Aranda, if he has not acquired another nationality, must request travel documents from the government of the country where he is residing. The Chilean consular authorities have been instructed to grant him a temporary visa for  days so that he may visit the country and personally handle his temporary or permanent residence, whichever is the case, and regularise his situation.\n.In a further communication of  February , the Government states that Messrs. Bustos, Martinez and Labraa have been released and have brought an appeal to modify the sentences handed down against them. The appeal will be heard by a higher court during the last week of February .\n.The allegations which remained pending following the most recent examination of the case in November , concerned the trial of Beatriz Brikmann; the threats to the lives of trade union leaders of the AGECH, the Teachers\' Trade Union of Via del Mar, and of the Workers in Commerce Trade Union; the intervention by police forces in a national mobilisation of workers convened by the National Grouping of Workers (CNT) which led to the injury and arrest of leaders of that organisation; the difficulties encountered by workers in the Baby Colloky enterprise in signing a collective agreement and the enterprise\'s refusal to recognise the workers\' representatives; the legal provisions which make the holding of trade union office incompatible with affiliation in a political party; the ineligibility of the president of the National Confederation of Chilean Peasants (CNC) to hold the office to which he was elected; the assault and arrest at the hands of security forces of dozens of workers and trade unionists during a national day of protest called by the CNT in October , and continued threats against the lives of CNT president, Manuel Bustos, as well as the judicial summons of CNT leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa and their subsequent imprisonment. Since then, the Committee has received new allegations concerning the authorities\' refusal to renew the passport of Carmen Pinto, and the situation of trade unionist Luis Meneses, who was stripped of his Chilean citizenship and has been authorised to enter the country only on a temporary basis, and the sentence handed down as regards CNT trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa.\n.As regards the WCOTP complaints concerning telephone threats to the lives of trade union leaders of the Teachers\' College of Chile in Valparaiso, the AGECH, the Teachers\' Trade Union of Via del Mar, and the Workers in Commerce Trade Union, as well as the complaints filed by the CNT and the ICFTU concerning continued threats to the lives of trade union leader Manuel Bustos, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government concerning the corresponding investigations and the request for protection provided for by legislation when the authenticity and seriousness of the threat is demonstrated; in view of the numerous allegations of this nature which have been received since this case was opened, the Committee wishes to point out that a trade union movement in which trade union leaders are able to represent fully the interests of workers, in freedom and independence, cannot develop where trade unionists are threatened and live in fear; it urges the Government to undertake judicial investigations with a view to putting an end to these acts of intimidation which sow uncertainty in trade union ranks.\n.As regards the death of Jos Carrasco Tapia, a trade union leader of the Metropolitan Journalists\' Council, and the attempted murder of Juan Espinoza, a national trade union leader of the Confederation of Maritime Workers (CONGEMAR) and his family, the Committee notes that in the case of Mr. Carrasco Tapia the Government states that the matter is being investigated, although the guilty parties have not yet been identified; and that in the case of Mr. Espinoza and his family, no charges were filed in connection with the attempted arson of his home, while he and his family slept; the Committee recalls that murder and other violent acts affecting trade unionists are serious matters which require the authorities to adopt severe measures with a view to re-establishing a normal situation.\n.As regards the various complaints concerning the arrest of trade unionists, presented by the CUT, ICFTU, WFTU and CNT, concerning trade union leaders Rodolfo Seguel (CNT), Manuel Rodrguez, Jorge Pavez (AGECH) and Guillermo Azula (AGECH), of  March , for having participated in a peaceful demonstration to demand the reinstatement of , teachers dismissed during the course of , the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that these persons were arrested for obstructing the passage of vehicles and persons on a public thoroughfare, and that they were released following a summons by the Local Police Court, a court which imposes small fines for traffic violations, with the exception of Mr. Azula, in regards to whom there are no records of arrest and who is currently at liberty. As regards the arrest of a number of miners and their confinement in the Santiago Penitentiary for participating in days of protest in support of the right to work, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that, with the exception of Domingo Alvial Mundaca, who is on trial for the illegal possession of explosives and detonators and for engaging in terrorist acts, the other miners mentioned by the complainant organisation are not currently under arrest. As regards the detention of former CUT trade union leaders Luis Guzmn and Mireya Baltra, who are allegedly being detained illegally in the Santiago Penitentiary, as well as that of Sergio Luis Lazo, who is alleged to have subsequently disappeared, the Committee takes note of the information furnished by the Government to the effect that Luis Guzmn is being tried for the crimes specified in the Act on the control of arms and explosives, for forgery of public instruments, and for entering the country illegally, and is not being detained illegally, but that his confinement has been ordered by the courts; likewise, the Committee takes note of the fact that Sergio Luiz Lazo was authorised to enter the country on  June , and that he has not been, and is not currently being, detained; and that Mireya Baltra is in the country and enjoys complete freedom.\n.As regards the complaint of several trade union organisations concerning the arrest and subsequent imprisonment of trade union leaders Manuel Bustos, Arturo Martnez and Moiss Labraa, on charges of incitement to strike and paralyse trade, production, and public services on  October , the Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government concerning the proceedings against the above-mentioned trade union leaders. The Committee expresses its concern that Manuel Bustos and Arturo Martnez have been sentenced to  days\' imprisonment, and Moiss Labraa to  days\' imprisonment for breach of the State Security Act, and wishes to emphasise that the arrest and sentencing of workers\' representatives for activities related to the defence of workers\' interests are contrary to the principle of free exercise of trade union rights. It notes in this connection that Messrs. Bustos, Martnez and Labraa are free and have appealed against these sentences.\n.The Committee must also express its concern with respect to the continuing numerous complaints received since this case was opened, in connection with the arrest and/or imprisonment of trade unionists, although it wishes to state that it has taken note of the fact that certain arrests for which complaints have been field (in particular, the arrest of Luis Guzmn and Domingo Alvial Mundaca) fall beyond the scope of the freedom of association and, therefore, the competence of this Committee. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall that although trade union responsibilities do not confer the right to transgress legal provisions with impunity, such legal provisions should not undermine basic guarantees as regards freedom of association, nor sanction activities which, in accordance with generally accepted principles, should be considered as legitimate trade union activities.\n.As regards the raid on the headquarters of the Federation of Self-Employed and Part-Time Workers\' Trade Union, and the home of trade union leader Alejandro Olivares Prez', 'the death threats and abduction of members of the trade union of the ESDEE Maquiladora enterprise: the Government is gathering information;- the attempted abduction of Mr. Pablo Mazariegos: no denunciation had been made because the victim was not sure who was responsible. He indicated that he has been subject to no recent persecution or threats;- the capture and torture of Mr. Eligio Quej Morn: the Government is collecting information;- the imprisonment of Mr. Rubn Terry Amzquita: he has left the country and gone into exile.\n.As concerns the allegations with respect to anti-union discrimination and practices contrary to collective bargaining, the Government provided the following information:- as concerns the collective dispute at the La Patria farm, a collective agreement providing for the reinstatement of the dismissed persons was signed with the mediation of the General Labour Inspectorate;- Ernesto Bol was reinstated in his job;- as concerns the attacks on Werner Coc Ramrez, the Government has asked for further information from the complainant about the place where this unionist works;- as concerns the MK S.A. and L&L S.A. enterprises, the respective judges have not yet handed down their judgements;- as concerns the refusal by the National Committee for the Blind and Deaf Mutes of Guatemala, the judicial proceedings have not yet been concluded;- as concerns the Unicasa S.A. and Welly S.A. enterprises, the General Labour Inspectorate initiated a penal trial before the judicial authority which is still pending;- the reinstatement of the workers on the El Salto farm continues to be discussed in the tribunals;- as concerns the Bolivia farm, thanks to a commission made up of various authorities and established at the request of the Popular Workers\' Federation, an agreement has been arrived at in which the parties withdrew the judicial action initiated;- as concerns the alleged refusal to negotiate in the Los Angeles farm, a collective agreement was made on  October  with the intervention of the General Labour Inspectorate;- as concerns the La Argentina farm, no denunciations were presented;- as concerns the Diseos y Maquilas S.A. enterprise, the industrial dispute was resolved with the making of a collective agreement.\n.In their communication of July , the IUF and the ICFTU state that Mrs. Flor de Mara Salguero de Laparra, a trade unionist of the Trade Union Federation of Food, Agro-Industry and Related Workers (FESTRAS), a trade union organization in the maquila sector, received death threats in ; on  May  she was abducted, drugged, beaten and raped; after her release she received further intimidating telephone calls recalling the assault against her on  May.\n.In its communications of July, October and December , the ICFTU indicates that in the middle of March , Mr. Alexander Yovany Gmez Virula, a leader of the trade union in the RCA enterprise, was assassinated. Mr. Ivo Adio Garca Rivera, an official of the Trade Union of Electricity and Energy Workers was abducted and freed the following day after being submitted to severe psychological pressure and that these events were related to a work stoppage in August . Furthermore, the ICFTU alleges the assassination of Mr. Eric Osberto Berganza Pacheco, an official of the Trade Union of Workers of the National Electrification Institute on  July , which the trade union says was the result of his trade union activities. Further threats were also made against the trade unionist Dbora Guzmn and against the child which she was expecting, to make her force her husband, Flix Hernndez, an official of the Lunafil Trade Union, to leave the trade union. The ICFTU adds also that Mr. Ernesto Bol, an official of the Trade Union of the Workers of the City of Coban was severely beaten and insulted on  November  by unknown people; furthermore it was not possible for him to be reinstated in his post even with the existence of a judicial order to this effect.\n.Finally, the ICFTU alleges that in the Las Delicias farm, in Retalhuleu, which belongs to the Good Year S.A. Rubber Plantations multinational enterprise, attempts have been made for many years to destroy the Trade Union of Rubber Plantation Workers in the Las Delicias farm through radical anti-union measures designed to intimidate workers, such as the systematic dismissal of workers who were trade union members, violations of the fundamental right to engage in collective bargaining (the enterprise has appointed a group of non-unionized workers to represent all the workers) and the unacceptable measures of reprisal taken by the enterprise, such as the closing down of the school and clinic which depend on the enterprise and the recent refusal to pay wages for the last two months to unionized workers.\n.The Committee notes the willingness of the Government to reply to all the allegations and the extensive report of the Presidential Commission for the Coordination of Executive Policy on Human Rights and observes that it contains some information on most of the pending allegations concerning deaths, disappearances, acts of violence against trade unionists and anti-union dismissals. The Committee notes that proceedings or investigations have been initiated concerning the death of the trade unionists Juan Tarax and Lilian Elizabeth Jurez Escobar (the responsible official was placed before the competent court), Camilo Ajqui Gimon (who the Government denies as a unionist), Adrin Miranda Lpez and Velizario Lpez Rojas, the arrests of the trade unionists Silvio Pastor, Pablo Itzel, Teodoro Pastor, Rolando Pastor and Francisco Pastor (which resulted in the dismissal of a captain), the abduction of Walter Njera Molina (who was released), the disappearance of Gustavo Rosalio Vsquez Lpez and the attacks against Ernesto Bol. However, the Committee deeply regrets that the information supplied by the Government gives no indication that significant progress has been made in the investigations of the numerous cases of alleged violence. The Committee therefore requests the Government to keep it informed in this regard. The Committee also notes the information from the Government categorically denying the alleged police repression of strikers at the Social Security Institute on  February  (no force was used and the police presence was confined to guaranteeing freedom to work), and that the detention of officials of the STIGSS during a strike was for a short period and due to the unlawful seizure of vehicles, and that the guilty parties were fined by the magistrates court; the Government also denies that there has been any detention or arrest of trade unionists in the Mahler y Sucesoras enterprise on  March  and states that there was only a meeting held during working time and which resulted in the signing of documents in an agreement reached between the parties on the existing labour dispute.\n.The Committee notes that the Government requests clarification from the complainants on the following allegations: the death of Messrs. Jos Mara Incuyat, Julio Csar Prez and Pedro Genovevo Escobar, the armed attack against Mr. Victor Alfredo Chacoj and the attacks against Werner Coc Ramrez. The Committee therefore requests the complainants to provide the information available to them on these allegations to enable the Government to reply.\n.As regards the other allegations of deaths, disappearance or acts of violence against trade unionists, although the Committee notes that the Government states in some cases that no denunciations have been made, that the persons concerned were not trade union officials, that the events were not related to the trade union activities or functions of the victims or that the persons concerned have gone into exile abroad, the Committee emphasizes the need to open or continue investigations against those responsible for the offences committed (see the respective list in Annex I). In this respect, the Committee would like to reiterate the conclusions which it reached at its meeting in June  (see th Report, paras.  and ), which are reproduced below:The Committee deeply deplores the many violent deaths of trade union officials and trade unionists, as well as the disappearances, abductions, arbitrary arrests, acts of aggression and death threats which have occurred since the presentation of the complaints (), and expresses its deep concern at the situation of impunity (only in one of the assassinations to which the Government refers does it appear that the authors have been identified) and insists on the absolute need to open judicial inquiries on all the cases before the Committee with a view to ascertaining the facts and punishing the guilty parties. In this connection, the Committee recalls the commitment made by the Attorney-General of the Republic to open inquiries on all the cases placed before the Committee and asks the Government to keep it informed in this respect.Although it is aware of the difficult situation affecting Guatemala and of the Government\'s policy for the promotion of human rights, the Committee recalls that ""the rights of workers\' and employers\' organizations can only be exercised in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind against these organizations\' leaders and members and that it is for governments to ensure that this principle is respected"" (see st Report, Case No.  (Nicaragua), para. , and th Report,', 'agriculture. These allegations are reproduced in Annex I of this report. In addition, the outstanding allegations also concern the occupation and destruction of trade union premises by law enforcement services, coupled with the theft of equipment and money, and the repression of trade union demonstrations.\n.In particular, the complainants had described a first destruction of the FENASTRAS and UNTS headquarters by the explosion of a charge of dynamite on  February  which allegedly caused serious damage to the building and destroyed all the furnishings. There were no fatalities, but a number of people suffered minor injuries. An anti-communist urban commando claimed responsibility for the attack. The complainants explained that on  February  the FENASTRAS and UNTS had called a meeting of workers which met at the premises which had been attacked, and that military forces had intervened by encircling the neighbourhood and blocking off the street with tanks while some  workers were inside the building.\n.The complainants had also reported that other premises had been attacked, namely, the headquarters of the National Agricultural Workers\' Association (ANTA) in San Salvador on  September , during the course of which the Rural Police and infantry brigades illegally entered the premises and arrested  persons (who were released three days later), and carried off office equipment and money; also, the premises of the same Association at Santa Lucia were assaulted on  December , and the Association\'s treasurer was arrested by agents of the Second Infantry Brigade of Santa Ana. These agents are also alleged to have carried off all furnishings and equipment. Lastly, the complainants had referred to the violent breakup of a demonstration of the Confederation of Co-operative Associations of El Salvador (COACES) and the National Peasants\' Union (UNC), on  December  in the Colon Park. They alleged that members of the Second Infantry Brigade and the Rural Police of Santa Ana struck, wounded and arrested several persons, and seized speakers, radio equipment, photographic equipment and recorders.\n.At its November  Session, the Governing Body approved the Committee\'s following interim recommendations:(a) The Committee deeply deplores the violent situation prevailing in the country. It expresses its grave concern at the extreme seriousness of the allegations which refer mainly to  murders since , disappearances and more than  arrests of trade union officials, trade unionists and co-operative members, as well as to various acts of violence and intimidation (threats, breaking into and searching of trade union premises and a bomb attack against one of these premises).(b) The Committee can only deeply deplore and reprove the violent deaths and disappearances. It urges the Government to open judicial inquiries into these murders and disappearances and to send it as soon as possible all available information, in particular relating to the situation of the detainees and the reasons for their detention, and on the stage of the inquiries as to the whereabouts of those who have disappeared.(c) The Committee urges the Government to adopt strong measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised under normal conditions, i.e., in a situation where fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate that is free from violence, pressure or threats of any kind. The Committee requests the Government to inform it on this matter.(d) The Committee decides to examine at its next meeting the allegations contained in the most recent communications from the ICFTU and ASTTEL as the Government\'s reply was received only a few days before the Committee\'s current meeting.\n.The ASTTEL and ICFTU communications received on ,  and  September , shortly before the Committee\'s November  meeting, state that between  and  September  the armed forces arrested  trade unionists and peasants. In particular, the ICFTU denounces the arrest of  trade unionists on  September , reporting that they were brutally beaten and psychologically tortured, that eight women were raped and that one person was hospitalised for serious injuries in the Rosales Hospital. The ICFTU adds that  persons were released on  September, but that all those who held office in the FENASTRAS trade unions are still imprisoned. The names of the  members of AGEMHA, SELSA and FENASTRAS who were imprisoned are contained in Annex II(a).\n.In a further communication of  November  the ICFTU reports a second and much more serious destruction of the FENASTRAS headquarters. It alleges that nine persons belonging to the Committee of Mothers of Detained and Disappeared Persons (COMADRES) were killed and  were injured on  October  while meeting peacefully at the FENASTRAS headquarters, when the premises were destroyed by the explosion of a powerful charge of dynamite. The United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS) and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) in communications of  and  November  also denounce this serious bombing of the FENASTRAS headquarters which left nine persons dead and many injured. The names of those killed and wounded are contained in Annex II(b).\n.In other communications of January and April  the ICFTU expresses its deep concern over the assault of the premises of another organisation, namely, the Democratic Workers\' Confederation (CTD), an ICFTU affiliate, by the National Guard and the Rural Police, on  January , and the arrest of  trade unionists whose names are listed in Annex II(c). The ICFTU also reports the disappearance of Jorge Alberto Villegas, General Secretary for Disputes of the National Association of Salvadorian Teachers (ANDES  June), who was forcefully abducted from his home in Soyapango on  April  by the National Guard. This allegation is confirmed by the WCOTP in a communication of  April  (see Annex II(d)).\n.In communications of  February and  April , the FUSS denounces very serious violations of human rights which took place between November  and April , and which struck the trade union movement very hard. In particular, it denounces the murder of five trade union leaders during the period of November  to March , namely: Rodolfo Andrs Prieto, Miguel Angel Hernandez, Carlos Humberto Gomez, Ral Gonzales and Luis Colocho; the injuries inflicted on five trade unionists on  November ; and the disappearance of six trade unionists between November  and March  following bombardments of the civilian population (see Annex II(e)). The FUSS states that the Government is engaged in a campaign to murder the major trade union leaders who oppose official policy, and that it offers a reward of , colons to persons revealing the whereabouts of these trade unionists.\n.The FUSS next describes in detail the tragic events of November . On  November, it states, the army arrested  workers of the University of El Salvador at their workplace. The university was subjected to intense bombings by the Salvadorian Air Force, and the ensuing fires destroyed the Schools of Medicine and Dentistry; on the th, ten trade unions of public employees called a work stoppage to protest these bombings and to enable workers to tend to their brothers who had been injured or killed; on the th, the armed forces published a list of names identifying leaders of the UNTS, accusing them of massacres which the army itself had committed, and issuing orders for their arrest; it also ordered its troops to take over and destroy the premises of popular, trade union and occupational organisations and to arrest trade unionists; at dawn on the th, direct actions of reprisal began against the leaders of trade union and popular organisations, accompanied by searches of the premises of various organisations. The armed forces searched homes of several UNTS trade union leaders and machine-gunned those of persons who were not found at home. These trade unionists are Guillermo Rojas, Humberto Centeno, Rosario Acosta, Julio Portillo, Marco Tulio Lima and Francisco Martnez; on the th, some , workers living in the town of Apopa and in districts and farms bordering the north of San Salvador were made to abandon their homes in an atmosphere of panic, when the Government\'s radio network urged them to leave the area, which they interpreted as a prelude to a bombardment. As a result of the indiscriminate bombardments of the civilian population by the Salvadorian Air Force, several trade unionists have been wounded. Their names appear in Annex II(e).\n.Returning to the events of November , the FUSS alleges that the national police arrested six members of the "" May unit"" of the Trade Union of Social Security Workers (STISSS), as well as the leader of the Committee of Dismissed and Unemployed Workers of El Salvador (CODYDES) and the leader of FENASTRAS (see Annex II(f)).\n.It also cites other arrests which took place between November  and April  and which involved  trade unionists from several branches of the economy, but primarily from agriculture. According to the allegations, some of these trade unionists were savagely tortured, hung by their arms for three days and by their feet for a further three days, and made to suffer electric shocks all over their bodies (see Annex II(g)).

The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General\'s representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.\n.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers\' organisations.\n.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).\n.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General\'s representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.\n.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General\'s representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.\n.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General\'s representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers\' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers\' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested.

The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government\'s attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle']"

The Government points out in general terms in that connection that employers\' and workers\' organisations are required to respect the law of the land as provided by Article  of Convention No. .\n.The Government adds that the Constitution of Guatemala which entered into force in  guarantees the application of the rights and freedoms defined in Conventions Nos.  and ; that workers and employers have the right to exercise them in defence of their economic and social interests; and that the authorities, including the competent courts, are performing their constitutional duties within the framework of a State based on law. According to the Government all persons, including organisations covered by Conventions Nos.  and , can exercise their constitutional rights in conformity with the Constitution and the laws of the Republic.\n.In conclusion the Government states that it would be grateful if the Committee would include the foregoing observations in its final conclusions.\n.In Case No.  ICFTU alleges in a telegram of  March  the death of Manuel de Jess Lpez Morales of the Electricity and Energy Trade Union, whose body had been found mutilated and covered with obvious marks of torture. The victim had been kidnapped a few days earlier by persons unknown. In addition, the trade unionists Jlio Martnez and Ricardo Bonilla of the Unified Trade Union Confederation of Guatemala (CUSG), affiliated to ICFTU, were said to have received death threats.\n.In its communication of  March ICFTU furnishes detailed information on the foregoing allegations, indicating that the murders of certain trade union leaders were brought to its knowledge on  November . Specifically ICFTU claims that the facts are as follows:- on  June  Benjamn Borja Leonardo, a welder aged  years, is said to have disappeared while he was organising a trade union in Hoppy S.A., a banana company owned by Gustavo Anzueto Willman, a retired colonel;- on  June  Gerardo Asaor Letona, a gardener in the Service Department of the Faculty of Science of the National and Autonomous University of San Carlos, is said to have been detained; his fate remains unknown;- in October  Emilio Bentez, leader of the Welders\' Trade Union, is said to have been pursued by paramilitary groups who broke into his home and, not finding him there, expressed the intention to murder him;- in rural areas armed civilian groups are said to continue terrorising the peasants on the pretext that they are suspected of opposition sympathies; the victims and their families are said not to be making this public for fear of reprisals.\n.Furthermore  trade unions organised by an organisation affiliated to ICFTU are said to be waiting to receive legal personality from the Directorate-General of Labour.\n.In addition the Guatemalan Institute of Social Studies and Training is said to be recruiting , educators for organising and educational duties among the workers of town and countryside; their wages are to be paid by the Ministry of Urban and Rural Development. The purpose of this measure is said to be to recruit state-paid educators in order to establish an official trade union confederation, as is said to be proved by an unsigned memorandum circulated to Christian Democrat deputies on  June .\n.Again: at the Guatemalan undertaking GUATEL, Mario Lpez Estrada, the manager, is said to support a body called the "" February Committee"" led by Ral Rodrguez, a member of the above-mentioned Institute. This committee is said to be a parallel organisation to the lawful trade union already present in the undertaking.\n.In other instances, workers are said to have been subjected to measures of intimidation. Thus Pascual Ruch Hernndez, general secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of San Jos Nacahuil, is said to have been taken in for questioning by uniformed police without a warrant on three occasions. Luis Antonio Morn, general secretary of the Bran Canhuaco Rural Trade Union, is said to have been brutally beaten by a person in plain clothes during a union meeting and the complaint filed with the authorities against the attacker, who was identified, is said to have produced no result. The workers of ""Los Diamantes"" ranch in the Department of Escuintla are said to have reported threats uttered by the manager, who is said to be preventing them from establishing a trade union.\n.Lastly four persons are said to have been murdered: Edgar de la Paz, aged  years, a railway employee and a member of the Railway Trade Union, kidnapped by a group of civilians who are said to have tied him to a tree, sprinkled petrol over him and burned him; Mara Luisa Recinos Satoj, a teacher aged  years, found dead after a week in captivity on a ranch at Siquinala, Department of Escuintla; an unidentified woman whose body is said to have been found bound hand and foot and bearing signs of torture and mutilation and who according to witnesses had been a manual worker; and a member of the Central Trade Union of Municipal Workers who died after being savagely beaten by persons unknown.\n.In its reply of  April  the Government categorically denies the existence of armed civilian groups threatening the peasants in rural areas. It states that no official complaints have been made to that effect. The Government affirms in the democratic process now under way, no one is subjected to persecution, and especially not sympathisers of opposition political groups.\n.More specifically it states with regard to Emilio Bentez, leader of the Welders\' Trade Union, who according to the complainants had been persecuted by paramilitary groups, that in the absence of a definite date and of a complaint it can institute no inquiries.\n.With regard to the charges of denial of legal personality to certain trade unions, the Government transmits a list of the unions which have been recognised in  and of those awaiting the signature of the Office of the President of the Republic. It adds that it will transmit as soon as possible a list of the associations in process of approval and an indication of the statutory conditions which they have not yet met.\n.With regard to the charge concerning the alleged establishment of an official trade union confederation on the pretext of organising and educating the workers of town and countryside, the Government expresses concern at such misinformation and at the bad faith of the informants of international organisations. It explains that in reality the Ministry of Development has indeed recruited , rural and urban educators belonging to a community development association, a non-profit, non-governmental organisation specialising in vocational training and in the endeavour to attain even levels of development. The aim of the educators in question, however, according to the Government, is to support communal organisation in order to establish local development boards as part of the new structure at regional and local level. These local development boards are to work directly in agreement with the National Board of Urban and Rural Development, which will bring together those who function as decision-makers at the local level. It is therefore absurd to imagine that the human resources in question, for whose training the Ministry of Devlopment is responsible, are intended to set up an ""official trade union confederation"". The Government asks the Committee not to let itself be misled by the information given in the memorandum, which has nothing genuine about it.\n.As to the charge concerning the alleged parallel trade union set up in the GUATEL undertaking, the Government states that ICFTU has submitted no evidence to warrant the assertion that the manager of GUATEL has supported the establishment of a committee parallel to the lawful trade union of the undertaking.\n.With regard to the alleged measures of intimidation to which workers are said to have been subjected in the pursuit of their trade union activities, the Government states that, in the absence of exact dates for the alleged events, it is practically impossible for it to pin down the information covered by the complaints.\n.Lastly, with regard to the alleged murders of trade unionists, the Government communicates the following information:- Edgar de la Paz, who according to the complainants was  years old and a railway employee, is said to be in reality Edgar Paz Tello, a worker in the area of the Permanent Way, and to belong in reality to the Rural Workers\' Union. According to the Government, the man himself stated in the national press that on the morning of  November, when he was drunk and had fallen asleep on the public highway, thieves robbed him of a cheque for  quetzales and his driving licence. They then sprinkled petrol over him and set fire to him. In a fainting condition, he claims, he was taken by several persons to the Guatemalan Institute of Social Security, where he was given treatment and', 'of elections for new trade union leaders, and it was a matter of public knowledge at the date of the Government\'s reply that that trade union organisation had been left without legal representatives and that its activities had been suspended.
