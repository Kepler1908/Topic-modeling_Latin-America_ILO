0,".The Committee examined this case, which concerns the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, at its November  Session, when it submitted to the Governing Body a final report, contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March , ). The case concerned, in particular, the right to establish federations and the control of trade union funds by the administrative authorities.
.By a communication dated  May  the Government made certain observations on the conclusions reached by the Committee In the light of these observations the Committee re-examined the case as a whole at its November  session and submitted a further report containing definitive conclusions in which it repeated the remarks it had made previously. This review of the case is to be found in the Committee's rd Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The Government sent a further communication on  February  in which it made observations on the conclusions set forth by the Committee in its rd Report. Having examined these observations, the Committee is of the opinion that they contain nothing which would lead it to modify its earlier conclusions, and for this reason it recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee examined this case previously at its meeting in November , when it submitted to the Governing Body a final report, to be found in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).
.By a communication dated  May , the Government made certain observations on the conclusions reached by the Committee in this case.
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its general conclusions with regard to the case, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body, inter alia:(c) with regard to the composition of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the legislation in force is incompatible with the right of trade unions to establish federations of their own choosing;(d) with regard to the allegation that the Ministry of Labour seized control of the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua, to draw the Government's attention to the principle that control over the internal acts of a trade union should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority, or by a person who enjoys some degree of independence of the administrative authorities and who is himself subject to the control of the judicial authorities, and to point out that the authorisation still required by the Teachers' Union of Managua to draw on its bank accounts runs counter to the right of trade unions to organise their administration and activities;(e) with regard to the allegation concerning interference by the authorities in the establishment of new unions, to draw the attention of the Government to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom;
.As concerns the composition of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, the Government had stated previously that this organisation had been guilty of breaches of the Trade Union Regulations, and that, in particular, it was composed of unions from different departments, thus contravening the provisions of section  of the Regulations, which provides that trade unions from different departments may not form a federation. The Committee had expressed the view that such a provision constituted a restriction of the right of workers' organisations to establish federations and Confederations, recognised by Article  of Convention No..In this connection, the Committee recalled the importance that should be attached to the principle laid down in Article  of Convention No.  that workers shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing, a principle that implies for the organisations themselves the right to establish and join federations and Confederations of their own choosing (Articles  and  of the Convention). The Committee therefore considered that conditions laid down by law for the organisation of federations were incompatible with these standards, which include the right of trade unions to form such federations as they see fit.
.In its new communication the Government maintains that the aforementioned provision of the Trade Union Regulations owes its existence to the fact that organisations are the product of mutual and identical interests arising from the close connection of these organisations. On the other hand, even between persons having the same trade or occupation, their problems differ depending on the geographical location of their work. Section  of the Regulations is extremely conducive to the orderly establishment of federations, which cannot in some cases reconcile divergences between trade unions. The Government further points out that the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation has likewise failed to carry out certain formalities required under section  of the Regulations and accordingly cannot claim that it is lawfully constituted under the terms of the law.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's explanations, and is of the opinion that there is no infringement of the principles of freedom of association if trade union organisations are obliged to comply with certain purely formal requirements laid down by law with respect to their Constitution. Nevertheless, as concerns requirements of substance, the Committee must re-emphasise its earlier observation to the effect that section  of the Regulations is not compatible with the terms of Convention No. , in terms of which trade unions should have the right to form such federations as they see fit, even if these federations comprise trade unions relating to different activities or in different districts.
.With regard to the control of the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua, the Government had referred in its first communication to the discovery by the labour authorities of certain irregularities in the management of these funds, as a result of which the Department of Associations had ordered that no withdrawals should be made from the Union's bank account unless the cheques were first endorsed by the Head of that Department. In its new communication the Government claims, in reply to the Committee's observation concerning the nature of this control, that it is inadmissible to doubt the honesty of the administrative authorities or to assume that it acted in bad faith. The Government further declares that the Union accepted the action taken by the Department, since it did not avail itself of its Constitutional right to apply for an injunction, and that accordingly it failed to exhaust the remedies provided for by Nicaraguan law.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's comments, and considers it pertinent to point out that it is important that control over the internal acts of a trade union should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority not only in order to ensure that it is exercised in an impartial and objective manner but also to avoid the risk of measures Of control taken by the administrative authorities appearing to be arbitrary. Furthermore, the Committee considers it necessary to re-emphasise its earlier observation to the effect that the authorisation still required by the Teachers' Union of Managua to draw on its bank accounts runs counter to the right of trade unions to organise their administration and activities.
.Lastly, as concerns the allegation relating to interference by the authorities in the establishment of new unions, concerning which the Government had failed to make any observations, the Committee takes note of the statement made by the Government in its new communication to the effect that no interference in fact occurred, but that, on the other hand, teachers who differed with the line of action taken by the Federation undertook spontaneously and on their own initiative to set up other organisations which they felt would be better fitted to defend their interests.
.In these circumstances, and as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to take note of the Government's observations with respect to the conclusions reached previously in regard to this case, and to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraph , above concerning the Constitution of federations and in paragraph  above concerning the control and management of trade union funds.
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  March  addressed direct to the Director-General of the ILO by the World Federation of Trade Unions. The complaint was communicated to the Government for observations by a letter dated  March  and these were received in a communication from the Government to the Director-General of the ILO dated  May .

.Considering, however, that the measures of suspension in question have been revoked, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, subject to what is stated in the previous paragraph, to decide that no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of this aspect of the case.
.As for the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders and militant trade unionists, analysed in paragraph  above, the Committee notes that the Government makes no reference to them in its reply.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to submit its observations concerning this aspect of the complaint, indicating, in particular, the present situation of the persons named by the WFTU.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, subject to the observations contained in paragraph  above, that the allegations relating to the suspension of legal personality of certain trade unions and the freezing of their funds do not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to submit its observations concerning the allegations of the arrest of trade union leaders and militant trade unionists indicating, in particular, the present situation of the persons named by the WFTU and mentioned in paragraph  above;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the supplementary information referred to in the previous paragraph.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1971,Colombia
2,".This case has already been examined by the Committee, at its session in February , at which time it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. The Committee's th Report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (February-March ).
.The facts of the case may be summarised as follows. The Homoeopathy Workers' Union, founded in , was duly registered by the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry of Labour after the provisions of its statutes relating to the organisation's funds had been amended in compliance with a request made by the office in question. The Union appears to have functioned normally until April , when it was informed by the Ministry that, on the basis of information furnished by the College of Physicians and Surgeons, the Ministry had made application to the courts for the Union's judicial dissolution. The information supplied by the College of Physicians and Surgeons was to the effect that up to  only three persons had been authorised by the College to practise homoeopathy in Costa Rica. Under the law of that country the practice of homoeopathy and certain other special branches of medicine is subject to such authorisation being granted.
.Furthermore, under the terms of sections  and  of the Labour Code (as amended), firstly, a workers' organisation or an organisation of persons exercising a profession independently may not be formed with fewer than  members, and, secondly, the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare is empowered to apply to the labour courts for the winding up of any occupational organisation which fails to comply with this provision. Since, according to the Government, only three medical practitioners had been authorised to practise homoeopathy, it appeared that the minimum membership requirement for the establishment of an organisation of persons practising homoeopathy independently as a profession had not been fulfilled.
.At its February  session the Committee pointed out that in many countries laws and regulations have been enacted, in the public interest, for the control of the exercise of various professional activities. Such rules, noted the Committee, are of necessity stringent in order to ensure that the general public may have adequate protection against persons who may seek to exercise professional activities without the qualifications, or authorisation by the supervisory professional body, which may be necessary before doing so. The Committee observed that in Costa Rica the medical profession is governed by laws and regulations of this kind, and that it was these provisions and the law governing the establishment of trade unions which the Government had invoked as justification for its application to the courts for the dissolution of a union consisting, apparently, of three properly qualified and duly authorised homoeopaths and a number of other persons who had not received proper authorisation to practise this branch of medicine.
.The court action brought by the Ministry being still sub judice at the time when the Committee last examined the case, the Committee, considering that the information furnished therein might be useful to it in assessing the merits of the case, recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply a copy of the judgement when it was pronounced, together with the grounds adduced therefor.
.In response to this request, which was conveyed to it on  March , the Government, by a communication dated  July , has supplied the text of the judgement pronounced by the court of first instance as well as that of the judgement pronounced on appeal.
.The judgement of the First Labour Court of San Jos orders the dissolution of the complaining organisation. The grounds adduced from this ruling are stated to be the following facts, considered to be proved: (a) that the occupational organisation known as the "" Homoeopathy Workers' Union of Costa Rica "" was registered with the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry of Labour; (b) that the College of Physicians and Surgeons objected to registration of the organisation concerned on the ground that none of the members of its executive committee was authorised to practise homoeopathy in Costa Rica under the terms of the law whereby the College was established; (c) that the statutes of the organisation in question mention, as one of its aims, "" to strive to obtain official recognition for its members in their special field, namely that of homoeopathic medicine ""; (d) that among the aims of the organisation is also to be found the fundamental intention "" to enrol all the homoeopaths in the country as members of the Union "", their admission being subject to the requirement that they "" practise within the field of activity covered by this Union "" and to the condition that "" the applicant shall be examined by a board made up of members of the Union, practising homoeopathy, in homoeopathy and such other subjects as the Executive Committee may direct, with a view to satisfying the board not only as to his knowledge of homoeopathy, but also as to his general culture ""; (e) that there exists no national or foreign instructional establishment, recognised by the Ministry of Education, which awards diplomas, decrees or certificates in homoeopathy.
.The judgement also declares that, considering that "" the situation which prevailed during the preliminary inquiries into the case has remained unchanged, as is shown by the fact that the organisation involved has not attempted to challenge the findings which were reached following the inquiries, under sections ,  and  (c) of the Labour Code, it behoves this court to dissolve the body known as the Homoeopathy Workers' Union of Costa Rica, without condemning it to pay the costs of the action "".
.On appeal, the Supreme Labour Tribunal confirmed the judgement of the court of first instance for the same reasons as those invoked by that court.
.It is clear both from the text of the judgements supplied by the Government and from the explanations given by the Government that the persons whom the complaining union claims to represent are not-with the apparent exception of three of them-entitled, under the statutory provisions in force in this respect, to practise the ancillary branch of medical science with which the present case is concerned. Moreover, since only three persons are authorised to practise homoeopathy in Costa Rica, and the law of the country requires that there be at least  in order to found a union of workers exercising a profession independently, it seems that the complaining union has not fulfilled the requirements which it must fulfil under the various national laws and regulations, taken together, in order to be eligible for recognition.
.In these circumstances, since the order for the dissolution of the union given by the competent courts does not appear to be a measure which could be considered an infringement of freedom of association, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint was contained in a communication, dated  April , addressed direct to the ILO by the Homoeopathy Workers' Union of Costa Rica. By a communication dated  June , the complainants presented further information in substantiation of their complaint. The complaint and further information having been transmitted to it, the Government communicated its observations in a letter dated  December .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  April , the complainants state that their union was founded on  October , when a request for registration was submitted to the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry of Labour. By a note dated  December  that office made an observation concerning the statutes submitted by the union and proposed that a general assembly be convened so that the statutes might be amended as regards the part relating to funds. A note dated  December  was also received from the chief of the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry, requesting the union to comply with the observations made by the Ministry concerning the amendment of the statutes.
.In a communication addressed to the Ministry, continue the complainants, the Trade Unions Office was informed of the decision of the extraordinary general assembly of the union which took place on  January . In this communication it was stressed that the recommendations of the Ministry had been observed, and that the union had proceeded to amend the statutes as required.
.On  March , state the complainants, the chief of the Trade Unions Office sent the union a note informing it of the registration of its Constitution and statutes and at the same time indicating the entry at which the union was registered (vii volume , folio , entry , dated  March , of the register of trade unions and other social organisations). In accordance with section  of the Labour Code, an extract of the registration was published in",1,1971,Costa Rica
3,"La Gaceta and the Diario Oficial three times in succession.
.In a letter dated  January , a copy of the minutes of the ordinary general meeting of the union, as well as reports concerning finance and other matters and the most recent list of members, was sent to the Trade Unions Office. A reply to this communication dated  January  was received from the chief of the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry.
.On  January , continue the complainants, the Trade Unions Office informed the union that the document relating to the assembly of the union in January  had been received, that its presentation had been approved and that it had been recorded in the registers kept for this purpose by the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry.
.The complainants add that in a note dated  April  the chief of the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry communicated to the union a copy of a letter dated  February , addressed by the Ministry to the Secretary of the College of Physicians and Surgeons, in which it was stated that the Legal Department of the Ministry, having examined the circumstances of the matter, had concluded that the Homoeopathy Workers' Union was not legally in existence and that the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry had accordingly deleted it from the register and made application to the court for its judicial dissolution.
.In a communication dated  June , the complainants state that a request was made by the union for a meeting with the Ministry of Labour so that a solution to the problem raised by the College of Physicians and Surgeons might be found. The Minister refused such a meeting on the grounds that the matter was sub judice. A further communication was sent by the union to the Minister on  April  but no reply was received.
.The complainants further allege that the union wrote to the Legal Department of the Ministry on  April , requesting information on the legal grounds upon which action for the dissolution of the union had been taken. The Ministry replied in a letter dated  May  that the union had been informed of the legal decision given on the matter by the Department in a letter dated  May .
.In support of these allegations the complainants supply copies of all the correspondence and documents referred to in the preceding paragraphs.
.The Government, in its reply dated  December , points out that the First Labour Court is at present considering the application for dissolution of the Homoeopathy Workers' Union. The Government explains that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare is empowered by sections ,  and  of the Labour Code (as amended by Act No.  of  May  and Act No.  of  August ) to apply to the courts for the winding-up of trade unions having a membership of fewer than  if they are associations of workers carrying on a trade or profession on their own account.
.The Government also refers to the Act for the foundation of the College of Physicians and Surgeons (Act No.  of  August ) and the Regulations for its administration (Act No.  of  January ). Section  of the Act of  provides that no person who has not previously registered with the College may practise medicine or surgery or any special branch thereof, and that authorisation is required from the College for the practice of other ancillary branches of medical science, including homoeopathy, except in the case of persons registered in such branches with other professional colleges. The Government adds that section  of the same Act provides that only persons registered with the College or authorised thereby may hold public office in connection with the professional practice of medicine, or branches thereof, except in the case of persons registered with other professional colleges in those branches.
.The Government states that in  the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare was notified by the College of Physicians and Surgeons that none of the members of the executive of the union in question was authorised to practise homoeopathy in conformity with the Act, and that up to  only three medical practitioners had been authorised to practise homoeopathy in Costa Rica. As far as the other branches of medicine were concerned, only the optometrists had formed their own professional college.
.Under the Regulations for the administration of the Act, continues the Government, the College of Physicians and Surgeons was the only body competent to authorise the practice of homoeopathy, and since only three persons had so far been thus authorised, no union could be formed in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. In addition, the Government draws attention to the legal provisions of the Health Code of , which makes it illegal for unauthorised persons to practise certain paramedical occupations (including homoeopathy). Under the Penal Code, the unlawful practice of medicine and related occupations is a criminal offence.
.In the light of these considerations, concludes the Government, the Ministry, exercising the powers vested in it, applied to the First Labour Court of San Jos for the winding up of the union in question. The Government adds that the union's legal advisers have lodged an objection to this application and the Court will accordingly reach such decision as it thinks appropriate. The Government concludes by stating that, in its opinion, there is not the slightest evidence of anti-union persecution.
.The Committee observes that the Homoeopathy Workers' Union, founded in , was duly registered by the Trade Unions Office of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare after compliance with the request of that office to amend the statutes concerning the matter of the funds of the union. The union appears to have functioned normally as such until April , when it was informed by the Ministry that, information having been received from the College of Physicians and Surgeons, an application had been made to the Court for its dissolution. The information supplied by the College was that up to  only three persons in Costa Rica had been authorised by the College to practise homoeopathy. Such authorisation, the Committee notes, is a requirement laid down by law for the practice of homoeopathy and certain other special branches of medicine.
.The Committee has also taken account of the provisions of sections  and  of the Labour Code (as amended) which provide that a workers' organisation, or an organisation of persons independently exercising their profession, may not be formed with fewer than  members, and also, inter alia, that in the event of non-compliance with this provision the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare shall apply to the labour courts for the winding up of such an occupational organisation. Since, the Government maintains, only three medical practitioners had been authorised to practise homoeopathy in the country, it follows that the minimum membership requirement had not been fulfilled for the establishment of an organisation of persons independently practising homoeopathy.
.In many countries there exist laws and regulations which are enacted, in the public interest, for the control of the exercise of various professional activities. Such rules are, of necessity, stringent in order to ensure that the general public may have adequate protection against persons who may seek to exercise professional activities without the qualifications or authorisation by the supervisory professional body which may be necessary before doing so. The Committee has observed that, in Costa Rica, the medical profession is governed by laws and regulations of this kind, and it is these regulations and the law governing the establishment of trade unions which the Government invokes as justification for the application to the courts for the dissolution of a union consisting, apparently, of three properly qualified and duly authorised homoeopaths and a number of other persons who have not received proper authorisation to practise this branch of medicine. The Government argues that the union is not a union constituted by at least  persons exercising their profession independently, as required under section  of the Labour Code.
.The Committee has no information before it, nor has the Government contended, that the work actually performed by those members of the union in question who, according to the Government, are not authorised to practise homoeopathy is performed in contravention of the law governing the practice of this branch of medicine. It would therefore seem that these persons are engaged in work connected with, or ancillary to, the practice of homoeopathy and that it is not considered that special authorisation is essential for this type of work. The Committee considers that such persons, provided they are legally performing activities in connection with the profession of homoeopathy, should be entitled to the protection afforded by the freedom of association Conventions.
.Furthermore, the membership requirement contained in section  of the Labour Code is applicable not only to organisations of persons independently exercising a profession, but also to organisations of workers in general. According to the information supplied",0,1971,Costa Rica
4,"by the Government, this provision would appear to be interpreted in such a manner as to place a restriction on the forming of an occupational organisation consisting both of independent professionals and of employees (trabajadores) as defined in section  of the Labour Code, despite the fact that they all exercise functions in the same occupational sphere. Such a restriction would, in the opinion of the Committee, constitute an infringement of Article  of Convention No. , which guarantees to workers, without distinction whatsoever, the right to establish and to join organisations of their own choosing.
.In view of the lack of information as to the membership of the union in question and the actual work performed by the persons involved in the union, the Committee is at present unable to arrive at any definitive conclusions concerning the complaint.
.The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above;(b) to request the Government to supply detailed information, at an early date, as to the membership of the Homoeopathy Workers' Union and the actual work performed by the persons involved in that union;(c) to request the Government to supply copies of the judgement of the First Labour Court of San Jos concerning the application for dissolution of the Homoeopathy Workers' Union, together with the grounds adduced therefor; and(d) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when the information requested in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of the: present paragraph has been received.",0,1971,Costa Rica
5,"be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned may participate at every stage, and that the awards given should be in all cases binding on both parties. In the present case the Committee observes that public servants do not have the right to strike, this being specifically prohibited by section  of the Labour Code. The same section, however, provides, inter alia, for the hearing and settlement of disputes, in the case of public officials, by labour courts. The Committee, accordingly, does not consider that trade union rights have been infringed in this respect.
.As regards those teachers who are not in the employment of the State, the right to strike is not precluded, but the legislation provides for conciliation and arbitration procedures which must be exhausted before strike action can be taken (section  et seq. of the Labour Code). The Committee has, in a number of cases, recognised that prior notification to the administrative authority and provision for compulsory conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before calling a strike are provided for in the laws or regulations of a substantial number of countries and that reasonable provisions of this type cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association. Since, in the present case, the stoppage of work appears to have been declared without the conciliation and arbitration procedures having been exhausted, the Committee also considers that there has been no infringement of freedom of association.
.With regard to the composition of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, the Committee notes that, by virtue of section  of the Trade Union Regulations, the establishment of federations by unions in different departments is prohibited. The Committee considers that such a provision constitutes a restriction of the right of workers' organisations to establish federations and Confederations, recognised by Article  of Convention No. . In this connection the Committee recalls the importance that should be attached to the principle, laid down in Article  of Convention No. , that workers shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing, a principle that implies for the organisations themselves the right to establish and join federations and Confederations of their own choosing s (Articles  and  of the Convention). The Committee therefore considers that the conditions laid down by law for the organisation of federations are incompatible with these standards, which include the right of trade unions to form such federations as they see fit.
.As regards the allegation that the Ministry of Labour intervened, following a request by members of the Union, to audit and freeze the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua, the Committee has, in a number of cases, stated that the principles established in Article  of Convention No.  do not prevent the control of the internal acts of a trade union if those internal acts violate the law; at the same time the law of the land must not be such as to infringe the principles on freedom of association. The Committee has also considered that it is of the greatest importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, this control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority, The Committee has also recalled that measures of supervision over the administration of trade unions, even if it is said that they are intended to protect the members of the trade union themselves against mismanagement of their funds, may, in certain cases, entail a danger of interference by the public authorities in the administration of trade unions, and that this interference may be of such a nature as to restrict the rights of organisations or impede the lawful exercise thereof, contrary to Convention No. . It may be considered, nevertheless, that there is a certain measure of guarantee against such interference where the official appointed to exercise supervision enjoys some degree of independence of the administrative authorities and where he is himself subject to the control of the judicial authorities. The Committee considers, in the present case, that the measures taken with regard to the funds of the trade union concerned do not conform to these principles. In addition, the Committee notes from the information supplied that the Teachers' Trade Union of Managua is still unable to draw upon its bank accounts without the express authorisation of the Director of Associations of the Ministry of Labour. The Committee considers that such interference by the authorities runs counter to the right of trade unions to organise their administration and activities.
.The Committee further notes that no information is supplied by the Government in connection with the allegation that the authorities intervened in elections and meetings of teachers' trade unions and that puppet trade unions were set up which teachers were forced to join. In this connection the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance it attaches to the standards set by Article  of Convention No. , whereby governments are required to take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that workers and employers may freely exercise the right to organise, and by Article  of Convention No. , which provides that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.In all these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note that the trade union leaders Leopoldo Montenegro Lara, Juan Alberto Henrique Oporta and Silvia Villagrasa Gutirrez were released after having been brought to trial and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the right to strike of teachers, to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraphs  and  above, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(c) with regard to the composition of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the legislation in force is incompatible with the right of trade unions to establish federations of their own choosing;(d) with regard to the allegation that the Ministry of Labour seized control of the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua, to draw the Government's attention to the principle that control over the internal acts of a trade union should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority, or by a person who enjoys some degree of independence of the administrative authorities and who is himself subject to the control of the judicial authorities, and to point out that the authorisation still required by the Teachers' Union of Managua to draw on its bank accounts runs counter to the right of trade unions to organise their administration and activities;(e) with regard to the allegation concerning interference by the authorities in the establishment of new unions, to draw the attention of the Government to the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom; and(f) to invite the Government to revise the legislation concerning trade unions in the light of the above considerations, and to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to the present case.",0,1971,Nicaragua
6,"to violate the rights of workers in Bolivia. The complainants point out that a few days previously, three representatives of the Confederation of Manufacturing Workers of Bolivia who had been invited by the complainants to attend a seminar for the River Plate Basin in Buenos Aires were arrested at La Paz airport by police and armed forces. The complainants add that there is a continually growing list of trade union leaders and members held in concentration camps in the interior of the country and that many are tortured, murdered, abducted without trace, or exiled.
.In the further communication dated  December  the complainants state that at the Sixth Latin American Congress of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions, held in Caracas from  to  November , lists were drawn up of trade union leaders deprived of their liberty in Bolivia. According to the complainants these lists are based on reliable information collected from within the country. Copies of the said lists are supplied by the complainants. These lists contain the names of the following  trade union leaders, who are stated to have been deprived of their liberty: Juvenal Garabito (Cochabamba), Carmelo Andrade (""Presencia"" newspaper), Jacinto Quispe (General Secretary, ASIB), Roberto Moreira (court employee), Erasmo Barrios Villa (Potosi University Workers), Luis Pearanda (executive, Press Federation), Rodolfo Brum (Nueva Amrica Radio), Victor Michel (delegate, Huanuni Assembly), Angel Astete (Secretary, Miners' Cultural Association, San Florencio), Julin Jimnez (Colquiri Miners' Association), Juan Flores (Relations Secretary, Federation of Manufacturing Workers, La Paz), Patricio Cuentos (Secretary, Disputes Section, Federation of Manufacturing Workers, La Paz), Pedro Cruz (Disputes Secretary, State Teachers' Union, Huanuni Mine, Oruro), and Lindo Fernndez, David Quinez and Ren Higueras (Bolivian Workers' Confederation-COB). In addition, the complainants supply a list of women whom they allege to have been imprisoned. This list includes the names of Edmy Alvarez Daza, a leader of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, and Enma de Bacarreza, leader of the La Paz Teachers' Union. The complainants state that the house of the latter was searched and that she was taken to the Ministry of the Interior to make statements. This, continued the complainants, lasted several days, during which time her house was under police surveillance.
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that, following the coup d'tat of October , the Government of General Torres Gonzlez was forced by extreme left-wing parties to follow a policy which bred fear and insecurity in all sectors of the country. A number of extremist agitators made their way into the Bolivian workers' movement, which had achieved much in the past.
.The Government claims that all workers' organisations enjoy every guarantee towards their development but that some leaders had compromised themselves politically with the government which was deposed in August , by substituting political activities for trade union activities. These few trade union leaders, on  August in Santa Cruz, and on  August in La Paz, distributed arms to workers and students whom they had incited against their own brothers.
.The Government also states that the free functioning of the following organisations is proof that freedom of association is observed: the Confederation of Manufacturing Workers of Bolivia, with  member unions; the Trade Union Federation of Railway Workers, with  member unions; the Confederation of Bank Employees and Allied workers, with  member unions; the Trade Union Federation of Drivers of Bolivia, with  member unions; the Trade Union Federation of Construction Workers, with  member unions; the Trade Union Confederation of Municipal workers, with  member unions; and the National Federation of Mineworkers with  member unions. Altogether, the Government states,  Confederations,  federations,  trade unions and other organisations are functioning normally.
.The Government adds that the small number of former trade union leaders who were arrested when it was proved that they had been involved in activities against the security of the State have been released, and that others will be tried before the ordinary courts s
.It also states that the aim of the labour policy of the Government is the independence of the Bolivian workers' movement and that there is no justification for any state intervention in the internal affairs of trade unions provided that they are not misled by anarchists.
.In its communication of  May  the Government emphasises that it respects and guarantees the independence of workers' organisations and the free exercise of trade union rights and that seven Confederations and forty federations are operating normally and that no strikes have taken place for seven months. The Government supplies a list of organisations which have re-elected their officers since  August .
.The Governing Body drew the attention of the Government to the rule which it had followed in a number of cases', namely that where allegations are made that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amount to general denials of the allegations or are simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security, or for crimes under ordinary law, the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings, in order that a proper examination may be made of the allegations. Accordingly, the Government has been repeatedly requested to supply detailed information concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against the trade union leaders in question, as well as the text of the sentences and the grounds adduced therefor. This information has not been received.
.At its session in May , the Committee addressed an urgent appeal to the Government to supply this information. This appeal having proved fruitless, the Committee, at its session in November , and by virtue of the procedure set forth in paragraph  of its th Report, informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the matter at the Committee's present session, even if the information requested from the Government had still not been received. So far the information requested has not been received.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observations made by the Committee as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part should recognise the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to recall that in all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official, the Committee and the Governing Body, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, have considered that it was incumbent upon the government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned;(c) to recall that in cases of this kind, the Committee and the Governing Body have reached the conclusion that allegations relating to the arrest, detention or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further examination only after considering observations from the governments showing with sufficient detail that the measures were in no way occasioned by the exercise of trade union freedoms but by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature;(d) to draw attention to the principle that it should be the policy of every government to ensure observance of the rights of man and, especially, of the right of all detained or accused persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment;(e) to deplore the fact that despite the repeated requests the Government has not submitted the information sought, thereby making it impossible for the Committee to formulate its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts;(f) to request the Director-General to maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain information concerning the situation of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraphs  and  above who were arrested.
.This case was examined by the Committee at its session in February-March , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report, which is contained in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's th Report.
.At its session in June  the Committee, having noted that the Government had not yet supplied the information or observations which it had been requested to supply, adjourned its examination of the case.
.In a communication dated  May , addressed direct to the ILO, the Government transmitted certain observations in connection with the trade union situation in Bolivia.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the",0,1971,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
7,".The complaint of the Latin American Federation of Transport Workers is contained in a communication dated  July , addressed direct to the ILO. This complaint was transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations thereon in a communication dated  August .
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that one of their affiliates, the Union of Drivers of Colombia (UNITRASCOL), has been refused legal recognition by the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. It is further stated that at the time the complaint was lodged, the file containing the application for the granting of legal recognition to the Union of Drivers of Colombia had been awaiting action for more than five months.
.In its observations, the Government states that legal personality was granted to the Union of Drivers of Colombia by virtue of Resolution No.  of  August .
.While unaware of the reasons for the delay, the Committee notes that six months elapsed between the submission by the union concerned of the application for legal personality and the granting of such personality. The Committee points out in this connection that while it is true that the founders of a trade union must comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such nature as to hamper freedom to form organisations.
.Subject to the reservation expressed in the preceding paragraph, the Committee, noting that the situation out of which the complaint arose has been dealt with, considers that it would be pointless for it to pursue the matter further and accordingly recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",0,1971,Colombia
8,"the Governing Body stressed that the miners' broadcasting stations should be rapidly returned to the workers and their organisations.
.The Committee and the Governing Body also noted the new measures as a result of which some trade unionists - arrested or exiled as a result of the events in the mining industry - had been released or had been able to return to the country. They requested the Government to continue its re-examination of the situation of the other workers and trade union leaders still under arrest or exiled.
.In a more recent complaint dated  June  (with which the WFTU associated itself), the Miners' Trade Unions International referred to the detention of Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, who was said to be undergoing torture, as a result of which his health had seriously deteriorated. He was allegedly incarcerated in the prison belonging to the Department of Public Order (DOP) in La Paz. The complainants demanded that he be released, along with the many other mining trade unionists who were in prison, and that a stop be put to the repression directed against the miners who had been calling for better living and working conditions.The latest observations from the Government
.The Government stated in its letter of  August  that Mario Cortez had been released in May ; it added that while he was in custody he was in good health, and that the Government had no knowledge of any subsequent illness. His detention had nothing to do with trade union matters, but was due to the political work of subversive agitation in which Mario Cortez had been engaged in the mines.
.In its telegram of  October , the Government supplied a further list of mineworkers who had been arrested on political grounds, according to the Government, and had now been released:Roberto Acho Huarita; Juan Alfaro Moreira; Jaime Bernal Alvarado; Alberto Camacho Pardo; Gregorio Colque Capacalle; Mario Cortez Cabrere (see preceding paragraph); Simn Chumacero Facio; Freddy Ferrufino Guzmn; Isaac Gonzlez Cabezas; Manuel Hernndez Veizaga; Armando Iporre Zegarra; Hugo Marne Terrazas; Severo Mendoza Chino; Adolfo Morales Gmez; Victor Orellana Hinojosa; Paulino Palma Lpez (since rearrested, however); Serafn Ramos Quiroz; Gonzal Rivas Mercado; Fabian Romero Gmez; Delfn Saldano Hidaldo; Teodoro Sarmiento Choque; Hugo Serrano Sanjinez; Efran Velasco Gutirrez; Milan Velasquez Jauregui; Germn Zambrana Serrudo; Wilfredo Zambrana Serrudo.The Government also mentioned the names of five trade union leaders or workers in the mining sector who had been able to return from exile. The Committee notes that this latter information has already been transmitted in earlier communications.
.In more general terms, the Government referred, in its communication of  October , to a speech made on  July  by the President of the Republic before the Supreme Court. He stated that the Government was preparing for Bolivia's return to a Constitutional regime, which would enable the country to accede, through the free expression of the will of the people, to a qualitatively more advanced level. Before returning to a Constitutional regime in the strict sense of the term, during  and  the country would have to go through what might be termed the institutionalisation phase: the people would be consulted with a view to introducing into the national Constitution amendments reflecting the new realities in the country and the prospects opening up as a result. Once these reforms had been approved by the people, continued the Head of State, Constitutional government would be restored in ; nothing could alter that decision. The Government added that the adoption and implementation of new trade union legislation were comprised in the measures to be adopted very shortly as part of the process leading up to the country's return to a Constitutional regime.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its regret that, notwithstanding the time which has elapsed, the principles and standards of freedom of association freely subscribed by Bolivia are still not observed in Bolivia, and to appeal to the Government to re-establish as a matter of urgency, both in law and in practice, the conditions indispensable to the carrying on of normal trade union activity in Bolivia;(b) to note with interest the release of a certain number of mineworkers, including Mario Cortez, Permanent Secretary of the FSTMB, but to urge the Government to continue its review of the situation as concerns the other workers and trade union leaders mentioned in paragraph  as being still under arrest or in exile;(c) in broader terms, to suggest that the Government envisage the possibility of granting an amnesty to the other trade union leaders in exile;(d) to request the Government once again to ensure the rapid return of the miners' radio stations to the workers;(e) to request the Government to communicate, by  February  at the latest, information on any developments in connection with the matters raised in the preceding clauses, and to take note in the meantime of this interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, chairman.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in February , November  and February .It submitted to the Governing Body two interim reports and a final report which are set out in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its rd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report.
.In its nd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain information concerning the situation of a number of trade unionists who had been arrested. Despite repeated measures, this information had not been received. The Committee, therefore, addressed requests to the Government in May , November , February  and May  that it provide the information requested. This matter is also covered partly by the complaint regarding failure by Bolivia to respect the provisions of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), presented under article  of the ILO Constitution by certain delegates at the th Session () of the International Labour Conference, regarding which the officers of the Governing Body submitted a report to the Governing Body at its th Session (November ). The Government finally submitted information in a letter of  September , which also refers to the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.Regarding Cases Nos. ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: two, dated  February  and  July , from the Latin American Central of Workers; three, dated  February ,  June and  July , from the International Federation of Teachers' Unions; two, dated  November  and  March , from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions; two, dated  November  and  July , from the world Federation of Trade Unions; four, dated  November and  December  and  February and  August , from the World Confederation of Labour; one, dated  November , from the Inter-American Regional Organisation of workers; and a communication of  January  sent jointly by the Bolivian Central of Workers and the Bolivian Miners' Trade Union Federation.
.The complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, for its observations. Despite the time which had elapsed since the submission of the first complaints and despite the seriousness of the allegations, the Government submitted in its communications of  June and  October  only very partial information on one of the many allegations made by the complainants. Consequently, the Committee sent an urgent request to the Government in May  to provide the information requested (Cases Nos.  and ). The Government provided this information in communications of  May and  June  (whose text was identical),  June and  and  September .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.This case was examined by the Committee at its sessions in February-March and November , on which occasions it submitted to the Governing Body interim reports which are found at paragraphs  to  of the th Report and at paragraphs  to  of the rd Report of the Committee respectively.
.The complaint of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  October  addressed direct to the ILO. In a further communication dated  December  the complainants submitted additional information in support of the complaint.
.The complaint and additional information were transmitted to the Government, which communicated its observations thereon in letters dated  January and  May .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  October  the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions states that the Government continues",0,1971,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
9,".The Committee examined this case at its March  Session, when it submitted to the Governing Body a report, contained in its th Report, in which it recommended the Governing Body, in accordance with established procedure, to examine this report at its th Session (- June ). However, at its June  Session, the Governing Body decided to postpone its examination of the case since a communication, dated  January , had been received from the complainant organisation containing further information on the matter, and since another communication had been received from the World Confederation of Labour, requesting that the case be brought once more before the Committee.
.The new communication from the CLAT was transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations on  February .
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The original complaint from the CLAT was made in a telegram dated  November . The telegram was transmitted to the Government, which submitted its observations in a communication dated  December , confirmed by a communication dated  January .
.The complainants had alleged that the Government of Colombia ""categorically prohibited"" the holding of the Sixth Congress of the CLASC in Colombia and requested the ILO to intervene to clarify the attitude of the Colombian Government, which constituted ""a serious threat to the rights of the workers"".
.In its reply, the Government maintained that it had at no time refused the CLASC permission to meet in Bogot. It explained that it was not possible to meet the request for authorisation to hold the Congress, the request having been made by an organisation - the General Confederation of Labour - which was not entitled to make it since it dial not enjoy legal personality. The Government went on to say that, in order to overcome this legal obstacle, it had supported the suggestion made by the President of the General Confederation of Labour that the Congress should be held under the auspices of the Trade Union Movement of Antioquia; this suggestion, however, was not taken up. Finally, the Government stated that it was not in a position to grant the considerable financial assistance requested to organise the Congress, partly because it had insufficient budgetary funds for this purpose and partly because it was impossible to make budgetary transfers when the General Confederation of Labour was not a legally recognised organisation.
.With its reply the Government enclosed the text of a communication sent from the Minister of Labour to Mr. Jairo Gutirrez, President of the General Confederation of Labour (and, in his capacity as President of the Sixth CLASC Congress, co-signatory of the complaint).
.In this communication, the Minister states the following: ""In your capacity as President of the trade union organisation known as the General Confederation of Labour, you inform us that the 'Sixth Continental Congress of Workers of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) will be held in Bogota from  to  November next. In your communication ... you add that the organisation of this congress would cost approximately  million Colombian pesos, which is why, on behalf of the General Confederation of Labour, you request the President of the Republic to examine the possibility of giving you immediate financial assistance ( million pesos) for the said international congress. In making this request for financial assistance, you write: Realising, as we do, the financial difficulties encountered by ministries at the end of each financial year, we respectfully request you to authorise a transfer if your own Ministry has no available credits'.""
.""In reply to your request"" the minister of Labour goes on ""I would point out that the Head of the Departmental Division for Labour and Social Security of Antioquia ... sent to the office of the Chief of the Collective Relations Division of this ministry documentation concerning the formation of a third-degree trade union organisation known as the General Confederation of Labour, with headquarters in Bogot, and active throughout the country. The said documentation was studied by the Trade Union Regulations and Registration Section of the Collective Labour Relations Division of this Ministry and as a result of this study a number of irregularities came to light which prevented the continuation of the procedure provided for in Chapter III of Title I of the Labour Code. In view of these irregularities, the Head of the Trade Union Regulations and Registration Section of this ministry, after making a careful study in accordance with the provisions of the Labour code, drew up the following memorandum on the matter: the documentation in question is to be returned through the Departmental Division for Labour and Social Security of Antioquia so that the persons concerned may correct the errors that have been noted in the matter from the legal point of view.""
.""The above explanation"" the Minister continues necessarily leads to the conclusion that the General Confederation of Labour is an organisation that is in the process of applying for recognition of legal personality, which means that it does not enjoy all the rights conferred by law on legally recognised associations of workers. Consequently, in accordance with section  of the Labour code, until the administrative document recognising the legal personality and approving the statutes of the organisation has been drawn up, the latter cannot act as an organisation of workers or carry out the corresponding functions or exercise the rights accorded to a workers' association.""
.""Moreover"" the Minister's communication goes on ""section  of Decree No.  of  January , which replaced section  of Executive Decree No.  of  September , provides that in, order for one or more Confederations to convene a trade union congress, the Confederation (or Confederations) must be functioning legally and normally at the time, a requirement which, as already stated, is not yet met by the General Confederation of Labour. From the foregoing it follows that, for the time being, the General Confederation of Labour is not legally entitled to promote, organise or hold a congress on the scale planned since it is not yet a third-degree trade union organisation recognised as such by the national Government, and representing part of the Colombian working class.""
.The communication from the Minister goes on in the following terms: ""As regards the request for financial assistance to organise the international trade union congress as planned, our administration, despite its obligation (stipulated in section  of the Labour Code) to promote the holding of trade union congresses, deems it advisable, in accordance with the appropriate regulations, to inform you that it is not in a position to supply the sum requested since, apart from not having such an amount available under the budget, it could not legally arrange for a transfer of funds to promote a congress administered or organised by a body which, since it is now in the process of being constituted, lacks the legal personality which would be essential to justify a payment for which no provision had been made in the national budget.""
.""Nevertheless"" the minister's communication concludes ""despite the legal and financial obstacles mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, I take this opportunity to state that the national Government would be perfectly willing for the international trade union meeting that has been planned to be held under the direct responsibility of the Trade Union Action Movement of Antioquia, as you so rightly suggested in your message of  October . In this way, the country would be the scene of a trade union congress which, by the nature of its participants, their representative character and the variety of regions from which they would come, would be a milestone in the history of Colombian trade unionism; it would correspond exactly with one of the essential principles of the social policy embarked upon by the national Government, which is to promote the exercise of the Constitutional right of association and, consequently, the exercise of the powers which our legislation confers on the trade union organisations of the Republic with a view to ensuring the maintenance of social peace as the foundation of the nation's progress.""
.When it considered the information at its disposal, at its March  Session, the Committee deduced that the request to hold the Sixth CLASC Congress in Bogot had been made by a national Colombian organisation which was in the process of being constituted and which, consequently, did not at that time enjoy legal personality. Under Colombian law, in order for a Confederation to organise a congress, it must at the time of convening the congress be functioning ""legally and normally"". The Committee pointed out that the General Confederation of Labour appeared to have been aware of this legal obstacle that prevented it from organising the congress itself since - as the Government stated - it had suggested that the congress should be organised under the auspices of the Trade Union Action Movement of Antioquia which, unlike the Confederation, enjoyed legal personality. The",0,1971,Colombia
10,"Committee also indicated that, far from objecting to this proposal the Government had appeared to be wholeheartedly in favour of it and that it was not known why this solution was not finally adopted.
.In view of the foregoing, the Committee considered that it had not been established that the holding of the Sixth Congress of the CLASC in Bogot had been forbidden by the Colombian authorities, and recommended the Governing Body to decide that the case called for no further examination on its part.
.As indicated above, further information having been received, the Governing Body decided to postpone its examination of the case.
.In its communication of  March , the CLAT sends a detailed account of the events, which is summarised hereafter. More than  unions, enjoying legal personality and affiliated to five regional and national federations (likewise enjoying legal status) supported the holding of the Sixth Congress of the Latin American: Federation of Christian Trade Unions in Bogot in November , as had been decided in October  by the Twelfth Latin American Council of Workers. Other large Colombian trade unions that are not members of the CLASC were also in favour of the congress being held. On  May  five trade union federations with legal personality and seven regional trade union Committees, as well as  unions, formed the General Confederation of Labour, which became a member of the World Confederation of Labour and of the CLASC. The General Confederation of Labour (CGT), together with other trade union organisations, set up fifteen working parties to make preparations for the Sixth Congress under instructions from the organising Committee of the CLASC. Between  and  August  a CLASC delegation, accompanied by Jairo Gutirrez, President of the CGT went to see various Colombian authorities to inform them of the decision to hold the Sixth CLASC Congress in Colombia, to find out what legal formalities had to be complied with and to request the Government to make the appropriate facilities available to them.
.The complainants go on to say that they had received a telegram stating that the President of the Republic had granted an audience to the delegation which was confirmed twenty-four hours before the appointed time. However, when the members of the delegation presented themselves for the appointment, they were informed that the President could not receive them for serious reasons of State. They were able to see the President's General Secretary, the Minister of Labour, the Vice-Minister of Labour and the General Secretary and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the absence of the Minister. All these persons stated that the Government could make all the appropriate facilities available for the holding of the Congress. One month later, on  September , at the insistence of the CGT, the President's General Secretary sent the following cable: ""What the Government can and will do is to afford you every guarantee for the meeting of the Sixth CLASC Congress, which must naturally take place in strict conformity with the law.""
.At the same time, the complainants continue, the General Secretary and Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, in the course of a telephone conversation with the President of the CGT, informed the latter that he had issued instructions for the visas required by the delegates of certain countries to enter Colombia to be granted. Subsequently, on  October , the President of the CGT was informed that instructions had been given to the Bogota Customs Administration to authorise entry of the documents, books, etc. to be distributed among participants at the Congress, once they had been duly checked and evaluated. The Chairman was required to undertake to supply the Customs, after the Congress, with a signed statement to the effect that the material in question had in fact been distributed to the participants.
.The complainants state that the organising Committee for the Congress, examining the cable from the President's General Secretary and observing that there was a state of emergency in Colombia (making it impossible for meetings to be held without prior permission from the military authorities), realised that although they had been offered guarantees, in fact the laws in force prevented the holding of the Congress. According to the complainants, despite the fact that the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs had stated that the visas would be granted, the subordinate officials of his Ministry did not issue them. Furthermore, the complainants maintain that the customs procedures proved more of a hindrance than a help as regards the entry of the documents.
.Faced with this situation, the complainants continue, in the second week of October a deputation made up of a CLASC leader and Colombian trade union leaders went to see the President's General Secretary, who, instead of receiving them, sent a message to the effect that ""the Government was studying the situation"". The Chief of the Visa Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that he had been given orders not to grant the visas. The deputation requested an interview with the General Secretary and, Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, who did not wish to receive them and stated that he had already given orders for the visas to be granted. When the members of the deputation insisted further, the General Secretary finally received them and it was then that they were told that the Government had given orders that the Congress was, not to be held. The vice-Minister of Labour informed them that there were obstacles to the holding of the Congress because of pressure from outside. Finally, the President of the CGT and the deputation were personally informed that the Government would not allow the Congress to be held, that foreign delegates could not enter the country and that the law respecting states of emergency would be applied.
.The complainants conclude by saying that the CGT had never requested permission to organise the Congress, that it had never stated that a meeting of the CGT was at issue, that at all times it had been clearly stated that it was to be a CLASC Congress and that it is totally unjustified to maintain that permission to hold the Congress was refused because the CGT did not enjoy legal status, since the CGT was acting only as an organisation backing the Congress.
.In its reply respecting this communication from the CLAT, the Government states that the chronological account is presented without proof and takes no account of the legal system of Colombia or anything relating to the national interests. The Government states that it had no wish to refuse permission for the Congress to be held and that the CLASC deputation was received by various authorities. However, attention was drawn to the fact that the Congress was expected to take place in strict accordance with the law. The Government goes on to state that at the time there was a state of emergency in Colombia and that, in accordance with the Constitution and the laws in force, it was the responsibility of the Government to take all necessary measures for the maintenance of law and order. Consequently, the Government could postpone or suspend any meeting, including those of assemblies and councils at departmental or municipal level, if this was deemed necessary in the national interest. The Government did not refuse permission for the Congress to be held but it was considered inadvisable during the state of emergency. During a state of emergency the law makes no exception for trade union meetings and one cannot speak of condemning a government that is acting lawfully in considering that it must prohibit a meeting during a state of emergency.
.The Government concludes by saying that freedom of association and trade union rights have not been trampled underfoot. The interests of law and order come first among the Government's priorities. ""When the Constitution provides that there are limits to the right of assembly during a state of emergency, it is not because Colombia alone has decided to establish this system; it is a situation encountered in all countries governed by laws and other legal institutions.""
.In view of this fresh information, the Committee observes that the steps taken in preparing for the Sixth Congress of the CLASC appear to have met with varying success, alternating from support by various national authorities to the final ban on the Congress. Initially the representatives of the CLASC and the President of the CLAT were received by the authorities, who assured them that the Government would facilitate the holding of the Congress. Difficulties appear to have arisen from October  onwards, particularly as concerns the granting of visas to foreign delegates and with regard to the CGT because of its lack of legal status. Finally, the holding of the Congress was banned. From the information supplied by the Government it now appears that at one time the latter was in favour of the Congress, although it had not agreed to this being organised by the CGT (because of the latter's lack of legal status); however in its latest communication the Government states that",0,1971,Colombia
11,"the Congress was banned since it was considered inadvisable to hold it during a state of emergency. Consequently, although the Congress would have been organised under the auspices of another organisation (with legal status), it could not have been held because of a decision taken by the authorities as a result of the state of emergency.
.The Committee has stated on several occasions that measures of a purely political nature, such as a state of emergency, are matters which are outside the Committee's terms of reference except in so far as they may have an effect on trade union rights, In this case the effect has been to restrict the right of assembly of an international trade union organisation. There is no doubt that a government can restrict the right of assembly in general, including that of trade unions, during a state of emergency so as to safeguard law and order. Nevertheless, in the present case, the Government's position as regards the reasons for which the Sixth Congress of the CLASC was banned is not entirely clear. The state of emergency appears to have been declared on  February , which means that it was already in force when the first steps were taken with a view to the holding of the Congress; it was, however, given as the reason for banning the Congress only at the last minute, when little time was left, in November . Another matter that is not very clear is why the CLASC persisted in its efforts concerning the holding of the Congress in Colombia when it knew that a state of emergency was in force.
.As the Committee has stated in a previous case, trade union meetings of an international nature may give rise to special problems, not only because of the nationality of the participants but also in connection with the international policy and commitments of the country in which the meeting is to take place. In this connection the government of a particular country might consider it necessary to adopt restrictive measures on the grounds of certain special circumstances prevailing at a particular time. Such measures might be justified in exceptional cases, in view of specific situations and provided they conformed to the laws of the country. However, it should never be possible to apply measures of a general nature against particular trade union organisations unless, in each case, sufficient grounds existed to justify the government decision - such as dangers that might arise in the field of the international relations of a State or public safety and order. Otherwise the right of assembly, the exercise of which by international organisations should also be recognised, would be seriously restricted.
.In these circumstances, subject to the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and , to which it wishes to draw attention, and taking account of the fact that the Sixth CLASC Congress has meanwhile been held in another country, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case calls for no further examination.",0,1971,Colombia
12,"and to request the Government to indicate whether any judicial guarantees accompanied the dissolution of the union in question and, since the exceptional situation that had arisen now appears to be at an end, whether the union was reconstituted or under what conditions it may be reconstituted.
.The Committee has also noted the Government's statement that the restrictive measures taken regarding broadcasting stations, television and other means of communication bear no relation to labour matters. In this connection the Committee has, in previous cases, taken the view that the publication and distribution of news and information of general or special interest to trade unions and their members constitutes a legitimate trade union activity and the application of measures for the control of publication and information may involve a serious interference by the administrative authorities with such activity. In such cases the exercise of administrative authority should be subject to judicial review at the earliest possible moment. However, since the restrictions imposed by the Government appear to have been of a temporary nature and confined to the dissemination of information concerning the illegal strike, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw attention to the principle that the prohibition of strikes by reason of their non-occupational character, or where they have been designed to coerce a government with respect to a political matter, or where the strike was directed against a government's policy and was not in furtherance of a trade dispute, does not constitute an infringement of trade union rights;(b) with regard to the restrictions imposed by the Government on the dissemination of information by the broadcasting stations, television and other means, to draw the attention of the Government to the principle set forth in paragraph  hereof, and to decide, for the reasons given in that paragraph, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(c) to draw attention to the principle set out in paragraph  above and to request the Government to supply information as full and precise as possible concerning the measures which were taken as regards the trade union leaders who are alleged to have been imprisoned;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle expressed in paragraph  above and to request the Government to indicate whether any judicial guarantees accompanied the dissolution of the National Union of Ecuadorian Social Security Workers and whether the union was reconstituted or under what conditions it may be reconstituted; and(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will supply a further report to the Governing Body when it has received the information requested from the Government in accordance with subparagraphs (c) and (d) above.",0,1971,Ecuador

.In conclusion, the complainants state that, since  July , warrants have been issued by the Government for the arrest of all the leaders of the United Workers' Front, who are working clandestinely. Decree No. -A has not been repealed and employers are still taking advantage of its provisions to dismiss workers on the pretext that they are "" planning a subversive strike "". The complainants add that the departments of the Ministry of Labour are forbidden by government orders to deal with any request from any trade union organisation which is affiliated to the United Workers' Front.
.In its communication dated  October , the World Confederation of Labour states that it associates itself fully with the complaint submitted by the CLASC and calls upon the ILO to investigate the situation in Ecuador concerning the enjoyment of freedom of association and trade union rights generally. In its further communication addressed to the United Nations, the WCL formulates the same allegations set out in the preceding paragraphs.
.In its communications dated  November and  December  and  January , the Government contests the allegations and states that these are politically motivated attacks having no bearing upon matters of freedom of association. These attacks, states the Government, constitute an "" intolerable interference in the internal politics of the country "" and clearly reveal the spirit which moved the complainants to submit their allegations.
.Of the  points contained in the "" Programme of Action "" only two, states the Government, related to labour matters, the other  concerning university autonomy and other matters. The Government was under no obligation to yield to such demands, and did not do so. It was wrong to allege that the Government's refusal to meet these demands meant, as stated by the complainants, that the Government was shirking the obligations by which it was bound. Furthermore, it would not have been possible for any government to accede immediately to such demands of the workers as rises in wages and salaries, drastic land reforms, etc., without careful study of the possible consequences.
.The whole purpose of the national strike called for  and  July was, according to the Government, to bring about the downfall of the Government and, in fact, the vast majority of the workers had refused to participate in this strike. Moreover, continues the Government, the strike was illegal since it was not organised according to the procedure laid down in sections  et seq. of the Labour Code. The workers' demands were not submitted to a labour inspector, as provided for by law, but directly to the President of the Republic. The Government was accordingly obliged to take steps to end this unlawful action.
.In order to meet the emergency thus created, the Government issued Decree No. -A of  July , which authorised employers to request the labour authorities to grant them the right to terminate the employment of workers participating in the illegal strike. Once the emergency was over, however, Decree No.  was issued on  August  authorising the labour authorities to verify and review any action taken by employers under Decree No. -A. It was not necessary, the Government states, to repeal formally Decree No. -A since it was enforceable only for the duration of the strike. The Decree's exceptional character did not give rise to any change in the Labour Code and did not affect the principles of freedom of association and the right to strike, which are recognised so far as they remain within the framework of the law. The total number of dismissals for the country as a whole was ,  per cent of whom returned to work, while a few of the remainder received compensation for wrongful dismissal.
.As regards the National Union of Ecuadorian Social Security Workers, which, according to the Government, was one of the unions most actively concerned in the strike, the Government explains that this organisation forfeited its legal status by having neither confined itself to activities in pursuit of its stated aims nor respected the law of the land. The Government was accordingly obliged to decree its dissolution. The Government adds that, as a conciliatory gesture, it ordered the reinstatement of all the social security workers who had been dismissed. In this connection, the Government transmits a press cutting indicating the satisfaction expressed by these employees for this action to the President of the Republic and to the Minister of Social Welfare and Labour. The Government states that the National Association of Ecuadorian Social Security Workers, which confined itself to its proper objectives, encountered no difficulties and continued to function normally.
.The supervision of radio and television stations, states the Government, was essential because of the political emergency, and had nothing to do with freedom of association.
.With regard to the closing of the Seventh Latin American Social Security Conference, the Government indicates that this measure was taken because of interference in matters of internal national policy in which aliens enjoying the hospitality of the Republic are not permitted to indulge under the terms of the Constitution and the law.
.The Government states in addition that the leaders of the United Workers' Front are received at the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare for the settlement of trade disputes and other problems affecting the workers and, in fact, have preferential treatment in the daily negotiations on the many problems connected with collective labour disputes. What is more, states the Government, the leaders of the Confederation of Workers in Ecuador (CTE) and the Ecuadorian Confederation of Christian Workers (CEDOC) had recently, and publicly, expressed their support for the Minister of Labour, who had been attacked by certain employers. The leaders of these organisations, as well as of the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Unions (CEOSL) had met in the office of the Minister of Labour and had been consulted on the form to be given to the Code of Labour Procedure and on the way in which trade unions are to participate in the running of the Ecuadorian Vocational Training Service (SECAP). These consultations were held in a most friendly atmosphere. Consequently, adds the Government, no trade union leaders in the country had to carry out their activities clandestinely and, on the contrary, they could rely on the assistance of the authorities. It is therefore inconceivable that warrants are outstanding for the arrest of these trade union leaders. Any warrants issued were effective only during the emergency.
.Relations between the Government and workers' organisations, the Government concludes, are at present harmonious, and the principles of freedom of association continue, as in the past, to be observed.
.The Committee has always taken the view that political matters not involving the exercise of freedom of association are outside its competence. In this connection, the Committee refers, in particular, to the Programme of Action adopted by the United Workers' Front, most of which, in the view of the Committee, is either political in character or does not relate to labour matters. The Committee observes that the Programme of Action, inter alia, calls for the installation of a popular and democratic government and for reforms in the fields of defence, economic, social and educational matters, and in administration and public services. As a result of the Government's refusal to meet the demands called for in the said programme, the United Workers' Front organised a -hour national strike.
.In the circumstances, the Committee feels bound to point out that it has always held in the past that the prohibition of strikes by reason of their non-occupational character, or where they have been designed to coerce a government with respect to a political matter or where the strike was directed against a government's policy and was not in furtherance of a trade dispute, does not constitute an infringement of freedom of association.
.With regard to the alleged arrest and imprisonment of more than  trade union leaders on the night of  July , the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw attention to the principle that trade unionists accused of political offences or criminal acts should be speedily brought to trial before an impartial and independent judicial authority and to request the Government to supply information as full and precise as possible concerning the measures which were taken as regards the trade union leaders who are alleged to have been imprisoned.
.With regard to the dissolution of the National Union of Ecuadorian Social Security Workers, the Committee, while it takes account of the circumstances in which this union was dissolved, wishes to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that employers' and workers' organisations should not be subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority, and that such measures, when taken during an emergency situation, should be accompanied by normal judicial safeguards, including the right of appeal to the courts against such dissolution or suspension. The Committee therefore recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to this principle",0,1971,Ecuador
14,".The Committee examined this case previously at its meeting in June , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report which appears in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. The Governing Body approved the Report at its th Session (June ).
.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The case concerns the Constitution, in July , of the United Workers' Front (FUT) which presented an action programme including various demands on the Government, which the latter rejected. The FUT responded to this refusal by organising a -hour nation-wide strike. The Government reacted to this situation by taking a series of steps which included the imprisonment of many of the trade union leaders and the dissolution of the National Union of Ecuadorian Social Security Workers under Executive Decree No.  of  July .
.The Committee considered that most of the items on the FUT action programme did not relate to labour issues. Under these circumstances, it pointed out that it had always taken the view that the prohibition of strikes by reason of their non-occupational character or where they were designed to coerce a government with respect to a political matter, or where the strike was directed against the government's policy and was not in furtherance of a trade dispute, did not constitute an infringement of freedom of association.
.On the subject of the imprisonment of trade union leaders, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to draw attention to the principle that trade unionists accused of political offences or criminal acts should be speedily brought to trial before an impartial and independent judicial authority, and to request the Government to supply information as full and precise as possible concerning the measures which were taken as regards such leaders.
.On the dissolution of the National Union of Ecuadorian Social Security workers, the Committee, while it took account of the circumstances in which this union had been dissolved, emphasised the importance it attached to the principle that employers' and workers' organisations should not be subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority, and that such measures, when taken during an emergency situation, should be accompanied by normal judicial safeguards, including the right of appeal to the courts against such ---------- Now known as the Latin American Central of Workers suspension or dissolution. The Committee, consequently, recommended the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to this principle and to request it to indicate whether the dissolution of the union had been accompanied by any judicial guarantees and whether the union had been reconstituted, or under what conditions it might be reconstituted.
.On  December , the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees sent a communication, with a copy to the Government, on the question of Decree No.  and indicated that since the present Government's accession to power, the National Union of Ecuadorian Social Security Workers had done everything possible to negotiate and have its right to organise restored, but that, so far, guarantees that it could freely exercise that right had not been forthcoming. The Fifth International Trades Congress of Public Employees, held in Moscow in September , passed a resolution on international solidarity, in which it called for the restoration of democratic and trade union rights in Ecuador and the rescinding of Decree No. .
.In a communication dated  May , the Government reported that the union leaders to whom the complaint referred had regained their freedom immediately the political circumstances which had given rise to the measures in question had ceased to prevail. Moreover, the Government was examining requests that it rescind the above-mentioned decree (promulgated by the previous Government) by virtue of which the legal existence of the National Union of Ecuadorian Social Security Workers had been suspended.
.With regard to the allegation concerning the imprisonment of union leaders, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note that they have regained their freedom in the circumstances indicated by the Government, and accordingly to decide that no purpose would be served by continuing its examination of this aspect of the case.
.With regard to the National Union of Ecuadorian Social Security Workers, the Committee regrets that Decree No. , under which the legal personality of this organisation was suspended, remains in force, and recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention once more to the principle referred to in paragraph  above and to request the Government to take all necessary steps to give full effect thereto, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , which Ecuador has ratified.
.The complaint of the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  September  addressed direct to the ILO. This complaint was supported by the World Confederation of Labour in a communication dated  October . The WCL addressed a further complaint dated  October  to the United Nations, which was transmitted to the ILO according to the established procedure. The complaints were communicated to the Government, which sent its observations thereon in three communications dated  November and  December  and  February .
.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  September  the Latin American Federation of Christian Trade Unions (CLASC) states that on  July  the United Workers' Front was formed, being made up of the two main national workers' Confederations, the Ecuadorian Confederation of Christian Workers (CEDOC) and the Confederation of Workers of Ecuador (CTE), plus the following national trade union organisations: the Ecuadorian Confederation of Employees in Semi-State Bodies and Banks (CESBANDOR), the Veterans' Association and the Federation of Workers in the Electrical Industry of Ecuador (FEDELEC).
.This was, state the complainants, the logical outcome of the maturity of the trade union movement, which realises that its strength lies in the unshakable unity of the workers in facing the critical situation resulting from the lack of national development planning, the rise in the cost of living (by more than  per cent), monetary devaluation, and the lack of the most elementary trade union freedoms.
.The complainants add that the United Workers' Front adopted a -point Programme of Action summarising the aspirations of the Ecuadorian workers. Contrary to what the Government had alleged, state the complainants, this programme-of which a copy is supplied by the complainants-was in no way political.
.The United Workers' Front, being faced with the Government's refusal to meet the demands of the workers, declared a -hour national strike, to take place on  and  July . The Government's reaction to this national strike, the complainants allege, was an organised and merciless persecution of the trade union leaders, more than  of whom were imprisoned on the night of  July . According to the complainants, searches were also made of the homes of trade union leaders and of the premises in which the trade union organisations operate.
.On  July, continue the complainants, the President of Ecuador called a press conference at which he stated, inter alia: "" I wish those individuals (trade union leaders) who are the ringleaders behind the disturbances that are disrupting the country every day to know that if the strike continues I shall make them feel the consequences in a way they will regret all their lives. Let them not come to me then for mercy."" Previously, on  July, the President had issued Executive Decree No. -A whereby employers were empowered to dismiss all workers who took part in the national strike. According to the complainants, in Quito alone, the capital of Ecuador, there were  dismissals on  July, while it is estimated that the figure for the whole country exceeded ,.
.The complainants add that on  July the President issued Executive Decree No. , dissolving the National Union of Ecuadorian Social Security Workers, which, under Ministerial Order No. , had enjoyed legal status since  July , and ordered the dismissal of  workers in the said institution for the sole offence of having followed the strike order given by the United Workers' Front.
.The further allegation is made by the complainants that, on  July, by means of an Executive Decree, the Government set up a Control Department (at presidential level) to supervise all broadcasting and television stations, which were ordered to refrain from giving any information connected with the national strike or with the activities of the United Workers' Front. Various broadcasting stations were closed down, including Radio Quito, which has one of the biggest audiences in the country.
.The complainants also alleged that on  July the Government, using the army, put a violent end to the Seventh Latin American Social Security Conference, in which more than  foreign delegates from  countries were taking part. According to the complainants, the only reason given was that in the",-1,1971,Ecuador

.It will be recalled that the Committee had recommended the Governing Body to request the Government (paragraph  (b) of the th Report) to submit its observations on the allegations regarding the arrest, as a result of a general strike, of about one hundred workers and trade union leaders, including: Jaime Parra, a worker at the Boyaca power station; Guillermo Nio, President of the Boyaca Soft Drinks Company Union; Ral Baquero, President of the Paz de Rio Steelworks branch at Samac; Isabel Parada de Guevara, a labour leader; Ral Tapia and Rafael H. Lara, trade union leaders of the cement workers at Boyaca; Victor Acosta, President of UTRAL of Barranquilla; Leopoldo Montes and Benjamin Rizo, union leaders from Barranquilla, "" as well as many other militant trade unionists from Bogot, Bucaramanga and Barrancabermeja, Ccuta, Huila, Girardot, Arbelez and Puerto Tajada "" (paragraph  of the th Report). The Government was also requested to indicate the present situation of the above persons. The Government submitted its further observations on the allegations in a communication dated  August .
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication dated  August , the Government states that those persons who were detained by the authorities during the state of emergency for taking part in illegal demonstrations have now been released, and that all sanctions have now been lifted. It adds that the strike of  March  was illegal and not in conformity with the provisions of the Labour Code. The strike, states the Government, was called without following the procedure established by the Code and was not related to the discussion of any ordinary claim put to the employers, which would have opened the way to lawful strike action. The Government concludes by stating that relations between it and the UTC (Union of Colombian Workers) are excellent at present and that they are collaborating in the solution of labour problems.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statement that the persons who were detained by the authorities during the state of emergency have now been released. The Committee wishes, in this connection, to draw the Government's attention to the principle that measures of preventive detention may involve a serious interference with trade unions which it would seem necessary to justify by the existence of a serious situation or emergency and which would be open to criticism unless accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period. In the present case a state of emergency had been declared and the trade unionists concerned were detained during this period for having participated in strike action which the Government considered to be illegal. No details are supplied by the Government as to what judicial safeguards were available to these persons. In view of the fact, however, that they have been released, the Committee considers that no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of this aspect of the case.
.In all the circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note that the trade unionists, who were stated in the complaint to have been detained, have been released; and(b) for the reasons stated in paragraph  above, to decide that this aspect of the case, and accordingly the case as a whole, do not call for further examination.
.The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) is contained in a communication dated  April  addressed direct to the ILO. This complaint was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a communication dated  May .
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants give the following account of the matter. The leaders of the two large central organisations, the Union of Colombian Workers (UTC) and the Confederation of Colombian Workers (CSTC), having met on  February , decided to organise a twenty-four hour strike throughout the country on  March as a protest against the high cost of living, unemployment and low wages. The strike was also intended to claim from the authorities and the employers an increase in salaries and wages, the freezing of prices for consumer goods and public services, improved social security benefits, the observance of trade union rights and the suppression of compulsory arbitration tribunals.
.According to the WFTU, on  February  the UTC and the CSTC publicly confirmed the nature of the strike in a joint declaration which stated: "" It will be peaceful and will have no other aim than to protest against the anti-labour and anti-trade-union policy and against the present state of affairs in general "".
.The WFTU alleges that, in spite of the peaceful nature of the demand of the movement, the Government declared that the strike was subversive and decreed that all trade union funds should be frozen. At the same time, according to the complainants, making use of the state of emergency proclaimed on  February, the Government began a violent campaign of repression against the workers and trade union leaders who were supporting the strike initiative; thus, throughout the country, hundreds of persons had been arrested before  March.
.The WFTU declares that, in spite of the measures of repression and intimidation, the strike of  March assumed large proportions, and over , workers stopped work on that day "" thus bringing their support to the claims of the National Strike Committee platform "".
.In spite of this, says the WFTU, the Government maintained its repressive measures as well as the measures taken against the trade unions. Ten days after the strike about  workers and trade union leaders were still being detained, including: Jaime Parra, a worker at the Boyac power station; Guillermo Nio, President of the Boyac Soft Drinks Company Union; Ral Baquero, President of the Paz de Rio Steelworks branch at Samac; Isabel Parada de Guevara, a labour leader; Ral Tapia and Rafael H. Lara, trade union leaders of the cement workers at Boyac; Victor Acosta, President of UTRAL of Barranquilla; Leopoldo Montes and Benjamn Rizo, union leaders from Barranquilla, "" as well as many other militant trade unionists from Bogot, Bucaramanga and Barrancabermeja, Cucuta, Huila, Girardot, Arbeldez and Puerto Tajada "".
.The complainants allege that the Government also took other measures against trade union organisations that had supported the strike. The first trade unions against which such measures were taken, the WFTU states, were those from the following firms: La Rosa (Pereira), Cervecerias Aguila, Industrias Simn Hermanos (Barranquilla), Colombiana de Cermica (Cundinamarca) and Industria Licorera de Boyac (Tunja). "" The decree signed by the Minister of Labour, Mr. Jorge Mario Eastman, "" the complainants continue "" suspends for six months the right of the trade unions to be legally recognised thus enabling the employers to dismiss any staff that they wish, including in particular, trade union leaders, after first discussing the matter with the ministry and the labour tribunals in the latter case.
."" Many other trade unions "" according to the WFTU "" are threatened with similar sanctions, particularly the central trade union organisation UTC, which is threatened with the withdrawal of its legal personality. As for the CSTC, the Minister of Labour has discriminated against this organisation by refusing to grant it legal personality even though it has complied with all the conditions required by law "".
.In its observations the Government first points out that only  trade unions out of the , in the country took part in the strike of  March. It also declares that it is because of the state of emergency that decrees were adopted in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code, suspending the legal personality of the trade unions implicated in the strike and freezing their funds.
.Since then, states the Government, recent measures have been taken removing the sanctions which penalise certain trade unions and, it points out, at the present time no trade union is subject to sanctions.
.It would appear from the information supplied by the Government that the trade unions' funds that had been frozen have been released and that the trade unions whose legal personality had been suspended have had this restored.
.With regard to the suspension of legal personality, it appears to the Committee that this had been done by decrees adopted by virtue of the provisions of the Labour Code, which seem to be of a permanent nature and independent of the existence or non-existence of a state of emergency. The Committee wishes to draw attention to the fact that the measures suspending",-1,1971,Colombia

These communications were transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations on  August,  November and  December  and  January .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The various communications from the complainants refer to the fact that Mr. Raimundo Ongaro, a printers' leader and General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of Argentinian Workers (of which the Federation of Printers of Buenos Aires is a member) and substitute member of the ILO Governing Body, was arrested by the police on  May . He was imprisoned by virtue of a Presidential Decree, No. /, which was issued in accordance with the powers conferred upon the President by article  of the Constitution. Although, according to one of the complainants, there is no specific charge against Mr. Ongaro and some government representatives are said to have stated that his imprisonment was due to supposed subversive activities (an accusation refuted by Mr. Ongaro), another of the complaints states that criminal proceedings have been instituted against him before the Federal Court of Resistencia (in the province of Chaco) for offences of incitement to violence and rebellion.
.The complainants also refer to the various trials undergone by Mr. Ongaro in the past, always charged with political offences or with offences related to political matters, in which the judge dismissed the case. Mr. Ongaro's present imprisonment is the second to which he has been subjected, being held at the disposal of the Executive; the first period of imprisonment lasted from  June to  November . According to the complainants, all these facts constitute proof that Mr. Ongaro is the victim of arbitrary persecution designed to induce him to give up his constant activities on behalf of the workers and of the deprived classes of Argentina. This persecution, it is alleged, takes many forms: trials for which, as the judgements subsequently show, there was no legal justification, imprisonments at the disposal of the Executive and abductions by the police.
.In its first communication, dated  August , the Government refers to certain statements made by Mr. Jos Rucci, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina, to the effect that the only leader called Ongaro is a political leader, and, consequently, not a workers' leader. According to the Government, this statement by the highest authority in the trade union sphere shows Mr. Ongaro's lack of representativity and implies that he is not covered by the safeguards enjoyed by genuine trade union leaders.
.Having been requested to send more specific information with regard to the charges against Mr. Ongaro, the reasons for his imprisonment, and his position before the law and in relation to the penal procedure, the Government sent a further communication on  November . In this communication the Government states that, when Mr. Ongaro decided to devote himself to political activities, he voluntarily withdrew from the trade union sphere, in which he holds no post whatsoever in any of the organisations connected with Argentinian trade union affairs. The Government goes on to say that this situation has been confirmed by the leaders of the Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina, who are the sole legal representatives of the Argentinian workers. With regard to the precise information for which it has been asked, the Government states that Mr. Ongaro was arrested for having repeatedly made public statements inciting the people to violence, rebellion and revolution and adds that a further reason for his arrest was the investigation into alleged acts which were calculated to put his words into action. To give a better idea of the situation, the Government encloses photocopies of various newspaper articles which, it states, show that Mr. Ongaro was engaged in activities of a political, rather than of a trade union, nature.
.The Government goes on to say that Mr. Ongaro was imprisoned by virtue of an Executive Decree which was issued in accordance with article  of the Constitution. The terms of this article are as follows: "" In the event of an internal upheaval or attack from outside the country, placing in jeopardy the implementation of this Constitution and the exercise of the authority conferred thereby, a state of emergency shall be declared in the province or territory where the disturbance has broken out, involving the suspension in that province or territory of the guarantees embodied in the Constitution. Throughout the period of suspension, however, the President of the Republic may not pronounce judgement or sentence on his own account. His power in such cases shall be limited, in the case of individuals, to ordering their arrest or transfer from one place within the country to another, unless they prefer to leave Argentinian territory.""
.The Government concludes by stating that the State Prosecutor has arranged for the case to be brought before the judicial authorities of the province of Chaco, which have requested the Executive to have Mr. Ongaro transferred into their jurisdiction for his trial in accordance with the relevant judicial procedure. Consequently, the Government adds, it is obvious that the competent Argentinian authorities have acted in accordance with the procedural and statutory provisions in force, which are designed to ensure the maintenance of law and order in the country, which might be seriously undermined by such openly subversive attitudes as those advocated by Mr. Ongaro.
.In a subsequent communication, dated  December , the Government provides further information, according to which Mr. Ongaro was remanded in custody by the judicial authorities, charged with incitement to rebellion, an offence punishable under article  of the Penal Code. The charges are based on statements made by Mr. Ongaro in the town of Resistencia (in the province of Chaco) on  May , in the presence of journalists.
.Lastly, in its communication dated  January , the Government states that the President of the nation, in response to a request made by the General Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina, has ordered Mr. Ongaro's release.
.The Committee observes, as regards the functions of Mr. Ongaro, that although the Government maintains that he withdrew voluntarily from the trade union sphere, occupying no post whatsoever in the organisations connected with "" Argentinian trade union affairs "" (in support of which the Government quotes certain statements made by the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of the Republic of Argentina), on the other hand the complainants (and available information derived from the press) refer to Mr. Ongaro as a printers' leader and General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour of Argentinian Workers, a different organisation from that just mentioned.
.As regards Mr. Ongaro's position from the legal point of view, the Committee notes from the information supplied that he was arrested by order of the Executive and held at the disposal of the latter by virtue of the powers conferred on it by the Constitution in the event of a state of emergency and that, at the same time, the judicial authorities had remanded him in custody on charges under the Penal Code.
.With regard to measures of detention during a state of emergency, the Committee wishes to recall that although it has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency, it has emphasised that such measures should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period and that a person under arrest should be afforded the guarantee of regular judicial proceedings with the least possible delay.
.The Committee has examined the press reports furnished by the Government and containing the statements made by Mr. Ongaro on  May . Most of these refer to matters of a political nature.
.In any event, and in view of the fact that Mr. Ongaro has regained his freedom, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, subject to what is stated in paragraph  above regarding the safeguards of regular judicial proceedings, that this case calls for no further examination.",0,1971,Argentina

.The complainants state in their communication that they wish to draw attention to the serious violations of trade union rights and freedom by the National Guard and the Ministries of Labour and Education affecting the Federacin Sindical de Maestros de Nicaragua (Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation), which was founded on  March  and registered with the Ministry of Labour. The FSMN, state the complainants, was constituted in accordance with the Labour Code in force at that time, which laid down that "" Five trade unions may form themselves into a federation "" (section ). Accordingly, the teachers' unions of Boaco, Chinandega, Jinotaga, Matagalpa and Managua formed the FSMN, which was duly registered.
.On  August , the complainants continue, during a strike of the teaching body, groups of workers were sent under pressure by the National Guard to the "" Teachers' House "" to evict the teachers but they were quickly driven away by the students and other people who had come to defend the teachers.
.In October , the complainants add, the authorities froze the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua (, crdobas) and puppet unions were set up by the Ministries of Labour and Education. There was also direct intervention by these Ministries in the election of the leaders of the teachers' unions and meetings were attended by inspectors of public education, mayors, political leaders and police chiefs.
.The complainants further state that in December  the Government organised personal visits to all the teachers in order to oblige them to support the Government and td join the puppet unions. Refusal to do so, add the complainants, was likely to entail transfer or dismissal. Previously, on  October , the Government, faced with a general stoppage of work by the teaching body at all levels (primary, secondary and university-the latter for  hours as a token of solidarity), as well as by the teachers of Catholic schools, had ended the school year six weeks in advance.
.The complainants state that before the teachers' strike in support of their claims, three members of the executive of the FSMN, namely Mr. Leopoldo Montenegro Lara, Chairman of the union of teachers of Managua, Mr. Juan Alberto Henrique Oporta, press and information secretary of the executive committee of the FSMN, and Mrs. Silvia Villagrasa Gutirrez, record secretary of the same committee, were imprisoned. These persons were charged with being members of the FSLN (a clandestine organisation opposing the Government by military means). The Security Bureau, after torturing them and eliciting false statements from them, brought them before a judge who, being unable to find any valid charge, acquitted them unconditionally.
.On  November  the Ministry of Education began to dismiss teachers who had taken part in the strike. So far, say the complainants, there have been  dismissals, and it is feared that this figure may reach .
.In its reply the Government states that official policy has always been designed to ensure the existence and gradual improvement of the trade union movement and that every facility had been provided for the free exercise of their activities. Certain national trade unions, however, had pursued activities in fields forbidden by law and it was only natural, states the Government, that the State should intervene.
.The Government continues that the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation has itself admitted that on  August  the teaching body was on strike. This, states the Government, implied a flagrant breach of the national legislation and a complete lack of respect for the Basic Charter of Nicaragua and for the criminal laws. The same Federation has been guilty of repeated breaches of the law and of political activities. For example, it has ignored the provisions of section  of the Constitution, which provides for the dismissal of persons engaged in a concerted stoppage of work in public services or in services of vital importance to society. The Government adds that this Federation has also been guilty of a breach of section  (c) of Decree No.  of  November , which prohibits the incitement, in any form, of illegal strikes. It has also refused deliberately to conform to the rules governing the announcement of the intention to strike, when a strike is permitted by law, as laid down in section  et seq. of the Labour Code. The Government points out that, in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, strikes in the public services are forbidden and any disputes between employers and workers must be submitted to the labour courts for a ruling.
.The Federation, continues the Government, has also been guilty of breaches of the Trade Union Regulations, which require every trade union to supply the labour authorities with information concerning changes in the composition of the executive, membership, etc., of the union and lay down certain regulations regarding federations of unions. In this connection, the Government claims that the Teachers' Trade Union Federation was composed of unions from different departments, thus contravening the provisions of section  of the above Regulations, which provides that trade unions from different departments may not form a federation.
.With regard to the stoppage of work by the teachers, the Government states that the complainant's allegation in this connection is an open confession of a breach of the law. The matter has been submitted to the Supreme Court of Justice, whose verdict is awaited.
.The Government denies that the funds of the Teachers' Union of Managua were either frozen or seized. The Ministry, adds the Government, supervised the use of the funds in question to ensure against their misuse. This it did in response to a plea from the members of the Teachers' Union. The Union, states the Government, has at all times been free to use these funds and, in any event, it is not true that the funds amounted to , crdobas as stated by the complainants. In this connection the Government supplies, inter alia, copies of a certificate by the Director of Associations reporting the receipt of a plea from members of the Teachers' Union asking for the funds of the Union to be audited and the decision taken by the Director to this effect, copies of letters sent by the Bank of America to the Director of Associations reporting on the balance of the Union's accounts, and an audit certificate from the auditors of the Ministry of Labour. From the documents it also appears that the Union is not allowed to withdraw any sums from its bank accounts without the authorisation of the Director of Associations.
.The Committee notes that the complaint essentially concerns the action taken by the Government before, during and following a stoppage of work by the teaching body. The main allegations contained in the complaint relate to the imprisonment of certain trade union leaders, the right of the teaching body to proclaim a strike, the status of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, the seizure of certain trade union funds by the authorities and acts of interference by the Government in the establishment of new trade unions.
.The Committee notes that the Government's reply contains no reference to the allegation that three executive members of the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation were imprisoned. The Committee observes, however, that the complainants state that these persons were charged with being members of a clandestine organisation, and no information has been submitted to the Committee to indicate that the charges were in any way related to the trade union activities of these persons. In any event, the Committee notes that, according to the complainants, these persons have been released after having been brought to trial and in these circumstances it considers that this aspect of the complaint does not call for further examination.
.With regard to the strike action taken by the Nicaraguan Teachers' Trade Union Federation, the Committee notes that the Government takes the view that such a stoppage of work was in breach of the law since it involved a strike in the public services (teachers in government schools). The Committee assumes that the Government's reference to the teachers' non-observance of the normal procedure for initiating strikes can be taken to apply to teachers in Catholic schools.
.The Committee has taken the view that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they concern the exercise of trade union rights. In the case of public servants, the Committee has taken the view that recognition of the principle of freedom of association does not necessarily imply the right to strike. However, the Committee, in considering a number of cases of national legislation that denies the right to strike to public servants, has stressed the importance that it attaches, when strikes are prohibited or are subject to restrictions in essential services or in the civil service, to the establishment of adequate safeguards to protect the interests of the workers who are thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, and it has pointed out that such restrictions should",0,1971,Nicaragua
18,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1971,Dominican Republic
19,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1971,Dominican Republic
20,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  September  addressed direct to the ILO by the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation.
.The complaint was duly transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations thereon in a communication dated  January  addressed direct to the Director-General.
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  September  the complainants state that in accordance with Act No.  of  July , which set up the Popular and Community Development Bank of Costa Rica, their Confederation (viz. the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation) was entitled to have two representatives on the Executive Board of the said Bank. The complainants add that, in spite of the fact that the Minister of Labour had promised to support their nominations, the Council of the Government, under pressure from the Inter-American Regional Organisation of Workers (GRIT) and the American Institute for the Development of Free Trade Unionism (IADSL) and after an investigation into the private lives of the proposed candidates, decided to appoint only one representative.
.In its communication dated  January  the Government points out that Act No.  of  July  (published in the official gazette "" La Gaceta "", No.  of  July ) provides in its interim provision IX that within  days of the coming into force of the Act a provisional national Board of Directors shall be appointed and, inter alia, that the duly registered democratic workers' Confederations shall each appoint two representatives. In accordance with this provision, two members of the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation and two members of the Costa Rican Democratic Workers' Confederation were appointed to the provisional Board of Directors of the Bank.
.Subsequently, the Government adds, the provisional Board of Directors submitted a draft bill to the Legislative Assembly with a view to extending to four years the original two-year term of office of the provisional board. The Legislative Assembly, however, did not agree to this proposal and instead promulgated Act No.  of  August  (published in the official gazette "" La Gaceta "" on  August ), which modified the provisions of Act No.  of  July .
.The Government explains that the new Act No.  provides that the Council of the Government shall appoint four representatives of the duly registered workers' Confederations from lists of three names which each Confederation shall submit within not more than five days of the date of entry into force of the Act and that these appointments shall be made not more than ten days from the date of entry into force of the Act. The Act further provides that the provisional national Board of Directors shall cease to function two years and six months from the date of its appointment with the exception of those members appointed in accordance with the new Act.
.The Government states that the Council of the Government (i.e. the President and the Government Ministers) were empowered to appoint members from the workers' con federations but that the Act did not indicate the number of representatives which must be appointed from each of the Confederations. The Council made its selection of representatives from the lists of three names submitted to it. The purpose of the law is that the appointments should be made on the basis of the degree of representativity of the Confederations concerned. The Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation, states the Government, was not the organisation which had the greatest number of members. The Government, accordingly, rejects any allegation that it committed any infringement of trade union rights.
.In some previous cases, the Committee has taken the view that it was not called upon to express an opinion as to the right of a particular organisation to be invited to take part in certain bodies unless its exclusion constituted a clear case of discrimination affecting the principle of freedom of association, and that this was a matter to be determined by the Committee in the light of the facts in each given case.
.Moreover, the Committee has previously observed z that on several occasions, and especially when the draft text of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention was being discussed, the International Labour Conference has referred to the question of the representative character of workers' and employers' organisations and has admitted to some extent the distinction sometimes made between various organisations according to the extent to which they are representative.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that provision of Act No.  of  July  whereby the complainant organisation was entitled to have two representatives on the provisional executive board of the Popular and Community Development Bank of Costa Rica has been amended by Act No.  of  August  to the effect that the Council of the Government shall nominate four representatives from the registered workers' Confederations out of a list of three names submitted by each of these organisations. By such a procedure it would appear that the Council is under no obligation to nominate an equal number of members from each of the Confederations, and, according to the complainants, only one member proposed by them was nominated by the Council. The Committee further notes the Government's explanation that the purpose of the Act is that the members of the executive body of the Bank should be selected by the Council on the basis of the degree of representativity of each of the Confederations concerned, and that the complainant organisation was not the one having the largest membership.
.In the circumstances, the Committee considers that the complainants have failed to furnish proof of any discrimination affecting the principle of freedom of association in the present instance and, accordingly, recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",1,1971,Costa Rica
21,".The Committee has already examined allegations relating to the years immediately following the change of regime on  August  (closing down of the COB, the La Paz Departmental Central of Workers and the FSTMB; takeover of the National Urban Schoolteachers' Federation; arrest and banishment of trade unionists). It has also examined more recent complaints concerning events occurring from November  onwards. These latter allegations related mainly to the legislation on trade unions adopted at that time and to the trade union situation in the mining industry. At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the measures which it was urgent to take concerning the mineworkers still under arrest or in exile, the adoption and the application of new trade union legislation, and the miners' radio stations. The Governing Body also decided, pending receipt of this information, and taking into account the fact that two missions of direct contacts had already been carried out in Bolivia, to suspend its decision on the desirability of setting up a commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint submitted under article  of the ILO Constitution.
.More specifically, the allegations relating to the legislation adopted in  were concerned mainly with Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the Basic Statutes of Government), Presidential Decree No.  (concerning labour co-ordinators and the freezing of trade union funds), and Legislative Decree No.  (establishing the compulsory civil service), promulgated in November . Legislative Decree No.  provided, inter alia, that ""pending the reorganisation of the executive Committees of employers' associations, trade unions, professional associations, craft unions, students' unions and university staff unions, in accordance with rules to be laid down in due course by the National Government, it is hereby ordered that the term of office of the officials of the aforementioned organisations and their respective federations and Confederations shall be at an end, and that strikes, stoppages, lockouts and all other forms of suspension and paralysis of work and production shall be prohibited"". The Government had replaced the trade union executives by labour co-ordinators which it appointed itself (pending the enactment of a labour code) in each centre of production and in each occupational sector. The main function of the labour co-ordinators was to represent the workers in submitting individual and collective claims. Acceptance of this office was compulsory, any person refusing to accept being liable to sanctions under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , establishing the compulsory civil service. Wages were frozen in January , but in practice the Government tolerated collective bargaining on wages, provided that it took place without publicity. In addition, trade union meetings and finances were subjected to various restrictions.
.The complaint filed under article  of the ILO Constitution referred to observations made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the application of Convention No. . Mention was made in particular of the comments of  concerning the provisions in the General Labour Act dealing with trade unions.
.A special national Committee drafted a new labour code and rules of procedure, designed to replace in particular the General Labour Act. At the request of the Government, the Office sent its comments on this text, especially the provisions dealing with trade union rights. In April , the Government stated that the National Drafting Committee had endeavoured to bring the guiding principles of its draft into line with the ILO's opinion in order to make the two documents concord as closely as possible. The Government had also sought the views of certain employers' and workers' representatives, but considered that a more thorough analysis would need to be made by all the employers' and workers' sectors involved. It therefore had plans for consultations to take place before the new legislation was adopted. Nevertheless, not wishing to create a vacuum during this interim period, the Government had taken a series of measures. In particular, it cited the measures taken to facilitate the election of workers' local Committees and the holding of national assemblies in the various sectors of activity to enable them to analyse their specific problems and appoint co-ordinators. This had been done mainly in the following sectors: mines, railways, telecommunications, electric light and power, telephones and airports. In addition, continued the Government, the new Act respecting labour procedure should enable the recognition of workers' rights to be speeded up and facilitate their action before labour jurisdictions.
.In May  the Committee noted in particular that the Labour Code, and especially its provisions as regards trade unions, had still not been adopted. In consequence the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, urged the Government to do everything possible to expedite the adoption and application of the new trade union legislation.
.As concerns the trade union situation in the mining industry, the Committee has examined in particular allegations concerning events which took place throughout this industry in June and July . According to the complainants, wage claims presented again following the XVIth National Mineworkers' Congress (May ), and a strike that was planned if these demands were not satisfied, had provided the Government with an opportunity to represent the action not as an economic claim by the workers, but as a political manoeuvre. Consequently, before the strike had been declared in support of the workers' demands, the armed forces had occupied most of the mining sectors and a series of repressive measures - including the closing down of the FSTMB and of local trade unions in mining areas, the occupation of the miners' radio stations and the arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade union officials and workers - had been taken against the workers and their leaders. The Government argued that it was really a question of political and even subversive activities by leaders in the mines and other sectors, which had been made to look like action in support of economic claims. The wage demands - which, as was known by the miners' leaders, were totally unacceptable to the Government - had to be met within a fixed period, according to a decision taken at the Congress in question. The Congress had also adopted resolutions and declarations of a political character in which the Government had been strongly attacked. According to the Government, all these facts, together with others, were proof of the existence of a plan whose ultimate aim was to bring about its overthrow.
.In November  the Committee felt that it did not possess sufficient information to take a decision on the basic questions involved in full knowledge of the facts, but nevertheless noted the exceptional circumstances of a political nature which had arisen in Bolivia and which had accompanied demands for wage increases which were long overdue. The Committee reached various conclusions and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body urged the Government, inter alia, to re-establish normal trade union conditions in the mining sector as soon as possible, to re-examine the question of closing of the miners' broadcasting stations, and to reconsider, in particular, the situation of the workers and leaders in this sector who were still imprisoned or exiled.
.In February  the Government stated that pending the adoption of the new labour legislation, the miners had democratically elected genuinely representative bodies which, under the name of local Committees, performed all trade union functions and had deserved full recognition by the Government. The Comibol mining enterprise had already implemented one-third of the obligations undertaken in the collective agreement negotiated with the local Committees, and it was hoped that the agreement could be fully implemented within the agreed time limit. The Government mentioned that it had adopted a Presidential Decree, No.  of  December , whereby a high-level mining advisory council was set up to prepare and co-ordinate labour and social policy on behalf of the miners.
.The case of the mine radio transmitters, added the Government, had been brought before the competent judicial authorities, who were to take the final decision as to whether or not mines might retain their broadcasting licences in the light of their abuses of freedom of expression and other offences under the General Telecommunications and Broadcasting Act. Nevertheless, stated the Government, in order to create a favourable climate, it had returned the radio transmitters to the administrative Committees formed by the local Committees and works delegates after replacing the parts which had been carried off by the trade union leaders who had fled, and all these transmitters were operating. Radio Llallagua, which according to the Government was a special case, had been returned to the municipality, its rightful owner. In April , the Government added that the intervention of the authorities was due to the fact that these radio stations did not have the necessary authorisation to operate under the general regulations governing radio-electrical services, but that the stations in question were now fulfilling all the necessary requirements for the purpose of legalising their situation, which would enable them to resume normal operations. At its May-June  session,",0,1971,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
22,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",-1,1971,Dominican Republic
23,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1971,Dominican Republic
24,".This case was dealt with by the Committee at its Session of November  when it presented a report which appears in paragraphs - of its th Report, which was submitted to the Governing Body for examination at its th Session (February-March ). Since new information was received from the Government the Governing Body decided at that meeting to postpone examination of the case.
.Chile has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint is contained in a communication dated  November . In another communication of  January  the complainants submitted additional information. The communications were sent to the Government, which submitted its observations on them on  May and  December  and on  February .
.In a letter dated  November  the complainants alleged that the Government had violated the principles of freedom of association in Manufacturas Sumar, which had been taken over and placed under the control of an administrator appointed by the Ministry of Economy and Commerce.
.The complainants ""in their capacity as managers"" of the above-mentioned trade union stated that they had been dismissed from the company on  August  in spite of the protection afforded by labour law to trade union leaders and that thirty-five other workers had also been dismissed from the company on the same date. According to the complainants their dismissal as trade union leaders is contrary to section  of the Labour Code and section  of Act No. . The complainants also alleged that they were dismissed by reason of their trade union activity in the defence of their companions at work who had been unjustly persecuted because of their political opinions. The complainants added that they had instituted court proceedings to secure the reinstatement of the persons concerned on  September . The complaint provided no further information about the other thirty-five workers.
.According to section  of the Labour Code the members of the executive Committee of the trade union may not be dismissed from an undertaking without the consent of a labour judge whose consent shall be granted only in certain clearly specified cases. Section  of Act No. , which lays down rules for the termination of contracts of employment, provides that trade union leaders may not be dismissed by their employers without authorisation from a judge, that such authorisation may be granted only in certain clearly specified cases (assault, insulting language or highly immoral conduct, intentional damage to plant, etc.). It was stated that this prior authorisation had never been given by a judge.
.In its reply dated  May  the Government does not question the status of Messrs. Toro Trujillo and Jara Viveros as trade union leaders or the protection against dismissal which the provisions mentioned guarantee. However, the Government affirms that the persons concerned were covered by one of the specific cases permitting dismissal, since they had organised a stoppage of work on  August  in order to prevent the administrator appointed by the Government from carrying out his duties. This stoppage, according to the Government, was manifestly unlawful because it not only failed to comply with the requirements laid down by Chilean law for stoppages to be considered lawful, but also because it was motivated by non-occupational considerations"". The Government stated, however, that owing to an erroneous interpretation of the law the administrator of the company did not apply for authorisation from the labour judge for dismissing the trade union leaders concerned. The Government added that in the case mentioned by the complainants the administrative authorities could not be held responsible for this error of interpretation since responsibility lay with the administrator, who, in spite of his status as a civil servant, was independent of the administrative authorities in so far as he represented the undertaking. The Government states that if a request for authorisation to dismiss the officials had been made, it would have been granted by the judge.
.It appears from the Government's communication, which provides information on the progress made in the judicial proceedings instituted by the persons concerned after their dismissal, that the matter is still under consideration. The Government states, however, that apart from the court proceedings, negotiations have been held with the persons concerned in an effort to meet agreement. The proceedings instituted by the other workers dismissed in connection with the same events are now closed; some of the persons concerned had withdrawn their appeals and the others had been compensated. The President of the Republic had personally intervened with a view to an amicable settlement being reached.
.In the light of this information the Committee presented certain interim conclusions in its th Report. The Government in its communication of  December  pointed out that the complaint had not been submitted by the Non-manual Workers' Union of Manufacturas Sumar but by two ex-leaders of that union, that it did not appear to have been signed either by either the President or the Secretary of the trade union, and that it did not bear the address or seal of the organisation. Consequently the Government requested that the report of the Committee should be modified accordingly. Subsequently in its communication of  February  the Government presented additional information concerning the substance of the question.
.In this communication the Government repeats certain statements which appeared in its reply of  May , concerning the lawfulness of the stoppages in which the complainants and other workers took part. The Government adds that Act No.  of  provides that one of the grounds on which an employment contract may be terminated is refusal without justification to perform the tasks agreed in the contract and maintains that a stoppage constitutes such a cause, as Chilean tribunals have considered according to the jurisprudence of the country. Thus in accordance with labour legislation the social and economic claims of workers may be expressed only through the procedure laid down in the Labour Code and in Regulation  concerning collective disputes. The process of conciliation provided in legislation may be followed by a strike if there is no agreement between the parties, but an unwarranted interruption of work, or a stoppage, is punishable by the termination of the contract of employment.
.In various previous cases', the Committee has considered that the fact of requiring certain conditions to be filled before a strike is considered legal, provided always that such conditions are reasonable, does not constitute a violation of trade union freedom. The new information supplied by the Government shows that the complainants and other workers declared a strike in an unwarranted manner and without having complied with the requirement of prior conciliation as provided by law. The Committee has also considered that the principle according to which a worker or trade union leader must not suffer prejudice on account of his trade union activities does not necessarily imply that the fact of holding trade union office confers upon the holder an immunity against possible dismissal whatever its causes.
.In these circumstances the Committee considers that the dismissal of the complainants did not take place in circumstances such as to allow an allegation of violation of the principles concerning protection of the right of association and consequently recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not require further examination.",0,1971,Chile
25,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",-1,1971,Dominican Republic
26,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.
.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May ",-1,1971,Dominican Republic
27,"it again made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information.
.Regarding Cases Nos. , ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: three communications, of  October ,  September  and  June , from the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), a communication of  November , from the National Federation of Dockworkers, two communications, of  May  and  November , from the Stevedores' Union (POASI), a communication of  August , from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), two communications, of  September  and  July , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), three communications, of  November ,  July and  October , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).
.These complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, with requests for observations. Apart from some very general replies sent by communications of  January and  July , and despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the first complaints (Case No. ), the Committee received no information from the Government on the various allegations. In November  and May , the Committee sent urgent requests to the Government to submit the information requested (Case No. ).
.As the information requested on all these cases was not received, the Committee asked the Director-General in November  to communicate with the highest level of the Government, on behalf of the Committee, expressing the Committee's concern and urgently requesting the Government to provide the observations requested from it (Cases Nos. , ,  and ). The Government finally submitted information by communications of ,  and  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.This case has already been the subject of a report by the Committee, contained in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. In this report the Committee, and subsequently the Governing Body, noted that despite repeated requests, the Government had still not furnished its observations on the allegations made.
.Immediately after the Committee's session, held on  May , the Director-General received the Government's observations, which are contained in a communication dated  May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that according to information provided by their member organisation in the Dominican Republic-the National Union of Heavy-Machinery Operators-the headquarters of the UNACHOSIN and POASI unions were broken into and ransacked and that Mr. Albuquerque, General Secretary of the UNACHOSIN union, and  other workers, members of this organisation, were arrested. The complainants maintain that these acts were carried out by members of the national police force in collaboration with a private organisation connected with the Government and called the "" Juventud Democrtica Reformista Anticomunista "".
.In its observations, the Government states that "" the furniture and premises belonging to the POASI and UNACHOSIN unions are private union property and, if they have been destroyed, the unions can apply to the courts for any damages sustained since the registration of a union, by conferring legal personality upon it, gives it power to institute court proceedings "".
.The Government adds that the premises of the UNACHOSIN union were handed back to the union's officers a few days after the incident and that "" trade union activities in both the POASI and the UNACHOSIN are proceeding normally "".
.While it notes that, according to the information related in the preceding paragraph, the situation in the POASI and UNACHOSIN unions appears to have returned to normal, the Committee also notes, from what is stated in paragraphs  and , that the Government does not deny that there had been such intervention.
.In these circumstances, the Committee finds itself obliged to recommend the Governing Body, as it did when it last examined the case:(a) while it recognises that trade unions, like other associations or individuals, cannot claim immunity against a search of their premises, to emphasise the importance that should be attached to the principle that such a search should be made only following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority, after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that such a search will provide the evidence required to prosecute for an offence under ordinary law, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the International Labour Conference, at its th Session (Geneva, ), in its resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, considered that the right to protection of trade union property was one of those civil liberties which are essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Albuquerque, General Secretary of the UNACHOSIN union, and of  other workers, members of this organisation, the Committee notes that the Government has made no reference to this matter in its observations.
.The Committee recalls that, in all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of trade union leaders, the Committee itself and the Governing Body, taking the view that individuals should be presumed innocent until found guilty, have considered that it was for the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.The Committee further recalls that in cases of this kind, when the Committee itself and the Governing Body reached the conclusion that allegations concerning the arrest, detention or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further examination, this was only after observations had been received from the Government showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures were in no way occasioned by trade union activities, but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to submit its observations on the complainants' allegations concerning arrests, specifying the present situation of Mr. Albuquerque and of the  workers said to have been arrested with him.
.As regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the ransacking of the POASI and UNACHOSIN unions:(i) while it recognises that trade unions, like other associations or individuals, cannot claim immunity against a search of their premises, to emphasise the importance that should be attached to the principle that such a search should be made only following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority, after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that such a search will provide the evidence required to prosecute for an offence under ordinary law, and provided that the search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued;(ii) to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the International Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ), in its resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, considered that the right to protection of trade union property was one of those civil liberties which are essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the arrest of Mr. Albuquerque and  other workers, for the reasons stated in paragraphs  and  above, to request the Government to furnish its observations thereon, specifying the present situation of the persons concerned;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the additional information referred to in the preceding subparagraph.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint made by the International Metalworkers' Federation is contained in a communication dated  June  addressed direct to the ILO.
.The complainants allege that, according to information provided by their affiliated organisation in the Dominican Republic, the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators, the headquarters of the UNACHOSIN and POASI unions have been broken into and ransacked, and that Fliz Albuquerque, General Secretary of UNACHOSIN, and  other workers belonging to this union have been arrested. This action, the complainants state, has been taken by members of the national police force together with a private organisation linked to the Government and called the "" Juventud Democrtica Reformista Anticomunista "".
.On  June , this complaint was forwarded to the Government, which has made no comments on it. Accordingly, at its session in November , the Committee urged the Government to supply the information requested (th Report, paragraph ). This",-1,1971,Dominican Republic
28,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",-1,1971,Dominican Republic
29,"appeal having proved fruitless, the Committee, at its session in February , and by virtue of the procedure set forth in paragraph  of its th Report, informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the matter at the Committee's present session, even if the information requested from the Government had still not been received. This information has not yet been received.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observation made by the Committee as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(b) to note that the allegations made involve a number of principles relating to the free exercise of trade union rights;(c) recognising that trade unions, like other associations or persons, cannot claim immunity from search for their premises, to emphasise the importance which the Committee attaches to the principle that such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority, after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law, and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued;(d) to draw attention to the fact that the international Labour Conference at its th Session (Geneva, ) in its resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, expressed the view that the right to protection of trade union property was one of those civil liberties which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights;(e) to recall that in all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official, the Committee and the Governing Body, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, have considered that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned;(f) to recall that in cases of this kind, while the Committee and the Governing Body have reached the conclusion that allegations relating to the arrest, detention or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further consideration this was only after considering observations from the governments concerned indicating the specific measures taken against such persons and showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures were in no way occasioned by the exercise of trade union freedoms but by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature;(g) to note that in this particular case the Government has failed to supply information showing that the allegations made by the complainants are unfounded;(h) to draw attention to the principle that it should be the policy of every government to ensure observance of the rights of man and, especially, of the right of all detained or accused persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment; and(i) to request the Director-General to maintain all appropriate forms of contact with the Government in order to obtain information concerning the situation of the trade unionists, mentioned in paragraph  above, who were arrested.",0,1971,Dominican Republic
30,"days, during which her house was watched by the police.
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that following the coup d'tat of October , the Government of Torres Gonzlez, which lacked popular support, was forced by extreme left-wing parties to follow a policy which bred fear and insecurity in all sectors of the country. A number of extremist agitators made their way into the Bolivian workers' movement, which had achieved much in the past.
.The Government claims that all workers' organisations enjoy every guarantee towards their development but that some leaders had compromised themselves politically with the Government which was deposed in August , by substituting political activities for trade union activities. These few trade union leaders, on  August in Santa Cruz, and on  August in La Paz, distributed arms to workers and students whom they had incited against their own brothers.
.The Government states that the free functioning of the following organisations is proof that freedom of association is observed: the Confederation of Manufacturing Workers of Bolivia, with  member unions; the Trade Union Federation of Railway Workers, with  member unions; the Confederation of Bank Employees and Allied Workers, with  member unions; the Trade Union Confederation of Drivers of Bolivia, with  member unions; the Trade Union Confederation of Building Workers, with  member unions; the Confederation of Municipal Workers, with  member unions; and the National Federation of Mine Workers, with  member unions. Altogether, states the Government,  Confederations,  federations,  trade unions and other organisations are functioning normally.
.The Government adds that the small number of former trade union leaders who were arrested when it was proved that they had been involved in activities against the security of the State have been released, and that others will be tried before the ordinary courts.
.The aim of the labour policy of the Government is the independence of the Bolivian workers' movement. There is no justification, states the Government, for any state intervention in the internal affairs of trade unions, provided they are not misled by anarchists.
.The Committee notes that the complaint concerns mainly the arrest at La Paz airport of three representatives of the Confederation of Manufacturing Workers of Bolivia in October , and the detention of a number of trade union leaders, whose names are supplied by the complainants. The Government, in reply to the complaint, makes no reference to the specific allegations made in this respect by the complainants, but confines itself to stating that a number of trade union leaders had compromised themselves with the previous Government, that a small number of leaders who were arrested have been released and that others will be tried by the ordinary courts.
.The Committee has often emphasised that, when detailed factual charges are put forward, governments should formulate detailed factual replies for objective examination by the Committee. In the present case, while the Committee has noted the information supplied by the Government concerning the number of trade union organisations which appear to be functioning normally in Bolivia, the Committee considers that it is unable to express a considered view to the Governing Body with regard to the complaint since the Government has supplied no specific information in reply to the allegations concerning the arrest and detention of the persons referred to or named in paragraphs  and  above. In a number of cases where there were allegations that trade union leaders or workers had been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amounted to general denials of the allegations or were simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security, or for common law crimes, the Committee followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings, in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the information supplied by the Government with regard to the trade union situation in Bolivia;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle expressed in paragraph  above and to request the Government to supply detailed information concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against the trade union leaders referred to in paragraphs  and  above, as well as the text of the sentences and the grounds adduced therefor; and(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will present a further report when it has received the information requested in subparagraph (b) of this paragraph.Geneva,  February .

In addition, the complainants supplied a list of women whom they alleged to have been imprisoned. This list included the names of Edmy Alvarez Daza, a leader of the Bolivian Workers' Confederation, and Enma de Bacarreza, leader of the La Paz Teachers' Union. The complainants stated that the house of the latter had been searched and that she had been taken to the Ministry of the Interior to make statements. This, continued the complainants, had lasted several days, during which her house was watched by the police.
.In this connection, since no specific replies to these allegations had been supplied by the Government, a fact that prevented the Committee from expressing a considered view to the Governing Body with regard to the complaint, the Committee emphasised, as it has often done in the past in similar cases, that when detailed factual charges are put forward governments should formulate detailed factual replies for objective examination by the Committee. The Committee, at the same time, drew the attention of the Government to the rule which it has followed in a number of cases, namely that, where allegations are made that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested for trade union activities, and the governments' replies amount to general denials of the allegations or are simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security, or for crimes under ordinary law, the governments concerned should be requested to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings, in order to enable the Committee to make a proper examination of the allegations.
.Accordingly, the Committee requested the Government to supply detailed information concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against the trade union leaders in question, as well as the text of the sentences and the grounds adduced therefor.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that it respects and guarantees the independence of workers' organisations and the free exercise of trade union rights. The Government adds that seven Confederations and forty federations are operating normally and that no strikes have taken place for seven months. The Government supplies a list of organisations which have re-elected their officers since  August .
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government. It regrets, however, that despite the urgent nature of the matters involved, the Government has again failed to communicate any information concerning the specific allegations formulated by the complainants. In this connection the Committee would draw the attention of the Government to the observation which it made as early as its First Report, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part should recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.The Committee would recall that in all cases involving the arrest, detention or sentencing of a trade union official, the Committee and the Governing Body, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, have considered that it was incumbent upon the government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned. The Committee would also recall that in cases of this kind, when the Committee and the Governing Body have reached the conclusion that allegations relating to the arrest, detention or sentencing of trade unionists did not call for further consideration, this was only after considering observations from the governments concerned indicating the specific measures taken against such persons and showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures were in no way occasioned by the exercise of trade union freedoms but by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with regret that, in spite of the urgent nature of the matter, the Government has supplied no specific observations on the allegations made by the complainants, with the result that the Committee is unable to reach its conclusions on the case;(b) to recall that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part should recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations and principles set out in paragraphs  and  above;(d) to request the Government once again to supply detailed information concerning the judicial proceedings instituted against the trade union leaders mentioned in paragraph  above, as well as the texts of the sentences and the grounds adduced therefor; and(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested in accordance with subparagraph (d) of this paragraph.Geneva,  November .

He had been sentenced to one year's imprisonment by virtue of legislation outlawing the Communist Party and making those who carry on propaganda in favour of banned associations liable to imprisonment. He had subsequently been set free. There was nothing in the verdicts rendered to indicate the specific facts of which this person had been accused. In its st Report, the Committee had found this the more regrettable in that the Government had not provided the precise information asked for about the actual circumstances which led to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa's conviction.
.The Committee had taken the view that it was not competent to consider purely political allegations, but that it could and should consider action of a political nature taken by governments in so far as such action might affect the exercise of trade union rights. It had recalled that the aim of its procedure is to ensure respect for freedom of association in law as well as in fact and that it is convinced that just as this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.In these circumstances, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above, and to deplore the fact that neither the Government's comments nor the verdicts rendered contained any specific information about the actual circumstances which led to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa's conviction, as a result of which the Committee was unable to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.In its latest communication, the Government states that the person concerned did not lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court against the decision of the competent court of appeal, and that this decision has therefore become binding and may no longer be changed. The National Constitution, the Government adds, establishes the separation of the legislative, executive and judicial powers and the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by law. The Code of Criminal Procedure further provides for extraordinary appeals for civil review or on the grounds of denial of justice. The Government points out that since Mr. Fernando de la Rosa had not appealed to the Supreme Court, the case is closed.
.The Committee considered this case at its sessions in February and May , submitting interim reports on each occasion (paragraphs  to  of its th Report, and paragraphs  to  of its th Report).
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the allegations still outstanding concern the imprisonment of Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, Workers' Education Secretary of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation. According to the WFTU, he was imprisoned, although he had not been convicted by any court of law, in April  and has remained in prison ever since, although his release was ordered in April .
.The Government, in the observations it made on  October , stated that trade union organisation was free in the Dominican Republic, provided that both in their rules and their activities the unions observed ""a democratic organisation compatible with Constitutional principles and purposes pertaining strictly to the field of labour"". The Government had always complied with the provisions of Convention No. , by authorising the development, without interference, of all trade union organisations conforming with national labour legislation. However, it submitted no observations concerning the allegations relating to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa.
.At its session in February , the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to comment on these allegations, indicating what had happened to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa and whether he had been brought before a national court of law; if he had been, then the Government should be asked to supply a copy of the verdict rendered.
.With its letter dated  April , the Government sent a photocopy of the verdict rendered against Mr. Fernando de la Rosa. The latter, it said, had served his sentence, but the Secretary of State for Labour knew nothing of his whereabouts. At its session in May , the Committee concluded from the verdict rendered that on  April  Mr. Fernando de la Rosa had been sentenced to six months' imprisonment for breach of Acts Nos. ,  and  of . There was nothing in the verdict to indicate the nature of these Acts or the charges brought against the accused.
.In paragraph  of its th Report, the Committee noted that the accused was at liberty. Nevertheless, so as to be able to submit its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts, it recommended the Governing Body to request the Government for information about the legislation which the accused was said to have infringed, and about the events as a result of which he had been sent to prison for six months.
.In a letter dated  October , the Government confined itself to sending a further copy of the verdict of the court of first instance on Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, together with a copy of the judgment given by the Appeals Court. This latter judgment, dated  July , increased the sentence to one year's imprisonment, but it contained no more information than the first judgment about the content of the legislation infringed (Acts Nos. ,  and  of ) or about the charges brought against the accused.
.In a letter dated  January , the Government sent a copy of Act No.  dated  October , as amended by Acts Nos.  and  dated  and  November , on the basis of which the accused had been sentenced. This Act, as amended, outlaws the Communist Party and associations pursuing destructive ends or conspiring against the sovereignty of the nation. It prescribes terms of imprisonment for those who carry on propaganda on behalf of bodies banned by law.
.The Committee has always taken the view that it was not competent to consider purely political allegations, but that it could and should consider action of a political nature taken by governments in so far as such action might affect the exercise of trade union rights.
.In this particular instance, the Committee observes that the accused was sent to prison for a year on the basis of laws outlawing the Communist Party and making those who carry on propaganda in favour of banned associations liable to imprisonment. But there is nothing in the verdicts rendered to indicate the specific events for which the accused had been held responsible. This is the more regrettable in that the Government has not provided the information asked for about the actual circumstances which led to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa's conviction.
.In this connection, the Committee feels obliged to recall, as it has already done in another case concerning the Dominican Republic, that the aim of its procedure is to ensure respect for freedom of association in law as well as in fact. It is convinced that just as this procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above, and to deplore the fact that neither the Government's comments nor the verdicts rendered contain any specific information about the actual circumstances which led to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa's conviction, as a result of which the Committee is unable to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.The Committee has already examined this case at its session in February , at which time it submitted to the Governing Body a report contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report (approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, February-March ).
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.",0,1972,Dominican Republic
33,").
.It was alleged in the complaint, sent on  July , that Mr. Julio de Pena Valdez, Secretary-General of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation (FOUPSA-CESITRADO) had been arrested and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. The reason for this arrest and subsequent sentence was that he had allegedly conspired against the safety of the State and been in possession of war material. In fact, according to the complainants, Mr de Pea Valdez, as he himself stated in a letter to the World Federation of Trade Unions, had apparently been condemned because he was the most representative leader of the revolutionary proletariat, because he was the leader of class-conscious trade unionism and because he was ""in the forefront of the fight against the oligarchy - the lackey of imperialism - which is despotically governing"" the Dominican Republic. In his letter to the WFTU Mr de Pena Valdez alleged that for nine months he had been kept ""in a solitary underground cell in inhuman conditions - naked, without air and light, totally isolated"". It was also alleged that Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, Secretary for Workers' Education of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation, was in prison although he had been acquitted by the courts; he was said to have been arrested in April , and even though his release had been ordered a year later he was still in prison.
.In its observations of  October  the Government declared first of all that by virtue of article , paragraph , subparagraph (a), of the National Constitution there was freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, provided that in their bylaws as in their conduct the trade unions observed a democratic organisation compatible with the principles affirmed in the Constitution and strictly for labour ends. The Government stated that it had always respected the provisions of Convention No.  by allowing the free development, without official interference, of all trade union organisations which complied with the national labour legislation. As far as the case of Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez was concerned, he had been found guilty by the competent courts of the crime of possessing and trafficking in arms. The Government made no comment upon the allegations concerning Mr. Fernando de la Rosa.
.At its session in February  the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to supply the text of the judgement rendered against Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez as well as its observations concerning the allegations relating to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, indicating what his present situation was and whether he had appeared before a national court, in which case the Government should supply the text of the judgement rendered.
.By a communication dated  April , the Government forwarded copies of the judgements rendered against these two persons, stating that Mr. Fernando de la Rosa had already served his sentence and the Secretariat of State for Labour did not know his present address.
.The Committee observes that according to the text of the judgement rendered against Mr. Fernando de la Rosa he was sentenced on  April  to six months' corrective detention for breaches of Acts Nos. ,  and  of . The judgement gives no details as to the terms of these Acts or as to the offences Mr de la Rosa is said to have committed.
.As concerns Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez, the text of the judgement of the Court of Appeal of Santo Domingo, dated  October , indicates that he was sentenced, together with other persons, to three years' imprisonment and payment of a fine for having in his possession war materials and firearms, in pursuance of the provisions of section , subsection IV, of Act No. , as amended by Act No. , and section  of the Penal Code. This judgement of the Court of Appeal amends the judgement of the court of first instance, which had imposed a ten-year sentence for the same offence.
.The complaint of the world Federation of Trade Unions is contained in a communication dated  July  addressed direct to the International Labour Organisation. This complaint was transmitted to the Government, which submitted its observations thereon in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It is alleged that Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez, Secretary-General of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation (FOUPSA-CESITRADO), was arrested and sentenced to ten years' imprisonment. The reason for this arrest and sentence was that he had allegedly conspired against the security of the State and had been in possession of war material. In fact, say the complainants, Mr de Pea Valdez, as he states in a letter sent to the World Federation of Trade Unions, was apparently condemned because he was the most representative leader of the revolutionary proletariat, because he was the leader of class-conscious trade unionism and because he was ""in the forefront of the fight against the oligarchy - dependants of imperialism - which governs despotically"" in the Dominican Republic. In the letter which he sent to the WFTU, Mr de Pea Valdez alleged that during nine months he was kept ""in a solitary underground cell in inhuman conditions: naked, without air and light, and totally isolated"".
.It is also alleged that Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, Secretary for Workers' Education of the Dominican National Workers' Confederation, was imprisoned although no tribunal had considered that there were any charges against him; this person is alleged to have been in prison since April , and, though his release was ordered to take place a year later, in April , it is alleged that he is still detained.
.In its comments the Government states, first of all, that by virtue of Article , paragraph , subparagraph (a), of the National Constitution, the trade union movement in the Dominican Republic is free, provided that in their statutes as in their activities the trade unions observe a democratic organisation compatible with the principles affirmed in the Constitution and strictly for labour ends. The Government points out that it has always respected the provisions of Convention No.  by allowing the development without any interference of all trade union organisations which conform with national labour legislation.
.As far as the case of Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez is concerned, the Government states that the competent tribunals found him guilty of the crime of possessing and trafficking in arms.
.In accordance with the practice it has always followed, the Committee, considering that such information would be useful for judging whether the allegations were founded or not, recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to supply the text of the judgement rendered against Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez as well as the grounds adduced therefor.
.As for the allegations concerning the case of Mr. Fernando de la Rosa (see paragraph  above), the Committee notes that the Government refrains in its reply from making any observations on this aspect of the case.
.The Committee considers that it should recall at this stage that in all cases where trade union leaders are preventively detained these measures may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and wishes to draw attention to the fact that it has always emphasised the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to submit its observations concerning the allegations relating to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, indicating the present situation of this person, stating whether he has appeared before a national court, and, if so, to supply the text of the judgement rendered as well as the grounds adduced therefor.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to be good enough to supply the text of the judgement rendered against Mr. Julio de Pea Valdez as well as the grounds adduced therefor;(b) to request the Government to be good enough to submit its observations concerning the allegations relating to Mr. Fernando de la Rosa, indicating the present situation of this person, stating whether he has appeared before a national court, and, if so, to supply the text of the judgement rendered as well as the grounds adduced therefor;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the additional information specified in the two preceding subparagraphs.Geneva,  February .

34,"recall the observations which it made in paragraph  of its First Report, namely, ""the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward"".
.The Committee deplores the fact that despite the lapse of time since the complaint was submitted and the urgency of the requests made by the Committee to the Government to supply its observations on the allegations contained in the complaint, the Government has now submitted a reply which, in the opinion of the Committee, does not contain sufficient information to enable the Committee to reach its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts.
.The Committee would draw the attention of the Government to the provisions of Article  of Convention No.  according to which countries having ratified this Convention (of which Costa Rica is one) undertake to take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that workers, including public servants, may exercise freely the right to organise.
.The Committee would also stress that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures - and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.,
.The Committee considers that, in view of the circumstances of the case and the nature of the information now supplied by the Government, before reaching any conclusions on the matter, it would prefer to have any further comments which the complainants might wish to make on the information supplied by the Government. It accordingly recommends that the substance of the Government's reply be transmitted to the complainants for this purpose.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to recall the observations made by the Committee in its First Report, quoted in paragraph  above;(b) to deplore the fact that, despite the lapse of time since the complaint was submitted and the urgency of the repeated requests made by the Committee to the Government to supply its observations, the Government has now submitted a reply which does not contain sufficient information to enable the Committee to reach its conclusions on the matter in full knowledge of the facts;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraphs  and  above; and(d) to decide, for the reasons expressed in paragraph  above, to transmit to the complainants the substance of the communication of the Government, dated  May , for any further comments they might wish to make thereon.",1,1972,Costa Rica
35,".The complaint of the National Convention of Workers of Uruguay was contained in a telegram received on  October . This complaint was transmitted to the Government, which submitted its observations on the subject in a communication dated  November .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that the National Convention of Workers of Uruguay had invited two Hungarian trade union leaders to visit their country. These two leaders had consequently requested visas from the Embassy of Uruguay in Budapest, but more than a month later the request had not been granted. The complainants considered that this attitude constituted an infringement of elementary trade union rights.
.In its observations the Government categorically denies the facts alleged by the complainants. On the basis of information supplied by the Chancellery it maintains that the visas requested had been granted in good time and that the administrative formalities referring to the granting of such visas had been carried out within the normal time limits.
.In the light of information available to the Committee it would appear that the visas requested by the Hungarian trade union leaders, invited by the complainants to visit Uruguay, were finally granted even if delays might have occurred at the outset.
.In these circumstances, and without expressing an opinion on the substance of the matter, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, since the question raised in the case has been resolved in a manner corresponding to the wish of the complainants, to decide that no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of the case.",0,1972,Uruguay
36,".The complaint of the Latin American Central of Workers is contained in a communication dated  June . This complaint was supported by the World Confederation of Labour in a communication, dated  August .
.The Government submitted its observations on the complaint in a communication dated  March .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state that they were informed by their national member organisation of Uruguay that on  May  one of their best active trade unionists, Mr. Luis Batalla, who worked in the construction industry, died as a result of torture inflicted upon him in a barracks situated in the interior of the country. According to the complainants, the post mortem revealed that his liver had been ruptured, that he had cuts on the head and the heels and numerous bruises over his entire body caused by the ill-treatment he had received.
.The observations of the Government on this complaint are very detailed and are summarised as follows: Mr. Luis Carlos Batalla had been detained on  May  on account of his membership of a subversive organisation self-styled the National Liberation Movement (Tupamaros). The investigation revealed that he had been recruited for this organisation approximately a year previously. After carrying out information tasks of relative significance, he acquired greater importance within this subversive movement acting as a recruiter and head of a group. On  April  he went under cover and joined a camp of this organisation. There, and subsequently in the city of Treinta y Tres, he plotted the death of an officer of the armed forces and a police officer as well as the capture of a radio transmitter in order to explain the causes of this act.
.On  May  his capture was requested through the intervention of the police and, between that date and  May, when he was arrested, he remained in hiding in various places. His death occurred on  May  in a military unit of the department of Treinta y Tres. Mr. Batalla had fainted after having been taken out of the place where he had been interrogated and had hit the edge of a flowerbed. The head of the Health Service of the military unit concerned diagnosed ""death through a possible cardio-vascular or cerebral attack"" since he did not present any external signs that might indicate another cause. That same night measures were taken to call in the military investigating judge, who ordered a post mortem. This was carried out on  May, the findings being ""death through acute anaemia caused by a rupture of the liver"". According to the doctor it was necessary to take into account the blow sustained when he fell in a faint and the state of obvious weakness due to malnutrition and fatigue as a result of his being a fugitive.
.The chief of the military region concerned immediately went to Montevideo to see the Minister of National Defence. As a result of this interview it was decided that he should personally carry out an exhaustive investigation into the facts and immediately remove the commanders and officers who were presumed to be involved in the case.
.According to information received from the military investigating judge inquiries were being continued in order to clarify the facts in accordance with the preliminary procedure.
.The Government in its communication stated that the fact that had led to the complaint in question was part of the picture of grave terrorist subversion against which the forces required under the Constitution and the laws to defend national legal order had been called upon to struggle undauntedly. It was not a question of fighting a delinquency accustomed to committing criminal offences by ordinary means, or openly opposing public authority. It was a question of dealing with one of the most perfected forms of terrorism, perhaps even the most perfected in the world and, without a doubt, the most dangerous and intolerant. During the struggle hundreds of suspects had passed through the investigating courts, the numbers of investigations, searches, interrogations, etc., growing till truly unusual figures had been reached. All this had required, it should be recalled, laborious, self-sacrificing and risky work and the keeping of hours which usually left no time for the minimum of rest.
.The Government concludes by saying that, in addition to carrying out the administrative and judicial investigations, Parliament exercised the control functions that are proper to it. The Minister of National Defence was required to explain to the Chamber of Representatives the circumstances of the death of Mr. Batalla and after the information had been given the Chamber approved the following motion: ""The Chamber of Representatives expresses its confidence that the armed forces of the Republic , in accordance with their unchanging historic tradition, will comply with the Constitutional and legal standards which lay down in all circumstances respect for the dignity of the human person. And in the face of the lamentable facts which led to the question raised in the Chamber, facts that make it clear that a citizen died through the ill-treatment received during his detention, it demands utmost speed in the proceedings and the public disclosure of those guilty and the penalties imposed upon them.""
.The Committee takes note of this information and cannot but deplore the circumstances surrounding the death of Luis Carlos Batalla as narrated in the statement made by the Government. The Committee has repeatedly pointed out that it should be the policy of every government to ensure observance of the rights of man, and especially, of the right of all detained or accused persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The safeguards of normal judicial procedure should not only be embodied in the law, but also applied in practice. Similarly, the Committee has always emphasised the importance it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences. With respect to allegations of ill-treatment, the Committee has pointed out the importance it attaches to the right of trade unionists, as of all other persons, to enjoy the guarantees afforded by due process of law in accordance with the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
.In any case the Committee considers that in the present case it has received from the Government information which shows sufficiently precisely that the measures taken had no connection with the exercise of trade union activities but were the result of activities carried out by Mr. Luis Carlos Batalla and unconnected with trade unions.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the detailed information supplied by the Government and to deplore the circumstances surrounding the death of Luis Carlos Batalla as narrated in the information concerned;(b) to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principles set out in paragraph ; and(c) to decide, for the reasons indicated in paragraph , that this case does not require further examination.",0,1972,Uruguay
37,".The joint complaint of the Confederation of State Officials' Organisations and the National Federation of Municipal Workers and Employees is contained in a communication dated  March  addressed direct to the ILO. By a communication dated  April  the complainants through the National Convention of Workers of Uruguay submitted additional information in support of their complaint. The text of these communications was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations thereon in a communication dated  August .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants' protest is essentially against the reintroduction of Decree No.  of  June , which lays down economic sanctions, along with the obligation to work, in the case of strikes or stoppages by civil servants. In the opinion of the complainants, this text is contrary to the Constitutional guarantees, which include the right to strike.
.In its comments the Government states that in Uruguay the principle that strikes by civil servants are illegal is derived from article , paragraph , of the Constitution and that Decree No.  of  June  is based on the said principle. The Government continues to state: ""Nevertheless, while strikes are illegal, machinery exists to permit civil servants to enjoy the most extensive rights of association, submit their claims, and obtain adequate and proper satisfaction by means expressly provided for by law (Act No.  dated  December , sections  and )."" The Government points out in conclusion that, ""in addition, it has taken the initiative on a number of occasions not to enforce the financial sanctions provided for in the above Decree"".
.The Committee has already had before it a case involving Uruguay which referred to a similar situation and where reference was made to Act No.  of , mentioned by the Government in the present case.
.On that occasion, in view of the statement by the Government that strikes in the civil service are not permitted, the Committee, considering that the allegations concerning the right to strike fall within its competence, although only to the extent to which they affect trade union rights, considered it necessary to recall that, while restrictions on strikes in the civil service or in essential services could be accepted, there should in this case be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who were thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, which implied that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned could participate at all stages.
.As for the means by which workers deprived of the right to strike could obtain a settlement of their claims, the Committee noted - as is also the case in the present complaint - that the information supplied by the Government refers solely to sections  and  of Act No.  instituting conciliation procedures.
.In the circumstances the Committee can only reach the same conclusion as that which it reached following its examination of the previous case referred to above, by recommending the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that where strikes are forbidden in the civil service or in essential services such prohibition should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.",0,1972,Uruguay
38,".The complaint of the Costa Rican Confederation of Democratic Workers is contained in a communication dated  June . It was transmitted to the Government, which replied by a communication dated  July , to which was appended a considerable quantity of documentation relating to the case.
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their complaint the complainants merely allege that leaders of the National Union of Employees of the Costa Rican Social Insurance Fund (UNDECA) have been arrested and dismissed because of their refusal to accept the intransigent attitude of the Minister of Labour and of the Executive Board and Management of the Social Insurance Fund. The complainants request urgent ILO intervention to examine the case.
.In its reply the Government states that in February  a direct agreement was signed between the Costa Rican Social Insurance Fund and the UNDECA in which the UNDECA undertook, in exchange for benefits obtained, not to promote until February  ""any collective dispute of an economic and social nature"". Nevertheless, in April  the UNDECA filed a series of claims in which it demanded various financial improvements. Notwithstanding the undertaking that had been given, the Executive Board of the Fund agreed to examine this list of claims, although it requested a longer time limit for the negotiations than the twenty-two days demanded by the union. At the beginning of May, while the negotiations were in progress, the union threatened to launch a series of strikes, which it in fact did on  May .
.The Government goes on to state that the management of the fund referred the matter to the labour tribunal, which declared this strike action to be illegal on the ground that the union had not exhausted the conciliation procedure prescribed by law (section  of the Labour Code) as well as on the ground that the employees of the Fund, like other persons employed by a public service, do not enjoy the right to strike (article  of the Constitution and section  of the Labour Code). Section  of the Labour Code classifies as being public services all services performed by employees of the State or its institutions, where the activities in question are not also carried on by private profit-making undertakings.
.The Government states that following on this judgement the strike was terminated and negotiations were reopened. Nevertheless, in June the union launched a further strike, which was likewise ruled to be illegal by the labour tribunal. On this second occasion the union went so far as to besiege the head office of the Fund and some of its hospital centres, endangering the health and even the lives of the patients. In consequence, the Fund was compelled to dismiss some of the workers and union leaders, since they had defaulted in their duties as employees in the hospital centres. It was this situation which prompted the request for the intervention of the police in order to safeguard order and the interests of the patients. The strike was ended and talks were resumed, but the union has already announced yet another stoppage.
.The Government concludes by stating that, since at no time was the life or freedom of any person involved in the dispute endangered, there is no cause to consider this case an urgent case in accordance with the classification established by the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.The Committee has established the principle that allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they concern the exercise of trade union rights. As concerns the right to strike in essential services or in the civil service, the Committee has pointed out that, where strikes are forbidden or subject to restriction in such sectors, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard to the full the interests of the workers thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests. The Committee has also pointed out that the restriction or prohibition in question should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures, in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented. The Committee has also expressed the view that legislation which provides for compulsory conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes before a strike may be called cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association.
.The Committee observes that the employees of the Costa Rican Social Insurance Fund, in their capacity as employees of a public service, do not enjoy the right to strike and that, on the contrary, any disputes in which they may be involved must compulsorily be dealt with by the labour tribunals (section  of the Labour Code). The Committee also observes that, according to the Government, at no time was the freedom of the persons participating in the strike movements launched by the UNDECA endangered.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that, in the light of the principles set forth in paragraph  above with respect to strikes in public services, it cannot be considered that there has been any infringement of trade union rights in the present case. The Committee accordingly recommends the Governing Body to decide that the allegations, and consequently the case as a whole, do not call for further examination.",1,1972,Costa Rica
39,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  March , which was transmitted to the Government on  April . The Government sent its observations in three communications dated  August  and  January and  April .
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their complaint, the complainants indicate that the manual and non-manual workers of the Autonomous National University of Mexico decided to set up a federal trade union, and with this purpose in view they drafted the statutes, held a constituent assembly on  November  and elected their first executive committee, approving the above-mentioned statutes in the assembly in question. On  November , they requested the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security to register the above-mentioned trade union. On  January , the Secretariat communicated its refusal to register the trade union, indicating that the National Autonomous University of Mexico was not an undertaking under the direct or decentralised administration of the federal Government, and that for this and other reasons, the workers of the university were not covered by the federal Labour Law. The complainants state that they have appealed to the federal Court but in any case, they request the ILO to intervene as they consider that the refusal to register the trade union is a breach of Convention No. .
.In its first communication dated  August , the Government confirmed that an appeal had been lodged against the decision of the Secretariat for Labour and Social Security and indicated that the proceedings had not been concluded. The Government also sent the text of the decision in question. In its communication of  January , the Government declared that an agreement had been signed between the workers and the university authorities putting an end to the strike initiated by the workers. At the same time, the Government stated that it would send additional information.
.Finally, in its communication of  April , the Government sent information concerning the result of the appeal and the text of the decision. The Government states that the complainants had considered that the trade union which they had set up was made up of workers employed by a federal undertaking and consequently this called for an intervention on the part of the federal authorities, which are competent to apply labour laws to ""undertakings administered either directly or in a decentralised manner by the federal Government"". The Secretariat for Labour and Social Security considered that the university concerned was not an ""undertaking"" for the purposes of the law and consequently did not consider itself competent to register the trade union. On  March , the Court rendered a judgement on the appeal in favour of the complainants. Consequently, the refusal to register remains without effect and the trade union will be registered unless an appeal is lodged against the judgement and the judgement is revoked. The Government states that it does not expect an appeal to be lodged.
.To sum up, the result of the judgement rendered on the appeal is that the Autonomous National University of Mexico must be considered subject to federal jurisdiction and that as far as the application of labour laws is concerned, the federal authorities are competent.
.The Committee is not competent to decide on the interpretation which should be given to the laws of a country, but only to give its opinion concerning whether a situation does or does not conform to international principles and standards in the field of freedom of association. Whatever the laws of a country may be, they should not impair, or be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided in Convention No. , which include the right of all workers without distinction and without previous authorisation to establish organisations of their own choice. As has been pointed out in the preparatory work of the Convention, member States are free to determine in their legislation the formalities which seem to them appropriate to ensure the normal operation of all occupational organisations. Consequently, the formalities provided in national regulations concerning the constitution and operation of organisations are compatible with the provisions of the Convention provided always that these regulations are not in contradiction with the guarantees provided in the Convention. At the same time, in accordance with the provisions of Article  of this instrument, every country for which it is in force undertakes to adopt all measures necessary and appropriate in order to guarantee the free exercise of the right of association.
.In this case, the complainants have been able to have recourse to justice against the administrative decision which affected them, and according to information submitted by the Government, there are now practically no obstacles to the trade union concerned being registered and being able to operate legally. In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not require further examination.",0,1972,Mexico
40,".The Committee examined this case in November  and presented to the Governing Body at that session an interim report which is reproduced in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, dated  July , the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation alleged that the Government was carrying out a systematic persecution of trade union leaders in Costa Rica in spite of the provisions in the Labour Code. It cited the example of Gilberto Rodriguez Arias, President of the Union of Civil Service Employees (UNESECI). Mr. Rodriguez began trade union activities in  when he was a Class  Public Administration Officer in the Personnel Selection Branch of the Public Service Commission and he was responsible in large part for the founding in  of the UNESECI. The complainants went on to state that Mr. Rodriguez had been transferred on several occasions after February  and had been informed in June  that his job had ceased to exist and that he was consequently dismissed. These actions had been taken as a result of Mr. Rodriguez's trade union activities.
.In its communication dated  May  the Government pointed out that an inquiry had been initiated in connection with this matter, but this inquiry had subsequently been suspended since the person concerned, having stated that any action would be pointless, declined to produce any documentary evidence. This being the case, continued the Government, it had not been possible to establish whether, in reality, any trade union persecution had taken place as alleged.
.In its th Report the Committee had deplored the fact that despite the lapse of time since the complaint was submitted and the urgency of the requests made by the Committee, the reply which was submitted by the Government did not contain sufficient information to enable the Committee to reach its conclusions on the matter in the full knowledge of the facts. It had drawn the attention of the Government to the provisions of Article  of Convention No.  according to which the countries (of which Costa Rica is one) having ratified this Convention undertake to take all necessary and appropriate measures to ensure that workers - including public servants - may exercise freely the right to organise. The Committee had also stressed that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures, and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. The Committee has considered that the guarantee of such protection in the case of trade union officials is also necessary in order to ensure that effect is given to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.In view of the circumstances of the case and the nature of the information supplied by the Government, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body, inter alia, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations expressed in the preceding paragraph and to transmit to the complainants the substance of the Government's communication for any further comments they might wish to make thereon.
.Despite several requests addressed to the complainants, no comments have been received from them on the Government's reply. The Committee notes that the complaint dates from  July  and it considers that, since no comments have been received from the complainants, it is not in possession of sufficient information to enable it to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination on its part.
.The complaint of the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation (COCC) is contained in a communication dated  July  addressed to the Director-General of the ILO.
.The Committee recalls that, at its meeting in November , it addressed an urgent appeal to the Government to supply its observations on the allegations contained in the complaint, the Government having failed to reply to the repeated requests of the Committee to supply such observations (th Report, paragraph ). The Committee also recalls that at its meeting in February , since no reply had been received to its appeal, and in accordance with the rule of procedure contained in paragraph  of its th Report, it informed the Government that it might submit a report on the substance of the matter at its next session even if the observations requested had not been received. By a communication dated  May  the Government transmitted its observations on the allegations made in the complaint.
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint the Costa Rican Christian Workers' and Peasants' Confederation alleges that there is a systematic persecution of trade union leaders in Costa Rica in spite of the provisions in the Labour Code directed against such discrimination. It cites the example of Gilberth Rodriguez Arias, President of the Union of Civil Service Employees (UNESECI). Mr. Rodriguez began trade union activities in  when he was a Class  Public Administration Officer in the Personnel Selection Branch of the Public Service Commission and he was responsible in large part for the founding in March  of the UNESECI, of which he was elected President.
.Just before this, in February , he was transferred to the Recruitment Section and this transfer is alleged to have been both a demotion in real terms and in violation of the Civil Service Statute which provides that no civil servant can be transferred to another position or be given an increased workload for a period of more than two months. It is alleged also that this transfer was motivated by a desire to discourage Mr. Rodriguez from pursuing his trade union activities.
.During March and April of  there is alleged to have been some friction between Mr. Rodriguez and the management of the Civil Service in relation to hours of work and similar issues. On  May of that year the Director of the Civil Service, Mr. Sidney Brautigam Jimnez, sent a note to Mr. Rodriguez in which the latter is accused of prejudicing the Civil Service and those employed in it. Mr. Rodriguez replied to the Director expressing his surprise and explaining that there must have been a serious misunderstanding.
.The complainants annex to their letter copies of notes sent to the Transport Minister and to the National Association of Public Employees, in which Mr. Brautigam attests to the professional competence of Mr. Rodriguez; they point out that these communications directly contradict the reasons given to Mr. Rodriguez by Mr. Brautigam for the former's transfer to the Recruitment Section several months earlier. In July , Mr. Brautigam proposed transferring Mr. Rodriguez to the Transport Ministry and in spite of petitions by the UNESECI and certain members of the Legislative Assembly explaining that such a transfer would leave the union leaderless, Mr. Rodriguez was sent to the Transport Ministry on  October , to a job involving personnel classification which was not his special field.
.On  December , Mr. Rodriguez was once again transferred, this time to the Planning Office where his duties did not correspond at all with his professional qualifications. Finally, on  June , he was informed by Mr. Brautigam that as a result of the approval of a Special Budget by the Legislative Assembly, his job had ceased to exist and that he was consequently dismissed.
.The complainants claim that Mr. Rodriguez has been victimised because of his trade union activities and that the provisions of the Special Budget, reducing the number of positions for persons of Mr. Rodriguez's qualifications from five to four with the consequent dismissal, merely constituted a pretext for getting rid of him so that he could no longer lead the trade union of which he was President.
.In its communication dated  May  the Government points out that an inquiry was initiated in connection with this matter, but that this inquiry was subsequently suspended since the person concerned, having stated that any action would not be productive, declined to produce any documentary evidence. This being the case, continues the Government, it is not possible to establish whether, in reality, any trade union persecution took place as alleged.
.The Committee considers it appropriate to",1,1972,Costa Rica
41,"an objective verification of any claim by a union that it represents the majority of the workers in an undertaking, provided such a claim appears to be plausible. If the union concerned is found to be the majority union, the authorities should take appropriate conciliatory measures with a view to obtaining the employer's recognition of that union for collective bargaining purposes.
.In the circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth above, and in particular to the considerations set forth in paragraph , and to request the Government to indicate, within a period of six months, what steps, if any, have been taken or are being considered to establish a procedure such as that indicated in paragraph  above.",0,1972,Jamaica
42,".The complaint of the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) is contained in a communication dated  July  addressed direct to the ILO. This complaint was supported by the World Confederation of Labour in a communication dated  July . The complaint was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations thereon in a communication dated  August .
.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state that when the first Latin American Peasants' Conference on Agrarian Reform, convened and organised by the Latin American Federation of Peasants, was being held at Quito from  June to  July , Mr. Eduardo Garcia Moure, Deputy Secretary-General of the Latin American Central of Workers, took the floor to open the Conference and analysed the situation of the peasants in Latin America as well as in the process of agrarian reform. He came to the conclusion that the peasants were now worse off than before because the process of agrarian reform remained in the hands of minorities which did not desire a change, and the peasants did not participate in this process.
.According to the complainants, Colonel Hernn Torres Bonilla, Executive Director of the Ecuadorian Institute of Agrarian Reform and Settlement, who was present at the sitting, interpreted these words as a lack of respect for himself and for the armed forces of his country, ""an interpretation"" the complainants add ""which we can but reject, since at no time was there any reference to any particular situation and certainly not to the situation of Ecuador or its armed forces"".
.The complainants allege that, at the end of the sitting, Colonel Torres Bonilla uttered threats against Mr. Eduardo Garcia Moure and all those attending the Conference. Three days later, continue the complainants, Mr. Eduardo Garcia Moure was arrested by three agents who took him to the headquarters of the political police, where he was questioned, after which he was imprisoned, put in solitary confinement and deported without having the possibility of speaking to fellow members of the Conference or to a magistrate ""and without being allowed to fetch his papers and luggage, while all the money he had on him had been confiscated"".
.In its observations the Government confines itself to stating that the reason for which the measures referred to in the complaint were taken was that, by virtue of the legislation in force, foreigners are forbidden to interfere in matters of domestic policy - an offence of which the person concerned had been guilty in criticising the agrarian reform policy of Ecuador.
.The Committee notes that the Government refrains from giving any indication concerning the nature of the statement alleged to have been made by Mr. Eduardo Garcia Moure and which in the opinion of the Government would have justified his deportation. The Committee notes that the complainants, for their part, maintain that in his statement Mr. Eduardo Garcia Moure confined himself to generalities and had, at no time, referred to Ecuador or its policy.
.While admitting that there may be justification for legislation forbidding the interference of foreigners in the internal affairs of the country, the Committee considers that it is important that such legislation should be applied solely for the purposes for which it had been enacted, and that it should not be used in such a way as to impair the free exercise of trade union rights. Such a provision is contained in Article , paragraph , of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), according to which the law of the land shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in this Convention.
.In addition, the International Labour Conference pointed out that the right of assembly, freedom of opinion and expression and, in particular, freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media constitute civil liberties which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that, according to the complainants, Mr. Eduardo Garcia Moure confined himself to referring in general terms to the question which was the subject matter of a legally held conference, whereas the Government, while maintaining that he had interfered in the domestic policy of the country, does not supply any further information on the subject and does not expressly deny the facts as stated by the complainants.
.In the circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations contained in paragraphs  and  above.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1972,Ecuador
43,".The Committee examined this case in February and May , when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report and addendum to that report given in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of the addendum to the th Report.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the allegations related to an event which occurred before the change in government on  September , involving mainly the following facts. A group of sixteen trade unionists who, at a union meeting, had voted against the government takeover of the firm for which they worked, were prevented from entering their place of work by other workers in the firm. Confronted with this situation, the controller of the undertaking decided to dismiss ten of the trade unionists and set in motion the legal procedure to secure the waiving of the provisions concerning trade union immunity from dismissal in the case of the other six (five of whom were trade union leaders). Shortly afterwards, these leaders gave up their trade union functions on being censured by a union meeting, thereby losing the right, as trade unionists, to immunity against dismissal. Subsequently, one of them resigned from his employment and the other four were dismissed ""for reasons of service"".
.From the information available, it would appear that the action taken by the controller of the firm against the trade unionists was motivated partly by the need to deal with the situation that had arisen when the workers refused to allow the trade unionists to enter the undertaking. It would also appear, however, that these measures were applied as a penalty for the attitude taken at a trade union meeting against the takeover ordered by the Government. The Committee considered that a distinction should be made between, on the one hand, the responsibility of trade unionists towards their organisation in the event of its rules being infringed and, on the other hand, the actions of such trade unionists which might constitute failure to respect obligations inherent in their employment relations. If a particular form of behaviour on the part of certain members or leaders within the trade union organisation did not at the same time constitute a violation of their duties as workers, the penalties that might, on such grounds, be applied to them by an employer would amount to acts of discrimination likely to undermine freedom of association in connection with employment and workers should be protected against such acts.
.The Committee observed that the sixteen workers referred to in the complaint had appealed to the courts for recognition of their rights and that the relevant proceedings were still pending. It considered that the decisions reached were likely to provide it with further information on which to base its conclusions and recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in the preceding paragraph and to request it to provide the texts of the court decisions together with the grounds adduced therefor.
.In a communication of  February , the Government made certain observations on the Committee's conclusions and requested that they be examined by the Governing Body in conjunction with the report on the case. The Government disagreed in particular with the Committee's considerations as set out in paragraph  above. It stated that the takeover had been carried out in agreement with the workers, so that it could in no way be supposed that it had wished to infringe freedom of association in connection with employment and that the employees in question had acted as agents of the firm taken over, which had, for political reasons, suspended the manufacture and distribution of its products.
.The Committee stated that it had taken into account the fact that the controller had suspended from employment five trade union leaders and the staff representative (pending a subsequent application to the courts for authorisation to dismiss them) and had decided to terminate the contract of employment of ten other employees who had voted with the former against the takeover, at a union meeting, on the grounds that they had ""repeatedly failed to show the loyalty due to their fellow workers and to the undertaking as regards both the production and the marketing of its products"". The Committee still considered that both the facts reported and the reasons given by the controller for dismissing trade unionists not enjoying special immunity revealed a relation of cause and effect between the attitude to the takeover taken by the leaders and members of the union and the measures taken against them by the controller. This attitude had been decided upon at a union meeting and had taken the concrete form of a vote against the takeover; it did not appear from the information available that there had been any further action on the part of those concerned, such as an individual or collective stoppage of work. In other words, it was an attitude taken by certain trade unionists within the context of their union activities and it had no bearing on the discharge of their duties under their contract of employment. The Committee specified that it had never considered the taking over of the firm by the Government as an act of anti-union discrimination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to take note of the Government's observations and to decide that it was appropriate to adhere to the conclusions reached previously.
.The Professional Trade Union of Employees of the Maipu factory of Rayn Said Industrias Quimicas SA addressed a further communication to the ILO on  March . It referred to the change in government which took place in Chile on  September  and stated that the dismissed workers had since been reinstated. On  March  the Government submitted a large volume of documentation on the matter including in particular the text of two judgments dated  February  and  February , ordering the undertaking to reinstate four of the dismissed workers and to pay the wages and allowances which would have been payable during the period in which work was suspended.
.The complainant organisation submitted its complaint to the ILO on  June . It was transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations on  October .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The trade union's complaint, signed by Mr. Andrs Leiva Leiva, in his capacity as President, and by Mr. Blas Crdenas Vsquez, as Secretary, states that, on  May  admission to the factory in which they worked was refused to  employees including the entire trade union Committee ( persons), the staff representative and  former trade union officials who still enjoyed trade union immunity from dismissal. This action, adds the complaint, was taken by the government official who had been appointed controller of the undertaking and who made use of a group of workers, whose credulity and ignorance he exploited. The complainants maintain that this constituted a breach of contract and of trade union immunity and restricted the right to work. Incidents of this kind, the complainants conclude, are a frequent occurrence in Chile in undertakings taken over by the Government.
.In its reply, the Government states that the Rayn Said textile firm was taken over by the Government because of the stoppage in the production and distribution of yarns, as a result of which these products were in short supply on the market. The purpose of the takeover was to restore to normal the production and distribution of the goods manufactured in the establishment. On  May  the union executive convened a meeting of its members to discuss the ending of the takeover. Out of  members,  attended,  of whom voted in favour of the repeal of the takeover decree. Two days later a general meeting was held, for all the workers in the firm, at which it was decided by the majority of all the wage earners and salaried employees to refuse admission to work to the  members of the union who had voted for the end of the takeover. Faced with this situation, the government-appointed controller of the firm terminated the contracts of employment of the ten employees who did not enjoy trade union immunity ""for having repeatedly failed to show the loyalty due to their fellow workers and to the undertaking as regards both the production and the marketing of its products"". At the same time, the controller informed the Labour Inspectorate of the decision to suspend the five leaders and the staff representative and requested authorisation from the courts for an exception to be made in the case of these persons to the legislative provisions applicable to workers enjoying trade union immunity against dismissal.
.On  July",0,1972,Chile
44,".When this case came before it at its meeting in November , the Committee decided to postpone consideration of it and asked the Director-General to secure additional information from both the complainants and the Government.
.The complaint was made in a letter dated  March  from the world Confederation of Labour to the Director-General. In two other communications, one dated  November  and the other  March , the World Confederation of Labour provided further information in support of the complaint.
.In two letters, one dated  May  and the other  December , the Government transmitted its comments.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its letter dated  March , the World Confederation of Labour alleged that on  February  five peasants were killed when the Special Security Force opened fire on them as they were peacefully tilling the land belonging to the Peasants' League of Talanquera, in the township of Juticalpa (Department of Olancho). Five others were seriously wounded. According to the complainants, the order to open fire had been given by the head of the local Special Security Force, under pressure from the landowners.
.In its communication dated  May , the Government did not deny that peasants had lost their lives in the shooting - in fact, six peasants and one soldier had been killed in the clash. This had taken place after the Special Security Force and Army units had begun to clear the peasants squatting on an estate, in accordance with orders given by the Head of the Juticalpa Regional Office of the National Agrarian Institute (INA).
.The Government also quoted the conclusions reached by a special Committee of inquiry, made up of a representative of the National Agrarian Institute, the Chairman of the National Peasants' Association of Honduras (ANACH), a representative of the armed forces, and two representatives of the Legislature, belonging to the Liberal Party and National Party respectively. The events of Juticalpa had taken place in an atmosphere of confusion, due to conflicts concerning rights of ownership and pre-emption with regard to land and aggravated by the slowness shown by the courts in settling the dispute.
.In its answer, the Government added that the events in question were caused by an unfortunate combination of circumstances which it could have done nothing to prevent. Nevertheless, the courts were continuing their inquiries with a view to determining criminal liability.
.At its meeting in November , the Committee asked the Director-General to request the complainants and the Government to indicate the nature of the organisation known as the Peasants' League of Talanquera and state whether it was a trade union organisation and whether the disputed title of ownership belonged to the League or to the peasants individually or collectively.
.In its letter dated  March , the World Confederation of Labour said that it was the favourable attitude of the head of the INA Regional office which had led the peasants to take possession of the land in question. There was a dispute between the peasants and two co-proprietors of adjacent lands, who claimed to have a right to these plots, which had previously been occupied by Salvadorian peasants. The problem was to decide whether the land in question was public land, as the peasants claimed, or part of the adjacent holdings, as the two landowners claimed.
.The latter, added the World Confederation of Labour, then called in the Special Security Force to evict the peasants. The peasants refused to leave, arguing that the parties had agreed to meet that same day ( February ) to reach an understanding. Army units then joined in and shooting broke out, as a result of which seven persons were killed.
.The World Confederation of Labour added that two legal cases were under way, one brought by the families of the deceased peasants against one of the two co-proprietors for murder, and the other brought by the Departmental Officer of the Special Security Force against certain peasants for disrespect of authority.
.In its communication dated  December , the Government declared that the organisation known as the Peasants' League of Talanquera was not registered as a trade union with the Ministry of Labour, and hence the Government was unable to say what its standing was in the eyes of the law. It appended to its communication a report on the matter by the Supreme Court of Justice.
.In the letter accompanying its report, the Supreme Court stated that nothing in the written or oral evidence established a relation between what happened at La Talanquera and the exercise of freedom of association in Honduras. In its report, the Court confirmed the account given by the complainants.
.The case now before the Committee is a very grave one, but the Committee has first to consider whether it involves a breach of freedom of association that can be examined under the procedure in force.
.As regards the organisation called the Peasants' League of Talanquera, to which the peasants in the case belonged, the Government declares that it is not registered as a trade union and its standing in the eyes of the law is unknown. The Committee has always taken the view that in deciding whether or not any given organisation is occupational in character it is not bound by any national definition of what constitutes an occupational organisation, and that for example, failure by an organisation to file its rules in accordance with national legislation would be no adequate reason for declaring a complaint irreceivable, since the principle of freedom of association demands that workers should not have to obtain prior authorisation before setting up organisations of their choice to promote and defend their interests. However, even if this particular league is considered to be a peasants' occupational organisation, it still remains to be decided whether the events complained of had anything to do with trade union activities. In this respect, the Committee observes that in the light of the information available, the peasants in question seem to have occupied land to which they claimed a right, that this land was at that time the object of legal proceedings, and that the peasants had been ordered to leave. They refused, whereupon a dispute arose that ended in violent repression by the police and army units.
.While the Committee fully recognises that these events were extremely serious, especially bearing in mind that the land in question had been occupied by the peasants with the approval of the local INA representative, it considers that the issue was not the exercise of trade union rights but rather a question of land ownership and tenure governed by specific national legislation having nothing to do with the problems of freedom of association.
.Accordingly, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case calls for no further examination on its part.",0,1972,Honduras
45,".This case has already been examined by the Committee, at its meeting in November . An interim report on it submitted to the Governing Body at that time is contained in paragraphs  to  of the th Report of the Committee.
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee recalls that the complaints of the Workers' Federation of Santander (FESTRA) and of the World Federation of Trade Unions were contained in two communications dated  May and  June . These complaints were transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations thereon on  January .
.With its complaint, the FESTRA enclosed a copy of a communication dated  May , sent to it from Bucaramanga Prison by thirteen petroleum workers who had been sentenced to several years' imprisonment for having taken part in a strike in August . According to the complainants, these workers were some of the thirty-six strikers sentenced by courts martial for alleged offences of edition and seizure of property. The complainants maintained that these trade unionists were all innocent of the offences with which they had been charged. These allegations were supported by the WFTU.
.In the first observations it made, the Government stated that the workers in question were in prison for having committed offences that came within the jurisdiction of the military courts. Anything connected with public order, declared the Government, was outside the labour sphere. Moreover, the Government concluded that relations between the employers and the Workers' Trade Union Federation (USO) - an organisation that appeared to have been involved in the aforementioned strike - were excellent and that a new collective agreement, of which it enclosed the text, had just then been signed.
.At its rd Session ( February ), the Committee took note of the Government's observations, but considered that more detailed information was necessary to enable it to express an opinion in full knowledge of the facts. It consequently requested the Director-General to ask the Government to furnish detailed information on the charges brought against the imprisoned workers and the procedure followed before the military courts, together with the text of the judgements rendered with reasons annexed.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government supplied the following information. The proceedings in which the workers were involved did not fall within the competence of the ordinary courts. The acts for which they had been tried had been committed while a state of siege was in force and were considered to be crimes of seizure of property and against the national economy, punishable by the military judicial authorities which had jurisdiction at the time and place where the events occurred. Consequently, the Ministry of Labour was not competent to intervene on any matter connected with the case.
.The Committee considered that the Government's observations still had not gone far enough to enable it to examine the substance of the case. It pointed out that, even if the matters raised in the complaint did not fall directly within the competence of the Ministry of Labour, the procedure for the protection of freedom of association was intended to ensure respect for such freedom in fact as well as in law in every context and that, in consequence, irrespective of the conditions under which these workers had been sentenced, the legislation in pursuance of which sentence had been pronounced or the authorities pronouncing sentence, the Committee must be in possession of the necessary information in order to be able to reach conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.The Committee accordingly recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to provide, through the competent authorities, additional information as to the facts which had led to the prosecution of these workers on charges of seizure of property and crimes against the national economy, the text of the provisions governing these offences and the procedure followed before the military courts, together with the text of the judgments rendered with reasons annexed.
.Two communications have been received from the Government, dated  October  and  January  respectively.
.In the first of these, the Government states that what occurred on  August  was that the employees of the Ecopetrol Refinery in Barrancabermeja went on an all-out strike over a dispute regarding management's failure to implement one of the terms of the collective agreement then in force. The strike was not, the Government continues, peaceful and the workers occupied the refinery. This occupation necessitated the intervention of the army garrison in Barrancabermeja and the company suffered considerable loss both in man-hours and damage to property. As a result several of the workers involved were charged before military courts in conformity with the law prevailing at the time the criminal acts took place.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government forwards the text of Act No.  of  December , which reads:
.""Those who were sentenced by the military Criminal Court for acts committed at the Refining and Petrochemical Industrial Complex in the El Centro Production District, under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Barrancabermeja on the th and th days of August  are hereby granted a full remission of sentence.
.""In return for the granting of the benefit extended in the present Act, the Government shall require those affected to give the pledge of good conduct provided for in section  of the Penal Code.
.""The orders giving effect to the above-mentioned remission of sentence and ordering the release of those concerned, shall be communicated to the Supreme Military Tribunal and the Supreme Court of Justice.""

.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.With its complaint, the FESTRA encloses a copy of a communication dated  May , sent to it from Bucaramanga Prison by thirteen petroleum workers who had been sentenced to several years' imprisonment for having taken part in a strike in August . According to the complainants, these workers are among the thirty-six strikers sentenced by courts martial for alleged offences of sedition and seizure of property. The complainants maintain that all these trade unionists are innocent of the offences with which they have been charged. Similar allegations are made by the WFTU.
.In the first observations it made, the Government stated that the workers in question were in prison for having committed offences that came within the jurisdiction of the military courts. Anything connected with public order, declared the Government, was outside the labour sphere. Moreover, the Government concluded, relations between the employers and the Workers' Trade Union Federation (USO) - an organisation that appears to have been involved in the aforementioned strike - were excellent, and a new collective agreement, of which it enclosed the text, had just been signed.
.At its rd Session ( February ), the Committee took note of the Government's observations, but considered that more detailed information was necessary to enable it to express an opinion in full knowledge of the facts. It consequently requested the Director-General to ask the Government to furnish detailed information on the charges brought against the imprisoned workers and the procedure followed before the military courts, together with the text of the judgements rendered with reasons annexed.
.In a communication dated  July , the Government supplies the following information. The proceedings in which the workers were involved did not fall within the competence of the ordinary courts. The acts for which they were tried were committed while a state of siege was in force and were considered to be crimes of seizure of property and against the national economy, punishable by the military judicial authorities which had jurisdiction at the time and at the place where the events occurred. Consequently, the Ministry of Labour was not competent to intervene on any matter connected with the present case.
.The Committee considers that the Government's observations still do not go far enough to enable it to examine the substance of the case. It wishes to point out that, even if the matters raised in the complaint do not fall directly within the competence of the Ministry of Labour, the procedure for the protection of freedom of association is intended to ensure respect for such freedom in fact as well as in law in every context and that, in consequence, irrespective of the conditions under which these workers were sentenced, the legislation in pursuance of which sentence was pronounced or the authorities pronouncing sentence, the Committee must be in possession of the necessary information in order to be able to reach conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.",0,1972,Colombia
46,"appear to be three main problems at issue in this case as far as freedom of association is concerned; the control of trade union funds and their freezing by order of the administrative authorities, the suspension of the legal personality of trade unions by administrative authority and the restriction of the right to strike.
.As regards trade union funds, the Committee has already observed in the past that, in general, trade union organisations appear to agree that legislative provisions requiring, for instance, financial statements to be annually presented to the authorities in a form prescribed by law, and the submission of other data on points which may not seem clear in the said statements, do not per se infringe trade union autonomy. However, as concerns other measures of administrative supervision such as special audits and investigations, the Committee has expressed the view that they should be applied only in exceptional cases when justified by grave circumstances - for instance presumed irregularities in the annual statement or irregularities reported by members of the organisation - so as to avoid any discrimination between one trade union and another and to preclude the danger of excessive intervention by the authorities which might hamper a union's exercise of the right to organise its administration freely, and also to avoid harmful and perhaps unjustified publicity or the disclosure of information which might be confidential.
.In the present case the inspections of trade union accounts carried out by the administrative authorities appear to have been directly related with the participation of the three organisations concerned in the collective dispute at AVIANCA. It is in fact to be seen from the information supplied by the Government that some of the irregularities discovered by the competent service relate to financial periods of a much earlier date and might have given grounds for the taking of certain measures, under the law, at the time they were perpetrated.
.On the other hand - and this leads to the second problem mentioned - in view of these irregularities the administrative authorities decided to suspend the legal personality of the three unions concerned. As already pointed out by the Committee, such action is incompatible with the principle that workers' organisations should not be liable to be suspended by administrative authority. This observation is equally applicable to the decision taken by the administrative authorities to ratify the suspension of legal personality in accordance with section  of the Labour Code when the strike at AVIANCA was declared to be unlawful.
.The Committee considers that if the administrative authorities discover, in circumstances of the kind described in paragraph , that certain irregularities have been committed in the administration of trade union funds they should make this known to the judicial authorities so that these authorities may examine the case and impose such penalties as may be justified under the law. It is indeed important that control over the internal acts of a trade union and the power to take measures for its suspension or dissolution should be exercised by the judicial authorities, not only to ensure the right of defence (which normal judicial procedure alone can guarantee), but also to avoid the risk of measures taken by the administrative authorities appearing to be arbitrary.
.As concerns the allegations relating to the right to strike, the Committee has constantly taken the view that such allegations are not outside its competence in so far as they concern the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee has also expressed the opinion that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. In the present case the workers concerned have not enjoyed the right to strike since the legislation deems them to belong to a public service, in which collective disputes have to be settled by compulsory arbitration and strikes are not allowed.
.While the Committee has repeatedly stated that where strikes are prohibited or subject to restrictions in undertakings or services deemed to be essential, such restriction should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation procedures', it has also taken the view that this principle might be set aside if a strike were declared illegal in one or more firms which were not performing an ""essential service"" in the strict sense of the term.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the fact that the collective dispute at the Colombian National Airline Company (AVIANCA) has been settled;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and observations set forth in paragraphs , , , , and , and in particular those to the effect that;(i) as concerns certain measures of administrative supervision of trade union finances such as special audits and investigations, they should be applied only in exceptional cases when justified by grave circumstances - for instance presumed irregularities in the annual statement or irregularities reported by members of the organisation - so as to avoid any discrimination between one trade union and another and to preclude the danger of excessive intervention by the authorities which might hamper a union's exercise of the right to organise its administration freely, and also to avoid harmful and perhaps unjustified publicity or the disclosure of information which might be confidential;(ii) as concerns the suspension of the legal personality of the trade union organisations SINTRAVA, ACMA and ACAV, such action is incompatible with the principle that workers' organisations should not be liable to be suspended by administrative authority; and(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the Government's observations on the additional information supplied by the complainants.",0,1972,Colombia
47,", the Government continues, the union members held an extraordinary meeting at which the majority passed a motion of censure against the executive of the organisation. According to the motion of censure, the leaders of the union had to resign immediately from their office and the members had to take the necessary steps for the appointment of new leaders. The Government adds that the former executive of the union, together with the staff representative, realising that it was impossible to continue working in the undertaking in view of the hostility, not only of the members of the union of wage earners of the firm, but also of the members of the salaried employees' union, chose to resign or terminate their employment relations with the undertaking.
.The Government states that the  persons affected by the measure adopted at the meeting took legal action to secure recognition of their rights. Some requested to be reinstated in their employment, considering that they had been unfairly dismissed. At the time of the Government's communication, the relevant legal proceedings were still pending. The Government concludes by saying that the firm has paid the former members of the executive and the staff representative what was due to them in accordance with the law and that it has not infringed the legislative provisions concerning trade union immunity, which they no longer enjoyed since they had been censured by a meeting of the very union they were supposed to represent.
.The Committee has taken note of the documentation sent by the Government with its communication, from which it appears that in August , one of the members of the executive of the union resigned from his employment while the remaining four were dismissed ""for reasons connected with the undertaking"". It is also apparent from these documents that the motion of censure against the union leaders was motivated by their infringement of the union rules and particularly by their political activities, it being considered ""inadmissible and in obvious breach of the union rules to take advantage, for ends and purposes of this kind, of the exclusively trade union office to which they had been elected"".
.The Committee observes that in the present case a group of  trade unionists who, at a union meeting, had voted against the government takeover of the firm for which they worked, were prevented from entering their place of work by other workers in the firm. Confronted with this situation, the government-appointed controller of the undertaking decided to dismiss  of the trade unionists and set in motion the legal procedure to secure the waiving of the provisions concerning trade union immunity from dismissal in the case of the other  ( of whom were trade union leaders). Shortly afterwards, these leaders gave up their trade union functions upon being censured by the union meeting, thereby losing the right, as trade unionists, to immunity against dismissal. Subsequently one of them resigned from his employment and the other four were dismissed ""for reasons connected with the firm"".
.From the information available, it would appear that the action taken by the government-appointed controller of the firm against the trade unionists was motivated partly by; the need to deal with a situation that had arisen when the workers refused to allow the trade unionists to enter the undertaking; it would also appear, however, that these measures were applied as a penalty for the attitude taken at a trade union meeting against the takeover ordered by the Government. In general terms, the Committee considers that a distinction should be made between, on the one hand, the responsibility of trade unionists towards their organisation in the event of its rules being infringed, and on the other hand, the actions of such trade unionists which might constitute a violation of the duties inherent in their employment relations. If a particular form of behaviour on the part of certain members or leaders within the trade union organisation did not at the same time constitute a violation of their duties as workers, the penalties that might, on such grounds, be applied to them by an employer would amount to acts of discrimination likely to undermine freedom of association in connection with employment and workers should be protected against such acts.",0,1972,Chile
48,".The complaint by the Latin American Central of Workers is contained in a communication dated  July , addressed direct to the ILO. This complaint has been supported by the world Confederation of Labour, in a communication dated  July , and by the International Federation of Trade Unions of Transport Workers, in a communication dated  September . The complainants furnished further information in a communication dated  August . The Government transmitted its observations in communications dated  July and  August .
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that Mr. Jose Vicente Mrida Mendoza, General Secretary of the Transport Workers' Union ""Alianza Capitalina"", disappeared about  June . Representatives of the Workers' National Confederation of Guatemala (CNT) are reported to have made inquiries, to no avail; however, according to information obtained by them, the person in question was allegedly kidnapped by employers in the transport industry for reasons connected with the discussion of a new collective agreement which is apparently very advantageous to the transport workers. The Government and the public authorities, despite repeated requests, have allegedly made no attempt to clear up this situation and to discover the victims' whereabouts, thus becoming accomplices in the commission of an act infringing both human and trade union rights.
.In its observations, the Government transmits information received from the Ministry of the Interior dated  August , from which it appears that the national police and especially the detective corps began the necessary investigations to find the person concerned as soon as his disappearance became known through the press. This information also indicates that, as the CNT and other bodies have stated in the press, bulletins and leaflets that the employers of a transport company were responsible for this kidnapping, the employers in question have been summoned and questioned; furthermore, searches were made of premises where it was supposed that Mr. Mrida Mendoza might have been.
.According to the same note from the Ministry of the Interior, representatives of the CNT were informed that they should make a formal accusation if they had evidence or indications of the guilt of the accused, and were also requested to co-operate with the police in providing information or data which might assist investigations. This note concludes that it has not so far been possible to discover the whereabouts of Mr. Mrida Mendoza, despite these inquiries; efforts to find him are therefore continuing, as are attempts to establish whether, as the above-mentioned organisations claim, the persons suspected are in fact guilty. In its communication dated  August  the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare has also given orders for an investigation of the facts.
.From the preceding information communicated by the Government it would appear that, contrary to the complainants' allegations, the public authorities did in fact undertake investigations but that these have not been successful. It would also seem, from this information, that the authorities have found no proof that the transport employers are responsible in this respect.
.In these circumstances, the Committee wishes to express its concern at the disappearance of the trade union leader Mrida Mendoza and recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to keep it informed on the situation and as to any results in its inquiries.",0,1972,Guatemala
49,"mentioned above had been declared illegal. The matter was before the Labour Court and as soon as the decision of the Labour Court was known it would be communicated to the ILO.
.With regard to general labour relations in Avianca, the Committee notes with interest that there has been a marked improvement in the situation. The Committee considers, however, that this situation could be further improved if the company would give serious consideration to the reinstatement, as far as possible, of the trade union leaders and the workers who were dismissed following the strike in . Indications were given by the Government that an inquiry was being made into the dismissals, but so far no information has been supplied by the Government concerning the results of this inquiry.
.As regards the situation of Alonso Cabanzo Cabanzo and Jaime Torres Reinoso, the Committee notes that their cases are now before the Labour court and that the Government will transmit the judgments of the Court as soon as these have been rendered.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above;(ii) to transmit, as soon as they have been rendered, the judgments of the Labour Court in the cases concerning Alonso Cabanzo Cabanzo and Jaime Torres Reinoso; and(iii) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the information requested in subparagraph (ii) above.
.The complaint of the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) is contained in two communications dated  and  August . The complaint of the National Union of Workers of Avianca (SINTRAVA), the Colombian Association of Aircraft Mechanics (ALMA) and the Association of Flight Auxiliaries (ACAV) is contained in a communication dated  August . By a communication dated  September , the ITF requested that its complaint and that of the aforementioned Colombian organisations should be regarded as one single complaint. The ITF and the SINTRAVA supplied additional information by two communications dated  and  April  respectively.
.To date, the Government has forwarded its observations only on the original complaints from the four organisations, by a communication dated  February .
.Colombia has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise convention,  (No. ), or the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state that on  June  the organisations SINTRAVA, ACMA and ACAV submitted a set of claims to the Colombian National Airline Company (AVIANCA), which responded with a set of counter-claims proposing the abolition of various benefits acquired under previous collective agreements and the approval of a set of internal rules detrimental to the workers. AVIANCA is alleged to have followed a policy of trade union repression consisting in the dismissal of union leaders and other workers and to have remained intransigent during the collective bargaining until it broke off the talks after thirteen meetings without agreeing to any of the workers' claims. In view of this attitude the workers decided not to work overtime until such time as AVIANCA changed its attitude and was willing to negotiate in good faith.
.The complainants continue by stating that the AVIANCA then accused the workers of sabotage, as a result of which the Minister of Labour, without investigating the matter, suspended the legal personality of the three organisations and ordered that their funds be frozen. At the same time the police invaded the airports, as a result of which the personnel stopped work and later withdrew from the work centres. The Company, for its part, cancelled certain transport services. On  August  the Minister of Labour declared the partial stoppage of work to be illegal and authorised AVIANCA to dismiss trade union leaders and workers. The total number of workers dismissed was , in addition to all the leaders of the three organisations. The complainants conclude by asserting that AVIANCA and the Ministry of Labour are trying to negotiate with certain workers whom they trust absolutely and who were expelled from SINTRAVA for mishandling trade union funds and working in league with the employers; that the police prevent the workers from holding meetings; that AVIANCA has put every form of moral and material pressure on the workers, and that under Colombian law employers are not authorised to submit claims to the workers.
.In its reply the Government states that after the denunciation of the collective agreement then in force by both SINTRAVA and AVIANCA negotiations were started but no positive results were achieved. No settlement having been reached, the three trade union organisations launched the so-called ""tortoise plan which involved the daily obstruction of the rendering of a public service - i.e. transport, the distribution of air mail, etc. - regardless of the fact that the National Constitution prohibits strikes in public services and section  of the Labour Code explicitly prohibits strikes in land, water and air transport. The ""tortoise plan"" consisted in doing less work at a slower speed, intentionally slowing down the pace of work. Section  of the Labour Code forbids workers to slow down the rate of work intentionally, to interrupt work, to promote untimely stoppages of work or to incite others to declare or maintain such stoppages, while section  declares insufficient work output to be a lawful ground for dismissing a worker or terminating his contract of employment.
.The Government continues by stating that the Ministry of Labour intervened to try to convince the trade union leaders that the workers were under an obligation to discharge their duties so that negotiations on their claims could proceed. Although the unions maintained that it was not ""tortoise plan"", but that the workers had simply refused to work overtime, on  August  the representatives of the three organisations called on the employees of AVIANCA to help to restore the Company's operations to normal. The undertaking even announced that certain serious acts had been committed which had endangered the lives of passengers and crew members.
.At the same time, declares the Government, the Chief of the Trade Union Auditing Section of the Ministry of Labour made a request to the Secretary-General of the Ministry for the suspension of the legal personality of the three organisations on the ground that evidence of improper handling of union funds had been found during inspections carried out in these organisations. According to the information supplied by the Government irregularities had been brought to light in respect of various financial operations. In the case of one of the organisations, the last accounts submitted to the Ministry covered the period up to June , whereas the law requires the submission of accounts at six-monthly intervals. In the light of these facts the Minister suspended the legal personality of the three unions on  August .
.On  August  the workers came out on strike. The strike was declared unlawful by the Ministry of Labour, with the result that the Company was free to dismiss workers who persisted with the stoppage, and the special immunity from dismissal enjoyed by trade union officials ceased to be operative. Since the strike had been declared by the three trade unions, the suspension of their legal personality was ratified in accordance with section  of the Labour Code.
.The Government goes on to state that on  August  the presidents of the three unions requested the Minister of Labour to revoke the suspension of legal personality, offering to place at the Ministry's disposal all their ledgers and documents and acquiescing in the continued freezing of the unions' funds while these were being inspected, so that ""the authorities will be certain of complete control of them"". On the same day the suspension of legal personality was revoked, and after various approaches to the parties by the labour authorities the conciliation stage in the negotiations on the workers' claims was initiated, and was pursued until  September . No settlement having been reached, the Ministry then set up an arbitration board in accordance with the terms of Act No.  of , which lays down that collective disputes in public services are to be submitted to compulsory arbitration if no solution has been found at the direct settlement or conciliation stage. The arbitration award was published on  December , and at the request of the parties the board issued a statement clarifying certain clauses in the award on  February .
.The Government concludes by stating, inter alia, that AVIANCA is not a state-owned undertaking but a privately owned limited liability joint stock company, that it was never the intention of the Government to eliminate the unions concerned but that it had to take certain steps because the unions had broken the law, and that it was not a question of restricting the right to strike but of regulating it so as to prevent a public service from being adversely affected.
.The Committee observes that from the information at its disposal there",0,1972,Colombia
50,".This case was last examined by the Committee at its session in November , when it submitted to the Governing Body interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It will be recalled that, according to the complainants, the Colombian National Airline Company (AVIANCA) had dismissed a number of trade union leaders for participating in a strike on  August . The complainants also stated that a large number of workers had been dismissed for the same reason. The Government stated that the tension which existed between the unions and the AVIANCA undertaking had eased and that labour relations had become harmonious. In the light of this information, the Committee requested the Director-General, in May , to ask the complainants for their observations regarding the statement made by the Government.
.The International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) had replied that the leaders of the Colombian Association of Aircraft Mechanics (ACMA) and the Association of Flight Auxiliaries (ACAV) had still not been reinstated in the jobs they had held before their dismissal. In particular, ITF mentioned the case of Alonso Cabanzo Cabanzo, former president of the ACAV, and Jaime Torres Reinoso, former general secretary of that union. ITF added that the Minister of Labour had not yet intervened to bring about any results despite promises to do so. The two aforementioned persons had worked with the company for many years; they had never belonged to any political movement and had never given AVIANCA cause to complain about their work. According to ITF, the clear implication was that their dismissal had arisen solely as a result of their trade union activities. The complainants added, however, that they were glad to concede that there had been a marked improvement in the industrial relations situation within the company, which made it all the more regrettable that the question of reinstatement had not yet been resolved.
.In a later communication, the Government stated that Alonso Cabanzo Cabanzo and Jaime Torres Reinoso had been dismissed in accordance with a resolution issued by the Minister of Labour whereby the strike mentioned above had been declared illegal. The matter was before the Labour Court.
.In its rd Report the Committee noted with interest that there had been a marked improvement in industrial relations at the AVIANCA company. It considered, however, that this situation could be further improved if the company would give serious consideration to the reinstatement, as far as possible, of the trade union leaders and the dismissed workers. It recommended the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to these considerations and to request the Government to transmit, as soon as they had been rendered, the judgements of the Labour Court in the cases concerning Messrs. Alonso Cabanzo Cabanzo and Jaime Torres Reinoso.
.In communications of  March and  July  the Government indicated that the proceedings which had been instituted were still before the Court. It further stated, in a letter of  April , that on  March  the Labour Court had ordered AVIANCA to reinstate Jaime Torres Reinoso and to pay him compensation amounting to  pesos and  centimos a day from  August  up to the date of his reinstatement. The Government communicated the text of the sentence and stated that, in accordance with the law, the competent ministry had merely declared the strike illegal: whether or not they enjoyed immunity (fuero) on account of their trade union activities, the workers could be dismissed only by authorisation. Since this authorisation had not been given, the labour judge had passed the aforementioned sentence on the undertaking. The case of Mr. Alonso Cabanzo Cabanzo was still pending, continued the Government, but it was hoped that the judgement would be rendered within the next few days. The Ministry of Labour did not intervene in judicial decisions, but attempted to prevent employers dismissing workers without authorisation, as in the present case. The appeal of Mr. Alonso Cabanzo Cabanzo was based on the same argument as that of Mr. Jaime Torres Reinoso and it was therefore likely that he would be reinstated.
.The Committee notes this information with interest. Since, however, the dismissals took place in August , it wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the judgement by which Mr. Jaime Torres Reinoso was reinstated in his employment;(b) to request the Government to keep it informed of the results of the judicial proceedings concerning Mr. Alonso Cabanzo Cabanzo.
.This case was last examined by the Committee at its session in May  when it submitted to the Governing Body an interim report (contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in June ).
.The Committee recalls that, when it last examined the case, it had reached certain conclusions on the basis of the original complaints submitted by the four complainant organisations, but that it had not at that time received the observations of the Government on additional information supplied by the International Transport Workers' Federation (ITF) and the National Union of Workers of Avianca (SINTRAVA) in two communications dated  and  April .
.Colombia has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The additional information supplied by the complainants referred to above, on which the Government had not submitted any observations, concerned the alleged failure of the management of the Colombian National Airline Company (AVIANCA) to reinstate  trade union leaders who had been dismissed on account of their participation in the strike which had taken place on  August . A list of a further  workers, dismissed for the same reason, had also been supplied by the complainants who stated that in order to find other employment these workers required a reference from Avianca and the references that were provided stated that the workers concerned had participated in the strike in . The effect of this, the complainants added, was to make it impossible for the workers to find other employment.
.In a communication dated  June  the Government indicated that the National Labour Inspectorate was carrying out an inquiry into the alleged collective dismissals by Avianca but that since Avianca employed , workers throughout the country there would be some delay in carrying out the investigations. In a further communication, dated  February , the Government stated that the tension which existed between the unions and the Avianca undertaking had eased and that labour relations in it were at that time harmonious. The Government added that because of a new agreement which had been signed on  November  the workers who frequently came to the offices of the labour inspectorate of the Ministry of Labour found no reason to return despite invitations to do so.
.In view of this latter information the Committee decided, at its session in May , to adjourn its examination of the case and to request the Director-General to ask the complainant organisations for their observations regarding the statements made by the Government in its latest communication.
.In two communications, dated  April  and  June , the International Transport Workers' Federation stated that leaders of the Colombian Association of Aircraft Mechanics (ACMA), and of the Association of Flight Auxiliaries (ACAV), and, in particular, Alonso Cabanzo Cabanzo, former President of the ACAV, and Jaime Torres Reinoso, former General Secretary of that union, had still not been reinstated in the positions they held with the Avianca Airlines before their dismissal and that the Minister of Labour had not yet intervened to bring about any results despite promises to do so. The ITF stated that these persons had worked  and  years respectively for Avianca, that neither had even belonged to any political movement and had never given Avianca cause to complain about the way they carried out their duties in the company. The clear implication, asserted the ITF was that their dismissal and the failure to reinstate them had arisen purely from their trade union activities. The ITF added, however, that it was glad to concede that there had been a marked improvement in the industrial situation within the company, which made it all the more a pity that the question of reinstatement had not been resolved.

.The complaint was contained in a communication dated  September , supplemented by a communication dated  October . This complaint was supported by the World Confederation of Labour in a communication dated  November .
.These communications were transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations and additional information by letters dated  January  and  January .
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  September  detachments from the Medellin Section of the Department of Security, carrying out the orders of the military authorities, forced their way into the premises of the Antioquia Teachers' Association (ADIDA) and arrested and handed over to the said authorities the following persons: Victor Baena Lpez, President of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) (affiliated to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT)); Oscar Oquendo, President of ADIDA (affiliated to the CGT); Rafael Seplveda, Vice-President of the ADIDA; Humberto Vanegas and Helena Cadavid, members of the executive of the ADIDA; and Nelly Angel, Secretary of the ADIDA. The complainants added that following a sympathy campaign these persons had been conditionally released on  September, but that since then Helena Cadavid had been rearrested and placed in solitary confinement by the authorities of Medellin. The complainants further alleged that Dr. Augusto Villegas Duque, principal legal adviser of the Legal Department of the CGT, had been arrested and placed in solitary confinement by the military authorities of Bogot.
.The complainants state that the police, armed with revolvers and sub-machineguns, had burst into the premises of the ADIDA, using force and without a warrant, and seized trade union material, a mimeograph, correspondence and other documents and carried them away together with other working materials after upsetting everything and doing considerable damage.
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that the trade union leaders mentioned in the complaint had been arrested for having taken part in disorderly conduct. It points out that they have all been released.
.Following the Committee's decision at its February  session to ask the Director-General to request certain additional information, a letter was addressed to the Government on  March  requesting it: (a) to indicate whether proceedings were still pending against the persons mentioned in the complaint and now at liberty and, if so, to specify the nature of the ""disorderly conduct"" which, in the eyes of the Government, had justified their arrest; (b) to indicate the procedure followed on the occasion of the alleged police raid on the premises of the ADIDA, stating in particular whether the raid had been pursuant to the delivery of a search warrant by the competent judicial authority; (c) to provide its observations on the allegation to the effect that Dr. Augusto Villegas Duque, principal legal adviser of the Legal Department of the CGT, had been arrested and placed in solitary confinement by the military authorities of Bogot.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that there are no proceedings pending against the persons mentioned in the complaint, who are now at liberty. As concerns the police raid on the premises of the ADIDA, the Government indicates that a state of siege had been proclaimed throughout the country under article  of the Colombian Constitution. In such circumstances the military authorities are empowered to carry out a search of any premises without a warrant in connection with acts directed against public order, and this is what happened in the case under consideration. The Government concludes by stating that Dr. Augusto Villegas Duque is now at liberty and no proceedings are pending against him.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the arrest of trade union officials and of Dr. Augusto Villegas Duque, the Committee notes that the persons mentioned in the complaint are now at liberty and no proceedings are pending against them. The Committee regrets, however, that the Government has not provided any explanation concerning the ""disorderly conduct"" on the basis of which they were arrested, thereby making it impossible for the Committee to come to its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts.
.The Committee considers it relevant to recall the opinion it has expressed on a number of occasions to the effect that the detention by authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights, and that in such cases it is important that governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have appropriate instructions to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the police raid on the premises of the ADIDA, and in particular the allegations referring to the seizure by the policy of documents and working materials and the damage said to have been caused on this occasion, the Committee feels bound to draw the Government's attention to the fact that the International Labour Conference, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th Session (Geneva, ), has expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations constitutes one of the civil liberties which are essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Government Body:(a) to note the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the persons mentioned are now at liberty and no proceedings are pending against them;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above; and(c) subject to this reservation, to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",0,1972,Colombia

This Act has been continuously in force, with the exception of a few periods in recent years when it was suspended by the Government. The complainants state that fresh negotiations were to be held to revise the collective agreements reached in , and that the revised agreements would have come into force on  April . Before the expiry of the old agreements, however, the Government promulgated Act No.  whereby the collective agreements in force were extended until  October  and absurdly low percentages fixed for wage increases. By this action, the complainants maintain, the Government infringed not only a Constitutional guarantee but also Convention No. . The General Confederation of Labour appealed to the President to have the wage measures repealed, but to no avail.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the Constitutional provision to which the complainants refer does not prevent the State from postponing collective bargaining when the economic situation makes such action advisable, or from promulgating legislation ensuring decent conditions of work and fair wages for the workers in accordance with the terms of the Constitution itself. Act No.  has neither abolished nor suspended the system of collective agreements but has merely extended the agreements already in force. In so doing, the Government has taken account of an exceptional economic and political situation and its aim is to check the inflation that is reducing the purchasing power of the population. The President has stated that the Government's fundamental objectives are the maintenance of real wages, a high rate of investment in public works, the prevention of recession, the slowing down of the rate of inflation by means other than purely monetary measures, the reorganisation of public finance on a sound footing, increased domestic savings and the rational use of foreign savings.
.The Government concludes by saying that to enable workers to keep up with the rising cost of living, the above-mentioned Act (No. ) has also established percentages for wage increase for the periods  January to  June  and  July to  December . As part of a coherent wage policy, a reasonable increase has also been made in the minimum living wage.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that on  April  the President announced important economic and social measures. The decisions taken included one concerning the convening, during the second half of the current year, of the joint committees provided for in Act No.  "" to draw up the new collective agreements that will come into force on  January  "". The Government adds that this is proof of the firm intention of the authorities to comply with Convention No. .
.The Committee recalls that it has already stated in the past, in two cases concerning Argentina, that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.)
.The Committee has also referred in the past to certain procedures designed to ensure that the parties to collective bargaining have regard voluntarily in their negotiations to considerations relating to the economic or social policy of the government and the safeguarding of the national interest. In this respect the Committee has pointed out that it was necessary first of all that the objectives to be recognised as being in the general interest should have been widely discussed by all parties on a national scale through a body such as a national social policy advisory board, in accordance with the principle laid down by the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ). It might also be possible to envisage a procedure whereby the attention of the parties could be drawn, in certain cases, to the considerations of general interest which might call for further examination of the terms of agreement on their part. If the public authority considered that the terms of the proposed agreements were manifestly in conflict with the economic policy objectives recognised as being desirable in the general interest, the cases could be submitted for advice and recommendation to an appropriate consultative body, it being understood, however, that the final decision in the matter rested with the parties to the agreement.,",0,1972,Argentina

.The complainants allege that in order to prevent workers from exercising their trade union rights the Government has arbitrarily withdrawn the legal personality of the General Confederation of Labour of Argentina and has blocked the trade union funds.

As regards the withdrawal of the legal personality of the Argentinian General Confederation of Labour, the Government declares that this measure was annulled by Resolution MT No.  dated  July .
.Although neither the complainants nor the Government give the exact reasons for which the General Confederation of Labour became the object of the measures mentioned in the complaint, the Committee feels that it should point out that, even if measures of this kind may in certain circumstances be justified, they should, in order to avoid any danger of arbitrary action, be taken through judicial and not administrative action, as seems to have been done in the present case.

.The complainants state that, by imprisoning this union leader, the Government violated the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and  and trampled underfoot the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
.In its observations, the Government affirms that Mr. Felipe Burgos has never at any time been arrested on account of his trade union activities, since the representatives of the country's occupational associations of workers enjoy total freedom to perform their trade union functions within the framework of the National Constitution.
.The Government goes on to say that the reason for Mr. Burgos's arrest was his connection with a subversive group which had attempted to take over the locality of Ampacaschi, in the province of Salta. It was for this reason that Mr. Burgos was summoned to appear before the Federal Criminal Court, since the acts he was suspected of committing constituted a criminal offence upon which this court was competent to sit in judgement.
.The Government adds that the court in question ordered the release of Mr. Burgos on  October .
.On the basis of the evidence before it, the Committee considers that proof has not been established that the action taken against Mr. Felipe Burgos had any connection with his trade union activities.

In this connection, the ITAC states that on  October  it addressed a letter to the Prime Minister requesting an audience with him in order to outline the unfair labour practices which, it stated, its affiliates had been experiencing over some months. In an appendix to the aforesaid letter the complainants set out in chronological order the chain of events which they claimed had been experienced by their affiliates. The complainants also drew the Prime Minister's attention to a  week strike which had been in progress at Kelly's Group of Companies, in which, they state, the Prime Minister's intervention had been earlier requested; they added that the matter had not yet been resolved. In the aforesaid letter the complainants further requested the Prime Minister to amend the Direction of the Ministry of Labour in taking of Representation Poll which, the complainants stated, could be used by politicians and civil servants to destroy any trade union.

."" April  the Secretary of the JIDC acknowledged receipt of the claim and stated: It is our policy to deal with any labour union which has been chosen by the majority of the workers to represent them.

58,"allowed to negotiate through the Onion of their choice. Provided that, in accordance with the Government's instructions, the Labour Adviser shall have no dealings with any union associated with communism or under communist influence.-""
.In a further communication dated  November  the ITAC stated that the Ministry of Labour was still reluctant to hold a representational poll in the case of Sinclair's garage and the workers, who were members of the Jamaica Congress of Labour. The ITAC submits copies of a further request to the Ministry dated  August  to conduct such a poll, as well as copies of an appeal made to ministers, Members of Parliament and international bodies soliciting their support.
.The World Confederation of Labour, in its communication dated  November , stated that discriminatory and undemocratic practices had taken place against trade unions.
.The Government, in its communication dated  January , refutes the allegations of the ITAC and states that it would appear that they were influenced by political malice. The Government points out that it not only supports the principles of freedom of association and the right of workers to bargain collectively, but encourages, on a voluntary basis, autonomy in industry, and to this end the Ministry of Labour and Employment provides machinery for the determination of representational issues arising out of claims by trade unions.
.The Government explains that this machinery provides that, by agreement of the parties, the Ministry may take a poll by secret ballot to determine the wishes of the workers concerned where such a poll is conducted, continues the Government, the agreement usually provides for a determination of the bargaining position based upon the outcome of the poll. A fact-finding poll may be taken by the Ministry to determine the extent of the membership of the union in the particular establishment. The Government adds that in no case can a poll of any kind be conducted by the Ministry without the co-operation of the employer who must provide a list of names of the workers involved in order to permit the Ministry to enter and conduct such a poll on its premises during working hours. The Government attaches to its communication a copy of the ""Directions by the Ministry of Labour on the taking of polls in representational disputes between trade unions"". The Government states that the principle of allowing workers to negotiate through the union of their choice is clearly expressed in this document. The National Constitution, adds the Government, also specifically guarantees to workers the right to belong to the trade union of their choice.
.In addition, the Government supplies background information in respect of the five cases referred to by the ITAC. It is to be observed, states the Government, that in all five cases the Ministry of Labour and Employment had taken the necessary measures in accordance with the recognised and accepted practice to have the claims determined and settled, but despite the Ministry's endeavours, the companies concerned have refused to co-operate.
.The Government explains that where representational disputes are not settled to the satisfaction of either party, it is customary for the aggrieved party to take such action as it wishes within the law to oblige the other party to recognise it. In the majority of the cases the claimant unions have taken strike action, and with the exception of the Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation, the other companies have bluntly refused to recognise the unions or to participate in the taking of a poll. The Government adds that while it strongly supports the principle of trade union recognition in a free enterprise society, as is the case in Jamaica, it is unable to compel employers to recognise any particular union. The Government points out that it is significant that the Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation, which has recognised the union concerned, is a statutory body set up by the Government.
.The Committee notes that the complaints concern attempts by the Jamaica Congress of Labour and, in one case, the Electrical and Construction Workers' Union (both affiliates of the independent Trade Unions Advisory Council) to obtain recognition by the companies mentioned in the complaint as sole bargaining agents on the grounds that they represent the majority of the workers in the respective enterprises.
.The Committee notes that there exists in Jamaica a procedure for the taking of a poll in the event of representational disputes between unions. This procedure is laid down in the ""Directions by the Minister of Labour"", a copy of which has been supplied by the Government. In terms of these directions the Labour Adviser may take a poll when he is satisfied that a considerable proportion of the workers concerned wish it, but subject to the following conditions: (a) if there is agreement between all the parties to the dispute; (b) if the employer and one or more of the unions concerned agree to the poll; and (c) where two or more unions agree to the taking of a poll. Section  of these Directions provides that, where consent as required in (a), (b) and (c) above cannot be obtained the Labour Adviser may, if he is satisfied that a prima facie case is made out by the claimant union, take the poll, subject to a deposit being made by the claimant union.
.The Committee recalls that it has, on previous occasions, examined cases concerning Jamaica involving complaints of non-recognition of unions claiming to be representative of the workers. According to the information at the disposal of the Committee, it appears that where a poll is conducted on the basis of an agreement between the parties, that agreement usually provides for a determination of the bargaining position based upon the outcome of the poll. A fact-finding poll, not being based upon an agreement, merely determines the wishes of the workers in respect of the claimant union. But, as the Government explains, in any event, no poll of any kind can be conducted by the Ministry without the cooperation of the employer who must provide a list of the names of the workers involved, and permit the Ministry to enter and conduct such a poll on its premises during working hours.
.In the case of the Jamaica Industrial Development Corporation, the Committee notes that following a claim for recognition submitted by the Jamaica Congress of Labour and meetings between the parties, sole negotiating rights were conceded to the Jamaica Congress of Labour. In the case of the four remaining undertakings, the Committee notes that although claims for recognition have been lodged with the Ministry of Labour and Employment by the unions concerned, along with supporting evidence of membership, no representation polls have yet been taken. In at least two of these cases (viz. Kelly's Group of Companies, and Jamaica Laminates, etc. (now Building Components Ltd.)), the Committee notes from the information supplied by the Government that the union concerned (in each case the Jamaica Congress of Labour) has made out a prima facie case for a representation poll to be taken. According to the information at the disposal of the Committee it would seem that the managements of the various undertakings involved have refused to co-operate in the representation poll procedure either by failing or delaying to communicate necessary information to the Ministry, or by failing to attend meetings called by the Ministry to discuss the question of recognition.
.While any lack of co-operation by employers in an established procedure for determining the most representative union would be regrettable, nevertheless the Committee is bound to observe, as it has already done in previous cases, that nothing in Article  of Convention No.  places a duty on the Government to enforce collective bargaining by compulsory means with a given organisation, and a refusal by an employer to bargain with a particular union cannot be regarded as an infringement of freedom of association.
.Nevertheless, in previous cases where the recognition of a trade union for collective bargaining purposes has been in question, the Committee has emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle that employers, including governmental authorities in the capacity of employers of wage earners, should recognise for collective bargaining purposes the organisations representative of the wage earners employed by them. The Committee has also taken the view that, if there is a change in the relative strength of unions competing for a preferential right or the power to represent workers exclusively for collective bargaining purposes, then it is desirable that there should be the possibility of a review of the factual bases on which that right or power was granted. In the absence of such a possibility, a majority of the workers concerned might be represented by a union which, for an unduly long period, could be prevented - either in fact or in law - from organising its administration and activities with a view to fully furthering and defending the interests of its members.
.Having regard to the principles expressed in paragraph  above, the Committee considers that the competent authorities should, in all cases, have the power to proceed to",1,1972,Jamaica

Subsequently, according to the complainants, Mr. Beltrn was imprisoned on board an "" old cattle boat (viejo barco ganadero) and placed in inhuman conditions in the dismantled hull of this ship, which had not been used for a long time "".
.In its comments, the Government states that Mr. Beltrn was arrested and charged by order of a Federal Criminal Court for breach of section  of the Criminal Code in that he carried out an armed attack against an Argentine naval post at Zrate (Buenos Aires Province) on  January .
.The Government adds that the accused was first imprisoned in the Northern State Prison. As regards the "" old cattle boat "" (viejo barco ganadero), the Government explains that it is in fact a prison ship called the "" Granadero "", which according to a recent report by the Minister of Justice (quoted by the Government in its reply) complies with the relevant health standards.
.The Government goes on to state that the accused was provisionally released on  June  (a fact confirmed by the World Confederation of Labour in its communication dated  August ) and that, on  July, he was granted a partial, provisional stay of proceedings.
.According to the information supplied by the Government, it would appear that Mr. Beltrn was charged before a regular court and that the grounds for the proceedings against him were unconnected with his trade union office or activities. For their part, the complainants did not specifically allege that his arrest was due to his trade union membership or activities.
.Accordingly, the Committee considers that it has not been proved that there was any connection between the proceedings taken against Mr. Beltrn and the free exercise of his trade union rights, and recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination on its part.",0,1972,Argentina

.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). It has, however, ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WFTU alleged that the National Confederation of Credit Employees (CONTEC), an organisation with , members (bank and insurance employees), had its Executive Committee appointed direct by the Ministry of Labour after the latter had vetoed the Committee elected democratically by the members of CONTEC.
.The WFTU encloses with its communication an article from the magazine Folha Bancaria (dated November-December ) dealing with the matter. The article states that a Decree dated  October  replaced the Executive Committee of CONTEC by a Supervisory Committee (Junta interventora), substituting a representative of the Ministry of Labour for one of its members. Two bank employees were accepted by the Ministry to make up a three-man supervisory board but these employees resigned from the board, thus leaving the Confederation entirely in the hands of the third member, an official of the Ministry of Labour and Social welfare.
.The article adds that elections for a new Executive Committee were to be held on  October  but that the Ministry of Labour vetoed the candidature of ten persons, whose names were on the proposed single list, thus preventing the elections from taking place. In particular the veto concerned the economist, Ruy de Brito, who had been the CONTEC leader for some years. Nevertheless the Department of Security and Information of the Ministry of Labour informed several trade union leaders that this veto did not mean that Ruy de Brito was considered to be ""a Communist or corrupt"". According to the newspaper Estato de Sao Paulo, the opinions of Ruy de Brito on the subject of the Government's wages policy, the Length of Service Guarantee Fund, the Social Integration Plan and his own central trade union organisation were enough to prevent his candidature from being accepted.
.Quoting another newspaper, the periodical Folha Bancaria states that Ruy de Brito had fallen out of favour with the Ministry of Labour. According to various sources and in particular to Ruy de Brito himself, this was because of the opinions he had expressed on various social issues. In particular he had protested against the interference of the Ministry of Labour in the affairs of the bank employees' union of Guanabara.
.The Government, in its communication, states that the complaint is unjustified under Brazilian domestic law. The Government specifies that, under section  of the consolidation of Labour Laws, trade unions are not authorised to exercise political activities. However, the Government adds, the CONTEC executive carried on political activities completely contrary to the law by spreading doctrines incompatible with the national institutions. Moreover, activist groups belonging to a party that is not recognised by law are said to have met at the union's headquarters. Consequently, the Ministry was obliged to inform the CONTEC executive that it did not meet the legal requirements for re-election.
.The Government adds that since the union was unable to agree on the new candidates to be presented for election, a provisional administration had to be organised. To make up this interim body, the union proposed two bank employees and the Ministry of Labour an accountant. The civil servant, the Government points out, was therefore in the minority, but since the employees resigned, the Ministry of Labour had to appoint substitutes while awaiting the next elections.
.Lastly, the Government states that the present executive of the union is of a purely temporary nature, that it is merely carrying out routine functions until new elections are held and that it is the consequence of a crisis caused by the former administration.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the political activities of the executive of CONTEC are the cause of the measures taken against it. The Committee thinks it appropriate to recall the opinion it has expressed that if trade unions are prohibited in general terms from engaging in any political activities this may raise difficulties by reason of the fact that the interpretation given to such provisions in practice may change at any moment and considerably restrict the possibility of action of the organisations. It would therefore seem that States should be able, without prohibiting in general terms political activities by occupational organisations, to entrust to the judicial authorities the task of repressing abuses which might, in certain cases, be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be the economic and social advancement of their members.
.Moreover, in a number of cases, the Committee has stated that the principles of freedom of association do not prohibit control of the internal activities of a trade union when the latter infringes the law (which should not, however, be such as to undermine the principles of freedom of association), but it has considered it to be of maximum importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, the control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority.
.As regards the measures taken against the executive of CONTEC, the Committee notes that for more than  months the Confederation has been managed by a body appointed by the Ministry of Labour and that apparently it has not been possible to organise elections because this Ministry has vetoed certain candidates.
.The Committee wishes to recall in this connection that in previous cases concerning Brazil, it has considered that the placing of trade union organisations under control entailed a serious danger of restricting the rights of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.The Committee has also pointed out that the removal from office of trade union leaders in cases where infringements of the law or of the internal rules have been proved as well as the appointment of temporary administrators, should be effected through the courts. The Committee has also considered that, for the taking over of a union by the authorities to be admissible, it must be temporary and designed solely to allow free elections to be organised.
.The Committee has, moreover, always emphasised the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs , , ,  and  above and in particular to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to invite the Government to take the necessary measures for free elections to be held as soon as possible in order to appoint a new executive of CONTEC;(c) to invite the Government, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee, to inform it, before the Committee's session in November , of the measures taken to allow free elections to be held.",0,1973,Brazil
61,".The complaint of the Independent Trade Unions Action Council (ITAC), the Jamaica Congress of Labour, the Dockers' and Marine workers' Union, the University and Allied Workers' Union, the Municipal and Parish Council Workers' Union, the Jamaica Union of Public Officers and Public Employees, the Port Supervisory Union, and the Union of Technical Administrative and Supervisory Personnel is contained in a communication dated  December . The ITAC sent further information on  March . The complaint was forwarded to the Government, which sent replies on  February and  May .
.Jamaica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the communication of  December , the complainants allege that the Government of Jamaica has drawn up two Bills, the Industrial Relations Bill and the Public Service Relations Bill, without giving enough time to the independent unions not represented on the Labour Advisory Council to formulate their comments and study the drafts.
.The complainants object in particular to certain provisions of these Bills which introduce fines and possible imprisonment for refusal to obey certain ministerial orders in labour matters, the wide discretion given to the Minister of Labour to qualify any activity as an ""essential service"" and hence prohibit strikes or other industrial action in that sector, the exclusion of the Government (though the largest employer in the country) from the obligation of submitting labour disputes with their employees to an arbitration tribunal, and the discretion given to the Minister in ordering the taking of polls for the determination of the majority union in an undertaking.
.In its letter of  March , the ITAC encloses a copy of the modified Bill, entitled ""Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Bill, "". The Committee notes from this text and from a copy of a letter from the Prime Minister to the General Secretary of the ITAC, enclosed by the complainant in its communication, that certain of the original provisions concerning imprisonment for disobedience to ministerial orders have disappeared and, although provisions for fines remain they will be treated, according to the Prime Minister's letter, as judgement debts due to the Crown and thus would not entail imprisonment for non-payment.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that it supports the principle of freedom of association and the right of workers to bargain collectively but that, while it accepts that freedom in collective bargaining is an ideal method for the adjustment of trade disputes, it feels that in view of the cur rent pattern and frequency of industrial disputes, the stage has been reached for the setting up of procedures for assisting in the containment of those disputes which, if unresolved, could well jeopardise its national efforts. It therefore intends to introduce legislation designed to provide for the development and maintenance of more orderly industrial relations and more effective machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes.
.The Government adds that the first drafts of the proposed legislation were discussed in the Labour Advisory Council (in which employers' and workers' organisations are equally represented) and that drafts were also circulated to the organisations not represented on that Council, and in particular to the complainants in the present case. The Government transmits the text of the Bill which was tabled in Parliament on  February  and states that the Bill has since been referred to a Select Committee of the House for consideration and that the comments of the public have been invited and will be studied in that Committee. The Government declares itself willing to make amendments to the Bill if they should be considered necessary.
.According to section  of the Bill, any ""industrial action"" (which is defined as including lockouts, strikes and any course of conduct which is carried on with the intent of preventing, reducing or otherwise adversely affecting the production of goods or the provision of services) in essential services is prohibited unless the Minister or the Industrial Disputes Tribunal has not complied with the provisions requiring them to take certain action within relatively brief time limits. Machinery is provided whereby the parties can choose their own method for the settlement of disputes but, should this fail, the dispute shall be referred to a tripartite Industrial Disputes Tribunal.
.The Committee has always stated in the past that whenever strikes are prohibited in essential services or the civil service this restriction should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which awards are binding in all cases on both parties. In this case, the provision made for tripartite arbitration machinery, which is of wider application in the field of labour disputes, or other procedures agreed upon by the parties and in which the parties to the dispute are equally represented would seem to satisfy the criteria which have guided the Committee in its past considerations, provided, however, that in the case of disputes in an essential service in which the Government or municipal authorities are the employer, the award of this Tribunal is binding upon the Government or municipality. The Bill is not entirely clear on this point.
.The Bill provides that the following services shall be considered essential: water, electricity, health, hospital, sanitary, public passenger transport, fire-fighting and prison services, and all services connected with the storage and delivery of goods at, or from, docks, wharves and warehouses operated in connection with docks or wharves. In his statement made upon the presentation of this Bill to Parliament (a copy of which was forwarded by the Government), the Minister of Labour and Employment stated that public passenger transport had been included because of the need to transport workers to their jobs, particularly those employed in other essential services and the necessity to curtail the activities of illegal drivers whose passengers are not protected by insurance and whose vehicles may not have been given the necessary road safety certificates. According to section  of the Bill, however, the Minister of Labour may at any time amend the list of essential services subject to an affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. Further, the Minister may order compulsory arbitration (and in consequence cessation of industrial action) in relation to any industrial dispute, even if not in an ""essential service"", if it appears to him that it has caused or would cause an interruption in the supply of goods or in the provisions of services of such a nature or on such a scale as to be likely to be gravely injurious to the national interest. The Minister explained to the House, in his statement referred to above, that the Government felt that the time had come when the Minister, representing the public in general, must be vested with authority under the law to secure resumption of the flow of goods and services while procedures are set in motion to effect a settlement. The Minister added that this power would not be lightly used, but only in cases where the national interest is gravely endangered.
.The Committee notes that many of the services at present listed in the Bill appear to correspond with those normally considered essential in the strict sense. It recall:, however, that with regard to legislation which leaves a government a good deal of latitude in deciding which activities are to be considered public services and which in certain cases might not coincide with those that come under the heading of ""essential services"", it has taken the view that its principle regarding the prohibition of strikes in the essential services, referred to in paragraph  above, might be set aside if a strike were declared illegal in one or more firms which were not performing an ""essential service"" in the strict sense of the term.
.With regard to the procedure for determining the most representative union and its recognition by the employers for the purposes of collective bargaining, the Committee recalls that in relation to Case No.  concerning Jamaica, on which the Committee submitted conclusions to the Governing Body in its th Report, it considered in particular that the competent authorities should, in all cases, have the power to proceed to an objective verification of any claim by a union that it represents the majority of the workers in an undertaking, provided such a claim appeared plausible. The Committee recommended that the Government should be requested to indicate what steps if any had been taken or were being considered to establish a procedure such as that suggested by the Committee. At paragraph  of its nd Report, the Committee noted that the Government had reported that it proposed in January  to put before Parliament a Bill which would provide inter alia for compulsory poll-taking to determine trade union claims for recognition and the compulsory recognition of unions in cases where the union had established that it represented a specific proportion of the labour force.
.Section  of the Labour",1,1973,Jamaica
62,"Relations and Industrial Disputes Bill  provides that the Minister may, at the request of the employer or of any trade union claiming bargaining rights in relation to a group of workers in the proposed unit, cause a ballot to be taken for the purpose of determining which unions are most representative and that, if the ballot shows that a majority of workers indicate that they wish a particular union to represent them, the employer is obliged to recognise that union as bargaining agent, and is subject to stringent penalties if he refuses recognition. Although from the language of section  it would appear that the Minister has discretion as to whether to order such a poll or not, the Minister, in his statement before Parliament referred to in paragraph  above, stated that ""it has now been decided to legislate for compulsory recognition of trade unions based on certification procedures including compulsory poll-taking which will not be subject to the Minister's discretion"". The Committee notes these developments with interest.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to call attention to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraphs  and  above;(b) to note with interest the new procedures proposed for the determination of the most representative unions and their recognition by employers for bargaining purposes; and(c) to request the Government to keep it informed of any developments relating to this case.Geneva,  May  (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1973,Jamaica
63,".This case was examined by the Committee at its session in May  when the Committee submitted to the Governing Body a report containing its conclusions on the matter (th Report, paragraphs -).
.Jamaica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The case concerned Mr. Robert Figueroa and Dr. Trevor Munro, two officials of the University and Allied Workers' Union (UAWU), who are also members of the academic staff of the University of the West Indies. These persons were to be brought before the Professional Committee of the Senate of the University on charges arising out of incidents which took place during a strike organised by the UAWU on  October . The complainant organisation had alleged that these proceedings were in violation of the non-victimisation clause contained in a resumption of work agreement and in breach of International Labour standards.
.In reply to the allegations the Government had pointed out that the Ministry of Labour and Employment, through the conciliation services of its Industrial Relations Division, had no legal right, nor was it the practice for it to compel either employers' or employees' organisations to attend at the Ministry for the purpose of conciliation unless the service affected was one of the essential services listed in the Public Utility Undertakings and Public Services Arbitration Law. The Ministry could, therefore, proceed no further in the matter which the university authorities claimed was not a dispute but a breach of contract on the part of Mr. Figueroa and Dr. Munro, and which was being dealt with in accordance with procedures laid down by the University Council for dealing with disciplinary matters.
.In view of the contradictory views expressed by the parties and the lack of information concerning the proceedings that had been instituted by the university against Mr. Figueroa and Dr. Munro, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body to draw attention to certain general considerations which it had set forth in connection with the matters raised and to request the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the proceedings against the trade unionists in question.
.By a communication dated  May , the Government transmitted the text of the report of the Professional Committee of the University Senate in connection with the charges brought against Mr. Figueroa and Dr. Munro.
.From an examination of the reports of the Professional Committee the Committee notes that the charges brought against Mr. Figueroa and Dr. Munro, by virtue of University Ordinance No.  concerning power of appointment, promotion and dismissal (including other disciplinary control), related to such acts as disorderly conduct, or aiding and abetting to commit disorderly conduct, wilful obstruction, intimidation, and activities calculated to endanger peace and security (conspiracy to assault a member of the staff). On the basis of the evidence adduced, the Professional Committee found some of the charges proved and others not proved. In the case of Mr. Figueroa, a recommendation was made by the Professional Committee that he be censured by the University Vice-Chancellor and, as regards Dr. Munro, that the report of the Professional Committee be published to all members of the academic community as an open censure to Dr. Munro in respect of his misconduct.
.In the light of the information now at its disposal the Committee notes that charges brought against Mr. Figueroa and Dr. Munro related to acts in respect of which disciplinary procedures are provided under University Ordinance No. . It notes that none of the charges concerned the status of Mr. Figueroa and Dr. Munro as trade unionists or the exercise of what would generally be considered as normal trade union activities. In addition, as regards the alleged failure to respect the non-victimisation agreement, the Committee notes under this agreement ""there will be no victimisation of workers who went on strike and other union personnel, provided, however, that this clause shall not be regarded as altering or amending the contractual obligations and duties which any person owes to the University"".
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint of the University and Allied Workers' Union (UAWU) is contained in communications to the ILO dated  April,  May and  June . The Government sent its observations in a letter dated  February .
.Jamaica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  April , the complainant alleges that in October  there was a strike by members of the union against the management of the University of the West Indies at Mona. With officers of the Ministry of Labour and Employment acting as conciliators, a resumption-of-work agreement was signed, one of the clauses of which provided that ""There will be no victimisation of workers who went on strike, and other union personnel, provided, however, that this clause shall not be regarded as altering or amending the contractual obligations and duties which any person owes to the University.""
.Two of the persons active in the strike were Dr. Trevor Munroe, Vice-President of the UAWU and lecturer at the University in question, and Mr. Robert Figueroa, a member of the union's financial and strike Committees. In December , these trade unionists were notified that they were to be brought before the Professional Committee of Academics (a university tribunal) on charges such as intimidation, obstruction and uttering grossly offensive statements, all based on incidents which had taken place during the strike. It is of these proceedings that the union complains, on the grounds that they are in violation of the non-victimisation clause of the resumption agreement and in breach of International Labour standards, and in particular, of Article  of Convention No.  concerning workers' representatives.
.The complainant also alleges that the Ministry of Labour and Employment has refused to intervene in the matter and that the Government of Jamaica, through its representative on the university management, has agreed to these proceedings.
.In its letter of  February , the Government replies that there was indeed a strike in October , at the University of the West Indies at Mona. The Ministry of Labour and Employment intervened and it quotes a statement of Dr. Munroe praising ""the considerable and crucial role played by the Ministry of Labour and Employment in these conciliation proceedings"".
.Subsequently, according to the Government, the university authorities charged Dr. Munroe and Mr. Figueroa with serious misconduct. At the request of the UAWU the Ministry of Labour and Employment contacted the university authorities with a view to examining the matter but the university took the position that the question was a purely internal one respecting the contractual obligations to the university of Dr. Munroe and Mr. Figueroa, and that it did not constitute a trade dispute. The Ministry contacted the university's lawyers, requesting the relevant documents, but these were not forthcoming. The Government states that it understands that in the meantime the Professional Committee of Academics has handed in its reports to Messrs. Munroe and Figueroa and that the matter now rests in the hands of the University Council.
.The Government explains that the Ministry of Labour and Employment, through the conciliation services of its Industrial Relations Division, is always ready and willing to mediate in any existing trade dispute, but the Ministry has not the legal right nor is it common practice for it to compel either employers' or employees' representatives to attend at the Ministry for purposes of conciliation unless the service affected is one of the essential services listed in the Public Utility Undertakings and Public Services Arbitration Law. The Ministry could, therefore, proceed no further in the matter, which the university authorities claimed was not a dispute but a breach of contract on the part of Dr. Munroe and Mr. Figueroa and which was being dealt with in accordance with procedures laid down by the University Council for dealing with disciplinary matters. The Government notes further that Dr. Munroe himself accepted the jurisdiction of the university tribunal by indicating his intention to exercise his right to appear before it, to be legally represented and to call witnesses.
.The Committee notes that the views expressed by the parties involved in this case are to a large extent contradictory and it would be difficult for the Committee to reach a conclusion on the matters raised. However, the Committee wishes to set forth certain general considerations in connection with these matters.
.The Committee notes that proceedings are now in progress before the University Council of the University of the West Indies and that therefore no final decision has yet been taken by the employer of Messrs. Munroe and Figueroa, namely, the University of the West Indies. The Committee hopes that in reaching this decision, due account will be taken of the principle",1,1973,Jamaica
64,"that trade union officials must not suffer prejudice by reason of their trade union activities. In general terms this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds a trade union office confers on him immunity against measures such as dismissal irrespective of the circumstances. The activities of trade union officials should, however, be considered in the context of particular situations which may be especially strained and difficult in cases of labour disputes and strike action. In the present case, an additional element to be considered is the no-victimisation clause included in the resumption-of-work agreement.
.More generally, the Committee wishes to stress once again that complaints against anti-union practices should normally be examined by national machinery. Although it would be desirable to settle grievances relating to acts of anti-union discrimination wherever possible by discussion without treating the process of determining grievances as a form of litigation, in cases where there arise differences of opinion, resort should be had to impartial bodies or individuals representing the final step of the grievance procedure.
.In all these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw attention to the considerations expressed above and to request the Government to be good enough to keep it informed of the outcome of the proceedings against Messrs. Munroe and Figueroa.",0,1973,Jamaica
65,".The complaint from the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) is contained in a communication dated  April . Despite repeated requests from the Committee, the Government had not offered any specific comments on the allegations made by the complainants and the Committee therefore forwarded an urgent appeal to the Government in February  to provide the information requested. The Government then transmitted its observations by two communications received on  and  April .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WFTU states that the Government unleashed a wave of repression against the trade unions of that country, and in particular against the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), which is affiliated to it. It is claimed that on  February , the police entered the premises of the headquarters of the FUSS in San Salvador without being in possession of a warrant issued by the judicial authority for such entry, arrested two of its leaders, Jos Antonio Romn Mendoza and Rafael Aguinana Carranza, and refused to give any information as to where they were detained. Furthermore, hundreds of persons were arrested, most of them active trade unionists. The Congress of El Salvador adopted a new Penal Code forbidding meetings, demonstrations, strikes, protests against political arrests, the publication of opinions contrary to those of the Government, appeals to invalidate ballot papers, the dissemination of avant-garde ideas, etc.
.In its reply, the Government states that it is unable to make specific observations on the police action in the premises of the FUSS until the complainants provide more complete information on the matter. It states that Jos Antonio Romn Mendoza and Rafael Aguinana Carranza have never been detained. The latter had been elected a member of the Legislative Assembly and in that capacity enjoyed all the prerogatives associated with that position. The new Penal Code, which had come into force on  June , contained no provision conflicting with freedom of association.
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government and, in particular, that relating to Jos Antonio Romn Mendoza and Rafael Aguinana Carranza. The Government has nevertheless not provided information on the police action concerning the premises of the FUSS, although the complainants indicated the date and place of the alleged action. In this connection, the Committee has emphasised on various occasions that although trade unions, like other associations or persons, cannot claim immunity from search of their premises, searches should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises for charges in respect of an offence against the law and provided that the search is restricted to the purposes for which the warrant was issued.
.Moreover, the new Penal Code contains provisions punishing, for example, rebellion, sedition and uprisings (sections  et seg.) and participation in subversive associations, particularly those having as an aim the teaching, dissemination or propagation of anarchist or undemocratic theories (sections  et seg.). The Penal Code also lays down penalties for mass stoppage of work by civil servants and employees in the public sector (section ). It also provides penalties for the instigators and leaders of illegal strikes (section ). In the present case, the complainants do not provide proof that these provisions are applied in such a manner as to violate freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, according to the Government, Jos Antonio Romn Mendoza and Rafael Aguinana Carranza have never been detained; and(b) to draw the attention of the Government, in connection with police intervention in the premises of the FUSS, to the principle stated in paragraph  above.",0,1973,El Salvador
66,".The Committee already examined this case in May  and May  and presented an interim report to the Governing Body at each of those sessions. These reports are reproduced in paragraphs - of its th report and paragraphs - of its st report.
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still outstanding concerned the imprisonment of  workers of SIDERPERU. The Departmental Trade Union Federation of Workers of Ancash (FESIDETA) and  trade unions in the region requested the ILO to intercede with the Peruvian Government in order to put a stop to these injustices.
.In its reply, the Government indicated, in particular, that disturbances having nothing to do with trade union activities had taken place in May  in the Chimbote Steelworks of the State undertaking SIDERPERU. As the disturbances, which had caused considerable damage to the installations, were deliberate criminal offences, the persons thought to be responsible were being held at the disposal of the judicial authorities. The Government added that the complaint failed to give the names of the persons concerned, that membership of a trade union did not confer the right to commit offences and remain unpunished and that, as the damage caused had nothing to do with trade union activity, its authors would have to be punished by the judicial authorities in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Penal Code.
.In its th report, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, inter alia, to request the Government to supply a copy of the text of the decisions of the judicial authorities, once issued, together with the grounds adduced therefore in respect of the arrested workers.
.The Government supplied further information in a communication dated  March , in which it stated that SIDERPERU was given over to producing basic materials for national defence and that its activities were directed towards metalworking and the direct or indirect marketing of steel and allied products. According to the Government, the excellent employer-worker relations existing in the undertaking deteriorated in May  when the trade unions in the organisation called a strike as a token of solidarity with other trade union organisations at Chimbote, for reasons which had nothing to do with SIDERPERU itself. The stoppage had degenerated into an indefinite general strike which affected the activities of SIDERPERU's Chimbote plant, although declared for reasons which had nothing to do with the organisation. A group of strikers had refused access to the plant to personnel responsible for avoiding damage to the blast furnace and to the electronic and automatic equipment in the undertaking. This had resulted in serious damage to material and equipment and losses running into several million soles, and the ultimate effects had been injurious to the metalworking industry.
.The Government added that  former workers of the undertaking,  of whom were trade union leaders, had been accused of sabotage. None of them was at that time still detained; the courts had not yet pronounced their verdict and investigations were still proceeding.
.The Committee did not have any information as to whether the twelve workers concerned were being prosecuted for taking part in strike action or because they caused destruction to material and equipment. However, the courts had not yet pronounced their verdict. In May , the Committee, therefore, recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish details on the charges brought against  workers and to communicate the text of the court decision, together with the grounds adduced therefor.
.The Government pointed out in a letter of  December  that it needed to know the names of the workers in question so as to be able to state whether or not they had been involved in the events regarding which court action had been taken. It added that investigations had been opened up ""against the persons found to be responsible for the damage"" and not against the persons mentioned, and it attached copies of various case documents to its letter it stated that according to the General Secretary of the SIDERPERU Union itself, the strike action had been taken as a token of solidarity with the trade union Confederation and that the union leaders of the undertaking had not fully complied with the request by the Director-General of SIDERPERU that security personnel be nominated to prevent disturbances. The Government also stated that the investigations had led to dismissal of the charge (a copy of the dismissal findings was attached) and that no worker was in prison.
.The Committee already examined this case in May  and presented to the Governing Body at that session an interim report which is reproduced in paragraphs  to  of its th Report.
.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisations alleged that  workers had been imprisoned and that massive dismissals of trade union leaders, with loss of social benefits, had taken place. The FESIDETA (Departmental Trade Union Federation of Workers of Ancash) and  trade unions in the region requested the ILO to intercede with the Peruvian Government so as to put a stop to these injustices.
.In its reply the Government indicated that the Chimbote steel works, SIDERPERU, was a state undertaking and that, in March , at a time when production had reached a record level after various problems had been overcome, disturbances broke out in the plant for reasons that had nothing to do with trade union activities. According to the Government, these disturbances, which were nothing else than sabotage, caused considerable damage to the installations of the plant. The Government added that, since the damage was done deliberately, the persons thought to be responsible were being held at the disposal of the judicial authorities.
.The Government indicated that the complaint failed to give the names of the persons concerned and that the fact that a worker belongs to a trade union does not give him the right to commit offences and remain unpunished. It stated that those responsible for the damage done in the Chimbote steel works, which had nothing to do with trade union activity, would have to be punished by the judicial authorities in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Penal Code. The Government added that it had promulgated Legislative Decree No.  which provided for the reorganisation of SIDERPERU and authorised its management to select appropriate personnel. This recruitment was taking place without any discrimination whatsoever.
.The Committee had noted in its th Report that, according to the Government, the persons had been arrested because damage had been done to the Chimbote steel works for reasons unconnected with trade union activities, and that the persons thought to be responsible had been placed at the disposal of the judicial authorities.
.On the other hand, the Committee had noted that the Government's reply contained no information with regard to the allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union leaders. The Committee drew attention to the principle that workers - and especially trade union officials - should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures; it pointed out, however, that this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances. The Committee had considered that, in order to enable it to formulate its conclusions on this aspect of the complaint in full knowledge of the facts, it would be useful if the Government were to be requested to give details about the dismissals to which the complainants referred.
.In these circumstances, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body, in particular, to request the Government-to supply the text of the decisions of the judicial authorities, once it has been issued, together with the grounds adduced therefor in respect of the arrested workers, and to give details as to the circumstances in which the trade union leaders were dismissed, including the grounds on which they were dismissed.
.The Government supplied further information in a communication dated  March . In it stated that SIDERPERU was given over to producing basic materials for national defence and that its activities were directed towards metalworking and the direct or indirect commercialisation of steel and allied products. According to the Government the excellent employer-worker relations existing in the undertaking deteriorated in May  when the trade unions in the organisation called a stoppage as a token of solidarity with other trade union organisations at Chimbote, for reasons which had nothing to do with SIDERPERU itself. The stoppage degenerated into an indefinite general strike which affected the activities of SIDERPERU's Chimbote plant, although declared for reasons which had nothing to do with the organisation. A group of strikers refused to allow personnel responsible for avoiding damage to the blast furnace",0,1973,Peru
67,"and to the electronic and automatic equipment in the undertaking to enter the plant. This resulted in serious damage to material and equipment and losses running to several million soles, and the ultimate effects were injurious to the metalworking industry.
.The Government added that this action constituted a grave offence under the Stability Act, since the activities of certain individuals were detrimental to the finances of the undertaking, and it was punished by the dismissal of  workers with loss of social benefits. The Government went on to say that the action taken was supported by a majority of the staff and after the guilty men had been dismissed output became normal again. Under these circumstances, the above-mentioned Legislative Decree No.  respecting the reorganisation of SIDERPERU had been repealed and a Committee set up to consider the case of each worker dismissed with a view to his reinstatement. The Government added that the great majority of those dismissed had found work elsewhere.
.On the other hand, the Government stated that  former workers of the undertaking, four of whom were trade union leaders, were accused of sabotage. None of them was at present being detained: the courts had not yet announced their verdict and investigations were still proceeding. Lastly, the Government indicated that industrial relations in the undertaking were now such that it had been possible to adopt a policy of highly favourable wage increases.
.The available information shows that the dispute originated in an indefinite strike as a token of solidarity. Forty-eight workers were dismissed with loss of social benefits and  were arrested. According to the Government a group of strikers refused to allow persons responsible for protecting the material and equipment to enter the plant, and this action, resulting in serious material and financial losses, was the reason for the dismissals. In any event a Committee has been set up to consider the case of each worker dismissed with a view to his reinstatement and the great majority of them have found work elsewhere.
.As far as the  workers charged with sabotage are concerned, the Committee does not have information as to whether the workers concerned are being prosecuted for taking part in strike action or because they caused destruction to material and equipment. However, the courts have not yet announced their verdict. Under these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to furnish details on the charges laid against the  workers and to communicate the text of the court decision together with the grounds adduced therefor, it being understood that the Committee will present a further report when it has received this information.
.The joint complaint by the Non-Manual Workers' Union of the SIDER Metalworks, the Manual Workers' Union of SIDER and the Departmental Trade Union Federation of Workers of Ancash (FESIDETA) is contained in a communication dated  June .
.The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations in a communication dated  February .
.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication the complainant organisations allege that eleven workers, including two women, have been imprisoned and that massive dismissals of trade union leaders, with loss of social benefits, have taken place. The FESIDETA and forty-two trade unions in the region request the ILO to make representations to the Peruvian Government so as to put a stop to these injustices.
.In its communication the Government begins by stating that the Chimbote Steelworks, SIDERPERU, is a state undertaking which, because of its very humane and fair policies, has no labour problems with its employees.
.With regard to the complainants' allegations, the Government states that in March , at a time when production had reached a record level after various problems had been overcome, disturbances broke out in the plant for reasons that had nothing to do with trade union activities. According to the Government, these disturbances, which were nothing else than sabotage, caused considerable damage to the installations of the plant. The Government adds that since the damage was done deliberately, the persons thought to be responsible are being held at the disposal of the judicial authorities.
.The Government considers the complaint to be unfounded for the following reasons: it fails to give the names of the persons concerned; the fact that a worker belongs to a trade union does not give him the right to commit offences and remain unpunished, and those responsible for the damage done in the Chimbote Steelworks, which had nothing to do with trade union activity, must be punished by the judicial authorities in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Penal Code. The Government adds that it has issued a legislative decree which provides for the reorganisation of SIDERPERU and invites its management to select appropriate personnel. This recruitment is taking place without any discrimination whatsoever.
.The Committee notes that the allegations made by the complainants concern, on the one hand, the arrest of eleven employees of the SIDERPERU Steelworks and, on the other, the dismissal of numerous trade union leaders from the same undertaking. As concerns the former allegations, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these persons were arrested because damage had been done to the Chimbote Steelworks for reasons unconnected with trade union activities and in consequence the persons thought to be responsible were placed at the disposal of the judicial authorities. In accordance with its usual practice the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to supply the text of the decision of these authorities, together with the grounds adduced therefor, once these are handed down.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union leaders, the Committee notes that the Government's reply contains no information on the subject. In such cases the Committee has always drawn attention to the principle that workers - and especially trade union officials - should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such as dismissal, demotion, transfer or other prejudicial measures. However, this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds a trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances. The Committee considers that, in order to enable it to come to its conclusions on this aspect of the complaint in full knowledge of the facts, it would be useful if the Government were to be requested to give details about the dismissals to which the complainants refer.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the arrest of employees of the SIDERPERU Steelworks to take note of the fact that they have been placed at the disposal of the judicial authorities, and to request the Government to supply the text of the decision of these authorities together with the grounds adduced therefor, once these are handed down;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union leaders(i) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above;(ii) to request the Government to give details as to the circumstances in which trade union leaders were dismissed, including the grounds on which they were dismissed;(c) to take note of the present interim report, on the understanding that the Committee will report to the Governing Body again once it has received the information requested from the Government.",0,1973,Peru
68,"Committee the Governing Body drew the attention of the Government to this latter point in November . The Governing Body expressed its concern at the slowness in adopting legislation based on principles of freedom of association and requested the Government to indicate the date on which it envisaged the adoption and application of the final text of the law.
.The Committee also noted that the number of joint Committees in operation had noticeably increased. It repeated that these bodies should in no case substitute for trade union organisations and that workers' representatives on them should be freely elected without it being possible for them to be prevented from being elected because of their previous trade union activity. These bodies should, as in other countries, have a useful role to play in industrial relations but, in the present trade union situation in the country, should only be seen as a transitional measure until a legal way could be found - and this should be in the near future - for workers to be represented by trade unions. With this proviso, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to continue to provide information on developments in the situation concerning these Committees.
.The Committee was also called upon to examine the cases of numerous detained trade unionists. Although the number of prisoners who had been judged by the courts was increasing, it noted, many trade unionists were still awaiting trial; some of them had been doing so for long periods. The Committee accordingly once again expressed its concern at the slowness of the judicial procedure. Furthermore, it noted that Mr. Hctor Enrique Altesor Hafliger appeared to be still in prison after the decision to abandon legal proceedings against him. The Government also stated that a certain number of the persons mentioned had been released, but did not supply details of the specific offences for which they had been prosecuted or sentenced (in particular copy of the judgements rendered). On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body regretted this absence of additional information.
.The complainants had also made allegations regarding conditions of imprisonment and the right to defence. In connection with the latter point, they stated that, at first, civilian lawyers had been able to carry out their functions and defend prisoners. This situation had deteriorated progressively and they had been confronted with obstacles in the exercise of their profession, especially as regards being able to communicate with their clients. Subsequently, stated the complainants, lawyers had been arrested and accused, for example, of complicity with the prisoners; others had been threatened and had left the country. Those who were released could no longer exercise their professional activities. As for the detained workers, they were informed, often after lengthy imprisonment, that they must choose a lawyer in  hours. Having no contact with the outside they were obliged to accept a lawyer appointed on their behalf so that the trial was not delayed further. In this connection, one of the representatives of the complainant organisations at the Committee's sittings of  and  May , who was arrested in  and again in , described his personal case and the torture to which he had been subjected. He added that all prisoners were tortured. Other allegations referred to cases of ill treatment suffered even recently by imprisoned trade unionists (Mr. Iguini).
.The Government had not replied to the allegations concerning ill-treatment inflicted on prisoners and the precarious nature of the right to defence. The Committee considered that detailed replies on this vitally important aspect of the case would enable it to ascertain whether the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants were enjoying full guarantees as regards the conditions of their imprisonment and the right to defence. The Governing Body also regretted the absence of observations from the Government on these aspects of the case. Moreover, according to certain allegations, Mr. Hugo Pereyra, a builders' trade union leader, had died as a result of ill-treatment. The Committee also requested the Government to state whether any investigation had been made into the circumstances of his death and to communicate the results of such investigations.
.On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body requested the Government to transmit information and observations on the various aspects of the case. In particular, it requested the Government to communicate detailed information on the situation of the trade unionists listed in the Annex to the th Report in respect of whom it had not yet supplied details, and on the investigations made in the case of Mr. Hugo Pereyra (paragraph ) and on the present situation of Mr. Altesor Hafliger (paragraph ).
.The Trade Unions International of Transport, Ports and Fishery Workers protests in general terms against trade union persecution in the country in its telegram of  October . In a letter of  December  the World Federation of Trade Unions, on the basis of statements by the relatives of the person concerned, alleges that Oscar Tassino Atzu was arrested on  July  at a certain address in Montevideo by a member of the joint armed forces and that he has since then disappeared; it has not been possible to discover his whereabouts despite repeated approaches by his relatives to the military authorities and the police. This information, adds the WFTU, contradicts that given by the Government to the Committee for its November  Session (according to this information Mr. Tassino Atzu had been arrested on to February  but had been released the same day). The WFTU states that it has fears for the life of Mr. Tassino Atzu. The Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees, for its part, alleges, in a communication received on  January , that the trade union leader Adolfo Drescher was transferred from his place of imprisonment two weeks earlier and that he has since then disappeared; in this case, too, the complainant organisation says that it has fears for Mr. Drescher's life.
.In its letter of  January  the Government stresses, in connection with the legislation on occupational associations which it has announced, that its main objective is national reconstruction, which needs to be carried out at a reasonable pace. This process, it adds, includes the adoption of trade union legislation to guarantee workers' rights and to protect them in the defence of their interests. It is taking place more rapidly than foreseen. The Government stresses that its attitude is one of permanent co-operation with the ILO, to which it has furnished an unlimited supply of information on the process on which it has embarked. As regards the date envisaged for the adoption and application of the final text of the law, the Government considers that it is hazardous to name definite dates: consultations must be held on the draft Bill and comments supplied as regards its content; the next stage, which will follow immediately, will be the preparation of the Bill to be sent to the Council of State for this legislative organ to discuss, analyse and finally approve the law. The Government nevertheless states that it is determined to pass legislation in the near future.
.As regards the obligation placed by the draft Bill on trade unionists to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" the Government remarks that this arises out of section  of the Constitution of the Republic, under which the nation has adopted a democratic republican form of government; respect for this provision is a basic and imperative requirement for citizens. The obligation laid on trade union leaders is not discriminatory either in form or in substance; it cannot give rise to abuses since the criterion to be applied is expressly stated in the Constitution. The purpose of this provision is to prevent trade union officials from using their position to make attacks by unlawful means on the democratic republican order enshrined in the Constitution. Moreover, this obligation has existed for many years under Acts Nos. , of  February  and , of  August  (respecting the status of public officials), as well as under Act No. , of  March , which are all quoted in the draft Bill.
.The Government next supplies the following statistics on the joint Committees:  are in operation in the textile industries, electricity, the chemical industries, and the sugar and tobacco industries;  others are in the course of Constitution and will shortly be established in the private banking sector, the glass industry, the dairy products industry, the metallurgical industry, the textile industry, the race tracks, cloth manufacturing, and the manufacture of containers.
.The Governing Body regretted the absence of additional information on the precise allegations made against the trade unionists who had been prosecuted or sentenced (including copies of the judgements) and the absence of observations on the allegations concerning ill-treatment of prisoners and obstruction of their right of defence. In this connection the Government states that it has answered all the requests addressed to it and has supplied a vast volume of facts and all the",0,1973,Uruguay
69,".The Committee has already examined this case at its th Session (February ), when it submitted to the Governing Body interim conclusions contained in paragraphs - of its rd Report. That Report was adopted by the Governing Body at its rd (May-June ) Session.
.Guatemala has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state that the trade union movement in Guatemala is encountering great hardship and that there is a concerted campaign on the part of employers to destroy trade unionism in the country by forcing workers to relinquish membership in trade unions or else be dismissed.
.The complainants provide several examples of such, action. They allege, for instance, that on  June  the workers of the Fbricas Electrnicas Unidas company established a union. The President of the company is alleged to have responded by mass dismissals ( to date) and threatened to continue this policy of dismissal if the union were not dissolved.
.The complainants also allege that on  November  a union of the workers of the Fbrica de Plsticos Zelaya Zimeri y Cia. Ltda was formed. The management summarily dismissed all workers who became members of the union, including the officers of the Executive Committee. As a result the union has ceased to exist.
.Similarly, on  December  the workers at the Laboratorios Pierre Bonin Sucesores Cia. Ltda established a union, but because of the immediate wave of dismissals which followed the rest of the workers showed no further interest in joining the union.
.The complainants stress that this is only a partial list and that very large numbers of workers have been sanctioned by various managements on the sole grounds of having joined a trade union.
.Complaints in respect of these cases have been filed with the national labour authorities; but, the complainants allege, no effort has been made to force the employers to comply with the laws forbidding such acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The Government replied by transmitting the reports of various departments of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The officer in charge of the Workers' Protection Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security stated that departmental policy had always been to ensure compliance with the statutory provisions protecting freedom of association and to help the workers to unionise in every way possible. If in certain cases the authorities had been slow to act, the officer continued, this was usually because of a lack of co-operation on the part of the unions themselves, since they did not comply with the requirements of the law when submitting complaints.
.The National Department of Labour Inspection for Industry, Commerce and Services stated that the allegations made by the FASGUA concerning the inaction of the labour authorities were untrue. It went on to say that all the legal formalities in the trade union field had been undertaken, such, for example, as checking the number of workers at work on the date of the election, the denouncing of collective agreements, collective bargaining warnings to employers to reinstate dismissed union officers and legal proceedings before the competent court with a view to penalties being imposed.
.The same Department also stated that its function was to act as conciliator in occupational disputes and to seek solutions to them through the application of Guatemalan labour legislation. It pointed out that sanctions were applicable to employers committing breaches of the right to organise freely. Its competence was limited by the provisions of the Labour Code, and once all possibilities of administrative intervention had been exhausted without resolving the dispute, the latter had to be referred to the labour courts. In certain cases where breaches of the law had been committed the General Inspectorate of Labour instigated court proceedings with a view to securing the imposition of appropriate penalties. The Department also stated that where delay occurred in the handling of cases this was not the fault of the Department, but of the unions, which did not comply with the relevant provisions of the law.
.On the basis of these statements the Government affirmed in conclusion that its general policy was one of support for freedom of association and the right of workers to organise and that the appropriate government departments had taken all necessary and possible steps to ensure the protection of those rights.
.The Committee noted the statements of the Government concerning the latter's general policy in labour matters but noted also that the Government had not provided any information concerning the specific allegations made by the complainants and the steps taken by the labour authorities in the cases of the workers of the Fbricas Electrnicas Unidas, the Fbrica de Plsticos Zelava Zimeri y Cia. Ltda and the Laboratorios Pierre Bonin Sucesores Cia. Ltda, who had been allegedly dismissed on the sole grounds of being members of a trade union.
.The Committee therefore recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to be good enough to provide precise information concerning the specific allegations made by the complainants and the steps taken by the labour authorities in connection therewith.
.The Government replied in a communication dated  August . It states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare made a thorough investigation of the matters raised and established that the workers' unions in the undertakings referred to in the complaint had not obtained the approval of their statutes or permission to register as unions on the grounds that they did not have the minimum number of members required for the establishment of a union under the Labour Code. It points out that the facts referred to occurred in  and  and that at present there is no outstanding request on this subject from the trade union federation which submitted the complaint to the ILO.
.In the first place, it is clear from the information available that officials of the Ministry of Labour can intervene in matters such as those referred in the complaint. In this connection, the Committee took note, in an earlier case concerning Guatemala, of information from the Government stating that any person who had been the victim of a discriminatory measure was fully free to lodge a complaint on the matter with the Inspectorate-General of Labour so that the latter could warn the employer concerned and if necessary bring the case before the courts. The Committee drew attention to article  (c) of the Guatemalan Labour Code, which states that an employer shall not ""compel or endeavour to compel an employee, by any means whatsoever, to withdraw from the lawfully constituted trade union or group to which he belongs or to join any such union or group"". Article  of the Code stipulates the penalties for breaches of this provision.
.The Committee also pointed out that under article  (d) of the Labour Code the dismissal of the members of the Executive Committee of a union (a maximum of five persons) is prohibited during their period of office unless the employer first furnishes evidence, in accordance with the usual procedure for the termination of a contract, that sufficient grounds exist. To this end the Labour and Social Welfare Tribunals are required to deal with cases of this kind as speedily as possible. The same protection is extended to all the members of the provisional executive Committee of a trade union which is being set up, on condition that they are not more than nine in number and that they have given prior notice of their election to the Inspectorate-General of Labour.
.In the case under consideration the complainants allege that on numerous occasions the intervention of the government authorities had been vainly sought to secure compliance with the law. They quote three cases in which employers dismissed large numbers of members of unions in process of establishment. The Government has replied that complaints of this type are given priority treatment; that the Labour Inspectorate had instituted the necessary proceedings; and that the fault for any delays lies with the unions themselves, which have not complied with the law. The Government also states that, in the particular cases referred to in the complaint, the organisations concerned had not obtained approval of their statutes or permission to register as trade unions because they did not have the minimum numbers of members stipulated in the Labour Code (article  of which states that there must be at least twenty workers to form a trade union).
.The Government has not supplied any specific information on the measures taken by the Labour Inspectorate in the cases referred to by complainants or on the outcome of those measures. In addition, it is not impossible that the failure of these unions to reach the minimum number of twenty members may be due to the dismissal of members by the employer for having taken part in the establishment of the said unions.
.The Committee has already recalled the principle, laid down in Article  of Convention No. , that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against",0,1973,Guatemala
70,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1973,Dominican Republic
71,"accusation in a number of the judgements rendered. The public nature of judicial decisions is, moreover, a generally recognised principle (see, for example, section () of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights).
.The Committee also notes that the Government confines itself to rejecting the allegations regarding the obstruction of the right to defence. These allegations, which are referred to in paragraph  and which relate to a general situation, were formulated by the complainants in their oral statements to the Committee in May .
.The Committee also notes that Manuel Pieiro Pena, an official of UNTMRA, appears to have remained under arrest after serving his sentence, to judge from the most recent information furnished by the Government to the effect that his release is under consideration. In this respect the Committee wishes to point out, as it has done in an earlier case, that the detention of trade unionists, if it followed an acquittal by the competent courts, or after they had served their sentences, would constitute a violation of freedom of association.
.As regards the trade union situation in general, the Committee notes the latest information communicated by the Government regarding the draft Bill on occupational associations. The Government points out, in particular, that it is in the process of consultations over this draft Bill with the workers' and employers' organisations and that the text of the Bill will be submitted to the Council of State. In February  the Committee considered that it was urgent for trade unions to be allowed to carry on their activities without hindrance, in law as well as in fact, since this was a necessary precondition for the establishment of a harmonious system of industrial relations; the adoption of an Act on occupational associations should be a decisive step in this direction. It had examined in detail the provisions of the draft Bill, which, it emphasised, had certain positive features, such as the right to form occupational associations without previous authorisation and to set up second- and third-degree organisations. Nevertheless, the Committee added, a number of other provisions did not appear to be fully compatible with certain principles of freedom of association, and it made observations with a view to the re-examination of these provisions in order to ensure that the legislation which was to be adopted was in conformity with these principles and with the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay.
.These observations related firstly to the conditions to be fulfilled by trade union officials, in particular the obligation to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" and to have belonged to the branch of activity represented by the union for at least two years. The Committee was also of the opinion that workers should be able to decide whether they preferred to establish, at the primary level, a works union or another form of basic organisation, such as an industrial or craft union. The Committee also expressed its views on the provisions under which the aims of organisations must be exclusively occupational and have no reference to politics and that organisations and their members must respect the law of the land. In this respect, the Committee pointed out, the national provisions on the settlement of collective labour disputes and strikes, on the right of assembly or freedom of expression for organised workers, must be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee noted that several sections of the draft Bill regulated in considerable detail various aspects of the internal administration of trade unions, and in this connection recalled that even if some of these provisions might be designed to secure more efficient operation of trade union organisations, the idea underlying Article  (and Article ) of Convention No.  is that workers and employers should be allowed to decide for themselves what rules should be observed for the administration of their organisations and elections held therein. The Committee added that, if the draft were to be adopted in its present form, magistrates would be under the obligation, in the event of refusal or withdrawal of registration, to apply provisions which are not fully compatible with the provisions of Convention No. .
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the detained trade unionists:(i) to take note of the most recent information transmitted by the Government, in particular the release of ten of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints;(ii) likewise to note that even at a recent date trade unionists such as Rosario Pietraroia and Rubn Acasuso were given harsh prison sentences, and to regret that the Government has not supplied more detailed information - including the judgements rendered - on the facts imputed to the trade unionists who have been prosecuted or sentenced for acts considered by the Government to lie outside the scope of trade union activities;(iii) to request the Government to communicate detailed information on the case of Mr. Manuel Pieiro Pena, an official of UNTMRA, whose release is still under consideration after he has served his sentence;(b) as regards the Bill on occupational associations:(i) to take note of the Government's statement that the observations of the Committee on the draft Bill will be taken into consideration during the finalisation of the text which will be submitted to the Council of State and that the Government is carrying out consultations on this draft Bill with the workers' and employers' organisations;(ii) to stress once again the importance of the early promulgation of the Act, the final text of which should be in full conformity with the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Uruguay;(iii) to request the Government to indicate the date on which it envisages the adoption and application of the final text of the Act, and to supply any further information on developments in this area;(c) to request the Government to send the information requested in clauses (a) and (b) above by  September  at the latest; and(d) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.After the second direct contacts mission in Uruguay in April  the Committee noted that there had been no change in the legal position of trade unions since the first mission in June and July . What had changed was the factual situation: although that of the unions affiliated to the General Confederation of Workers of Uruguay (CGTU) had improved and they were able to perform certain internal activities (meetings, elections, etc.), the affiliates of the National Workers' Convention (CMT), which had been dissolved by the Government after the change of regime in , appeared to have remained to a large extent inactive; many of their leaders were under arrest, had left the country or had been dismissed; the premises of certain of these unions were under police control, closed, under surveillance, etc. As for industrial relations activity, the extent of recognition of the unions of CGTU and their leaders depended on whether they were on good terms with the employers or the heads of their public administrative services. As to the unions affiliated to CMT, these did not appear to be recognised either in the private or in the public sector.
.In the information which it supplied to the Committee for its November  Session, the Government referred, as it had done on earlier occasions, to the subversive activities with which it had had to deal and which had constituted the reasons for the exceptional measures taken. In this connection the Committee emphasised that there should be no confusion between trade unions' performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers, and the possible pursuit by certain of their members of other activities having nothing to do with trade union functions. The penal responsibilities which such persons must incur by such acts should no way result in measures amounting to depriving the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action. The Committee regretted that despite the time which had elapsed the trade union organisations were still encountering serious difficulties; the continuing existence of serious divergences between the Conventions on freedom of association on the one hand and national law and practice on the other was a matter for great concern.
.Shortly before the Committee's November  Session the Government sent the text of a draft Bill on occupational associations prepared by a group of experts. Because this text was received at such a late date the Committee was unable to examine it in substance at that session. It noted with interest, however, that the Bill envisaged the possibility of setting up organisations of first, second and third degree. On the other hand, it stressed that the obligation of trade union leaders to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" could give rise to abuses in the absence of precise criteria on which a decision of the courts could be based in the event of a trade union leader being accused of failing to abide by his declaration. On the recommendation of the",0,1973,Uruguay
72,"additional information asked for. What is more, it has done this although the requests in a large number of cases referred to persons who were not trade union leaders but who were merely involved in offences under the ordinary or military penal codes. The judgements, continues the Government, are a matter for the competent judicial bodies and the persons concerned. The sections of the penal code quoted are self-explanatory and show that the parsons concerned were prosecuted for offences and not because they were trade union officials. According to the Government the information provided so far is clear evidence that all the prisoners have now been brought before the competent judicial authorities and that their right of defence has not been obstructed. The Government rejects the complaints concerning ill-treatment of prisoners, which are, it says, couched in general and imprecise terms and are unaccompanied by the merest shred of evidence; the Government considers that it is its duty to defend itself against mere presumptions put forward in a spirit of utter irresponsibility.
.In addition, the Government supplies information on all the trade unionists listed in the Annex to the th Report, apart from the persons who have been unconditionally released (including Oscar Tassino Atzu, who is again mentioned by the complainants as having been arrested): the situation of most of these trade unionists remains unchanged; information supplied on the others is contained in the Annex to the present report. In particular, the Government mentions that Hctor Enrique Altesor Hafliger left the country on  March  after a court decision to abandon his case on  June . The Government also recalls that it has already supplied a report on the autopsy carried out on Hugo Pereira Cunha who, according to some allegations, was said to have died as a result of ill-treatment; according to this report, death had been caused by a blood clot followed by a haemorrhage; the Government communicates the text of the court decision to close the proceedings relating to Mr. Pereira's death. In the preamble to this decision it is stated that Mr. Pereira died at the central hospital of the armed forces, but that the investigation, which was conducted in accordance with military court procedure, was dropped in the absence of any proof that a crime had been committed. In a communication of  February , the Government states that Adolfo Drescher had, on  November , been brought before the military court on the basis of the following crimes: subversive association (section V of the Military Penal Code), theft (section  of the ordinary Penal Code), forgery and alteration of official documents by a private individual (section  of the same Code).
.The Committee takes note of this information. The Government has already declared on an earlier occasion that the normalisation of the trade union situation has to be analysed within the broader framework of the political and institutional normalisation of the country. In this connection the Committee emphasised that, although respect for freedom of association is closely bound up with respect for civil liberties in general, as was stated by the International Labour Conference in  in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, it was nevertheless important, with this reservation, to distinguish between the recognition of freedom of association and questions relating to a country's political evolution. The Committee remains convinced that trade union legislation and the reform of a country's political institutions are two separate matters, and that it is urgent for trade unions to be allowed to carry on their activities without hindrance, in law as well as in fact, since this is a necessary precondition for the establishment of a harmonious system of industrial relations. The adoption of a law on occupational associations should be a decisive step in this direction. The Committee trusts that this law will enter into force in the very near future.
.The Committee has examined the provisions of the draft Bill on occupational associations, a copy of which was communicated to it by the Government shortly before the November  Session. This text, as the Committee has already had occasion to remark, has certain positive features, such as the right to form occupational associations without previous authorisation and to set up second and third-degree organisations. Nevertheless, as regards a number of other provisions which do not appear to be fully compatible with certain principles of freedom of association, the Committee feels obliged to make observations with a view to the re-examination of the provisions in order to ensure that the legislation which is shortly to be adopted is in conformity with these principles and with the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay.
.The Committee has already remarked that the obligation laid on trade union leaders to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" may give rise to abuses. The draft Bill does not state what specific acts are deemed to constitute breaches of faith in democracy, and thus renders legal supervision of the application of this provision impossible. The other conditions of eligibility for trade union office - which differ from those required of leaders of employers' associations - also impose restrictions on the right of workers to elect their representatives in full freedom. In particular, under sections  and  of the draft Bill read in conjunction, trade union officials must have belonged to the branch of activity represented by the union for at least two years. The Committee has already pointed out in other cases that, if such a requirement applied to all office-holders in trade union organisations, it would be incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.As regards the establishment of trade union organisations, the Committee is of the opinion that workers should be able to decide whether they prefer to establish, at the primary level, a works union - the only possibility allowed under section  of the draft Bill, apart from certain exceptions - or another form of basic organisation, such as an industrial or craft union.
.The aims of the organisation must, according to section  of the draft Bill, be exclusively occupational and have no reference to politics. In this connection, the Committee has already expressed the view, in an earlier case concerning Uruguay, that a general prohibition of political activities of any kind would not seem to be compatible with the principles and guarantees of Convention No. , and it would also seem to be unrealistic as regards its application in actual practice. For instance, trade unions may wish to make publicly known their position on matters of economic and social policy which affect their members. The Committee added that States should be able, without prohibiting in general terms political activities by occupational organisations, to entrust to the judicial authorities the task of repressing abuses which might, in certain cases, be committed by organisations which had lost sight of the fact that their fundamental objective should be the economic and social advancement of their members. Furthermore, a number of sections of the draft Bill prescribe that organisations and their members must respect the law of the land (sections ,  and ). In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , which states that in exercising the rights provided for in the Convention workers and their organisations, like other persons or organised collectivities, shall respect the law of the land, which shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in Convention No. . The Committee accordingly wishes to point out that the national provisions on the settlement of collective labour disputes and strikes, on the right of assembly or freedom of expression for organised workers, must be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.The draft Bill also regulates in considerable detail various aspects of the internal administration of trade unions; occupational associations may at any time be called upon to supply reports on their activities to the authorities (section ); trade union assemblies may not last more than four hours and must have a quorum of at least  per cent of the members (section ). It is compulsory to vote at trade union elections (section ); a plebiscite is required for the examination of draft collective agreements (section ); members who abstain from voting during elections or plebiscites are suspended for one year (section ); when trade union organisations act in a representative capacity, the votes taken must be public (section ); at the time of elections and plebiscites various formalities must be complied with at the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare (registry of lists and notifications the nature of which is not specified in the draft Bill; section ); lower-level trade unions are responsible for decisions taken by higher-level organisations, unless their representatives on the executive have voted against the decision engaging their responsibility or if they are disavowed by the organisation in such a manner that the",0,1973,Uruguay
73,"decision may be reconsidered (section ).
.Even if some of these provisions may be designed to secure more efficient operation of trade union organisations, the Committee wishes to recall that Articles  and  of Convention No.  protect the autonomy of these organisations; in particular, they guarantee the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. The Convention adds that the public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. In the above-mentioned case concerning Uruguay, the Committee considered that legislation which minutely regulates the internal election procedures of a trade union is incompatible with the rights afforded to trade anions by the Convention it also considered that legislation imposing penalties on workers who do not participate in elections is not in harmony with the provisions of the Convention. Generally speaking, as indicated, the principles established in Article  of the Convention do not prevent the control of the internal acts of a trade union if those internal acts violate legal provisions or union rules. Nevertheless, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, this control should be exercised by the competent judicial authorities. The Committee is of the opinion that these considerations are also valid in the present case as regards the various provisions mentioned in the previous paragraph. The idea underlying Article  of Convention No.  is that workers and employers should be allowed to decide for themselves what rules should be observed for the administration of their organisations and elections held therein.
.The various obligations mentioned in the foregoing paragraph constitute conditions for the registration of a trade union - which is compulsory (section ) and necessary for the granting of legal personality (section ) - and failure to comply with them can result in deregistration. The labour authorities are competent to permit or refuse registration (section ), but in accordance with Constitutional principles (sections  ff of the Constitution) a petition against an administrative decision may be filed with a court of law. Furthermore, under sections  and  of the draft Bill, the courts are competent to decide on the suspension of the association and the cancellation of registration. Nevertheless, if the draft were to be adopted in its present form, magistrates would be under the obligation, in the event of refusal or withdrawal of registration, to apply provisions which are not, as already mentioned, fully compatible with the provisions of Convention No. .
.Moreover, the number of joint Committees in operation in undertakings has not increased beyond the figures given in November , although the Government stated in May  that a figure of  Committees would be reached after a period of  to  months.
.The Committee notes the information supplied on the numerous trade unionists who are under arrest, in which the Government reports six further cases of conditional or unconditional release. As regards the persons who are still under arrest the Government confines itself to quoting sections of the ordinary or military penal codes under which trade unionists have been prosecuted or sentenced by military courts, that is to say it indicates the kinds of acts which they have committed or allegedly committed, but it does not supply details of the specific offences with which they are charged in each case; nor has it communicated the texts of the judgements rendered in each case, as requested by the Governing Body. At an earlier stage of examination of this case, the Government supplied information of this kind during a direct contacts mission; the information gathered gave the impression that the criminal proceedings set in motion were aimed first of all at activities of a political character considered by the Government to endanger security and public order. However, the representative of the Director-General found that some of the charges were accompanied by other accusations linked to the activities of the CNT, which was dissolved by the Government in . In a smaller number of cases the Committee noted that the persons concerned had been arrested for reasons which could be considered as being linked solely with their trade union activities.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in connection with the present case, where persons have been sentenced on grounds having no relation to trade union rights the matter falls outside its competence. It has nevertheless emphasised that the question whether such a matter is one relating to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned. If in certain cases the Committee has reached the conclusion that allegations relating to measures taken against trade unionists did not call for further examination, this was only after it had received information from the Government showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measures were in no way occasioned by trade union activities but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. In such cases, the Committee, taking the view that individuals have the right to be presumed innocent until found guilty, has considered that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures it had taken were in no way occasioned by the trade union activities of the individual concerned. In the present case, and in the absence of more detailed information, the Committee has no facts at its disposal enabling it to ascertain whether the trade unionists were sentenced purely for reasons unconnected with their trade union office or activities.
.The Committee also regrets that the Government has not supplied detailed observations on the allegations relating to the precariousness of the right to defence and the ill-treatment allegedly suffered by certain prisoners whom the complainants mention by name. The Committee notes, however, that the investigation into the death of Hugo Pereira Cunha has been dropped for lack of any evidence that the crime was committed by the military. Furthermore, the complainants state that Oscar Tassino Atzu (a UTE trade union official) has not been released, as stated by the Government in information communicated to the Committee, but that he was arrested on  July .
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the draft Bill on occupational associations;
.After the second direct contacts mission in Uruguay in April  the Committee noted that there had been no change in the legal-position of trade unions since the first mission in June and July . What had changed was the factual situation: although that of the unions affiliated to the General Confederation of Workers of Uruguay (CGTU) had improved and they were able to perform certain internal activities (meetings, elections, etc.), the affiliates of the National Workers' Convention (CNT), which had been dissolved by the Government after the change of regime in , appeared to have remained to a large extent inactive: many of their leaders were under arrest, had left the country or had been dismissed; the premises of certain of these unions were under police control, closed, under surveillance, etc. As for industrial relations activity, the extent of recognition of the unions of CGTU and their leaders depended on whether they were on good terms with the employers or the heads of their public administrative services. As to the unions affiliated to the CNT, these did not appear to be recognised either in the private or in the public sector.
.In the information which it supplied to the Committee for its November  session, the Government referred, as it had done on earlier occasions, to the subversive activities with which it had had to deal and which had constituted the reasons for the exceptional measures taken. Normalisation of occupational organisations, in the Government's opinion, had to be analysed within the broader framework of the political and institutional normalisation of the country. In this respect the Committee emphasised that, although respect for freedom of association was closely bound up with respect for civil liberties in general, it was nevertheless important, with this reservation, to distinguish between the recognition of freedom of association and questions relating to a country's political evolution. Neither should there be confusion between trade unions' performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers, and the possible pursuit by certain of their members of other activities having nothing to do with trade union functions. The penal responsibilities which such persons might incur by such acts should in no way result in measures amounting to depriving the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action. The Committee regretted that despite the time which had elapsed the trade union organisations were still encountering serious difficulties; the continuing existence of serious divergences between the Conventions on freedom of association or the one hand and national law and practice on the other was a matter for great concern.
.The Government subsequently stated -that the working party",0,1973,Uruguay
74,"of experts entrusted with the preparation of a draft Bill concerning trade union organisations had completed the first of the tasks assigned to it by ministerial resolution, namely the preparation of guidelines for the Bill. This preliminary document had been submitted to the executive for study and had been approved by the President of the Republic on  April . The Government communicated a copy of the guidelines for the Bill. The exchange of views between the Committee and the representatives of the complainants and those of the Minister of Labour at its sittings of  and  May  concerned, among other things, this aspect of the case. The Committee considered that the document in question contained positive aspects such as the right of occupational associations to be constituted without prior authorisation. Certain basic ideas contained in the Bill should, however, be made more precise, taking account of the standards contained in the Conventions on freedom of association. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body in June  requested the Government to indicate the date on which it envisaged the adoption and the bringing into force of the final text of the law. It also noted that, according to the representatives of the Government, the draft Bill on trade unions would be completed in the near future and expressed the hope that the Government would be able to communicate a copy thereof in time for the Committee's November  session.
.As regards the present situation, the Committee noted the slowness with which the joint Committees referred to in the Decree of  February  had been set up. Although the Committee considered that these bodies were no substitute for trade union organisations, they could play a useful role in the field of industrial relations. The workers' representatives should therefore not be kept out of the Committees because of their past trade union activities. Furthermore, there should also be such Committees for the public sector. On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body stressed the importance of guaranteeing the free election of workers to these Committees and requested the Government to supply information on the evolution of the situation in this respect.
.The Committee also noted with concern the slowness of the judicial procedure concerning detained trade unionists. Although the fact of exercising a trade union activity or holding trade union office did not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the prolonged detention of trade unionists without being promptly tried could constitute a serious handicap to the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee noted, for example, that of the  trade unionists whom the representative of the Director-General had been able to meet or whose files he had been able to examine during his mission to Uruguay in April ,  still awaited trial, in some cases for several years, and only  had been provisionally -released. Nevertheless, certain trade unionists had been brought to trial and sentenced on account of subversive activities. The Committee wished to receive in these cases a copy of the judgements handed down, with the reasons adduced therefor.
.The representatives of the WCL and the WFTU also submitted in May  lists of numerous persons, particularly trade union leaders, stated to have been arrested or to have disappeared. The names of the persons in respect of whom the complainants gave details regarding their trade union membership, activities or functions were communicated to the Government. The representatives of the complainants also made statements regarding conditions of detention and the right of defence. As regards the latter point, they stated that, at first, civil lawyers could carry out their functions and defend prisoners. This situation deteriorated progressively and they were confronted with obstacles in the exercise of their profession, especially as regards being able to communicate with their clients. Subsequently, stated the complainants, lawyers were arrested and accused, for example, of complicit with the prisoners; others had been threatened and had left the country. Those who were released could no longer exercise their professional activities. As for the detained workers, they were informed, often after a lengthy imprisonment, that they must choose a lawyer within  hours. Having no contact with the outside they were obliged to accept a lawyer appointed on their behalf so that the trial was not delayed further. In this connection, a representative of the complainant organisation at the Committee's sittings of  and  May , who was arrested in  and again in , described his personal case and the torture to which he had been subjected. He added that all prisoners were tortured.
.Other allegations referred to cases of ill-treatment suffered even recently by imprisoned trade unionists (Mr. Iguini). The Committee had expressed its strong disapproval of any vexations or brutality inflicted on any prisoners and had pointed out to the Government the importance which it attached to all measures being taken, including the giving of specific instructions and the imposition of exemplary penalties in order to guarantee that no person detained was subject to ill-treatment.
.In these circumstances the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee, once again expressed its concern at the slowness of the judicial procedures in the cases of numerous trade unionists who were still detained and requested the Government to transmit a copy of the judgements, together with the grounds adduced therefor, which had been handed down concerning a number of trade unionists whose names were mentioned. The Governing Body also requested the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations relating to ill-treatment and to obstacles to the rights of defence, and to provide detailed information on the trade unionists whose names and trade union activities had been indicated by the complainants.
.In a communication of  May  the Government announced the release of Mr. Ricardo Vilaro Sanguinetti, an official of the National Workers' Convention (CNT). The Governing Body had already noted this information at its session on  and  June .
.The Government also conveys, in its communication of  October , information on many of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants at the last session of the Committee. The Government requests that the complainant organisations should be asked to furnish more detailed allegations. It considers that unfounded and improbable accusations are often made, as can be seen from the case in point. It stresses that, out of  persons alleged by the complainants to have been arrested, to have disappeared or to have died in prison,  are in prison,  have been released, another (Sal Faccio) to have died of injuries sustained while he was trying to escape by jumping from a moving truck, and  in respect of whom the authorities were in possession of no relevant records or any information or complaints to give grounds for assuming that they had disappeared. In its further communication dated  October  the Government transmits new information about  of the persons whose names had been sent to it. Twelve of those have been freed, in some cases some time ago. The Government also transmits the post mortem report on Hugo Pereyra Cunha who had been charged on account of subversive activities and who died on  March . According to this report, death was caused by a blood clot in the left ventricle followed by a haemorrhage.
.The Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees finally alleges, in a telegram of  October , that Adolfo Drescher, a trade union official in the banking sector, was arrested in early October by the naval forces on account of his trade union activities.
.Shortly before the meeting of the Committee the Government communicated the full text of the draft Bill on trade unions prepared by the working party of experts and information on the situation of the joint Committees. In this connection the Government states that  are functioning and  are being established and will start to function in the near future.
.The Committee has taken note of the draft law on occupational associations. Because this text was communicated at such a late date ( November ) the Committee has not been able to examine it in substance at its present session. The Committee notes with interest, however, that the draft law envisages the possibility of setting up organisations of first, second and third degree although the guidelines examined by the Committee at its last session made no mention of the right to set up federations and Confederations. On the other hand, the Committee notes with regret that the obligation on trade union leaders to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" has been maintained in the draft law. This, the Committee had indicated, could give rise to abuses in the absence of precise criteria on which a decision of the courts could be based in the event of a trade union leader being accused of failing to make the declaration. The Committee intends to make a detailed examination of the draft law at its next session.
.The Committee also notes",0,1973,Uruguay
75,"that the number of joint Committees in operation has noticeably increased since its last session. The Committee would repeat that these bodies should, in no case, substitute for trade union organisations and that workers' representatives on them should be freely elected without it being possible for them to be prevented from being elected because of their previous trade union activity. These bodies should, as in other countries, have a useful role to play in industrial relations but, in the present trade union situation in the country, should only be seen as a transitional measure until a legal way can be found - and this should be in the near future - for workers to be represented by trade unions. With this proviso, the Committee expresses the hope that the joint Committees which are being established will become operational in the very near future and that the Government will continue to provide information on the evolution of the situation as regards these Committees.
.The Committee notes, in addition, the information supplied by the Government concerning the numerous trade unionists who were detained. According to this information a certain number have been released. It takes note of the fact that, according to the Government's communication dated  October , certain accusations are unfounded, since the authorities possess no relevant records, in particular as regards  persons whose names are cited by the complainants; no requests for an inquiry into their disappearance have been lodged with the competent national authorities. Generally speaking, the Committee considers that allegations relating to the arrest or presumed disappearance of trade unionists should as far as possible be based on precise information (trade union membership and/or functions, place of residence, date and circumstances of the arrest or disappearance, etc.) in order to make it easier to obtain information on the situation of the persons mentioned. As regards the persons in respect of whom the Government states that it has no information the Committee is willing to resume examination of their cases if it is provided with more detailed information. As regards Hugo Pereira (Building workers' leader) who, according to certain allegations had died as a result of ill-treatment, the Committee would like the Government to indicate whether investigations have been made into the circumstances of his death, and the results of these investigations.
.The Government further limits itself - except in certain cases - to quoting sections of the ordinary or military penal codes under which trade unionists have been prosecuted or sentenced by military courts, that is to say it indicates the kind of acts committed, but it does not supply details of the specific offences with which they are charged in each case; nor has it communicated the texts of the judgements rendered in their cases, as requested by the Governing Body in a number of cases. The Committee wishes to recall that at an earlier stage of examination of this case the Government supplied information of this kind during a direct contacts mission. This absence of information makes it impossible for the Committee to determine whether the persons concerned were sentenced - often to long terms of imprisonment - for acts unconnected with their trade union membership or activities.
.Furthermore, although the number of prisoners who have been judged by the courts is increasing, many trade unionists are still awaiting trial; some of them have been doing so for long periods in this respect the Committee wishes once again to express its concern at the slowness of the judicial procedure. Furthermore, it notes that Mr. Hctor Enrique Altesor Hafliger is said to be still in prison after the decision to abandon legal proceedings against him.
.Finally, the Government has not replied to the new allegations concerning ill-treatment inflicted on prisoners in order to obtain confessions from them, and regarding the precarious nature of the right to defence (paragraphs  and ). Detailed replies on this vitally important aspect of the case would enable the Committee to ascertain whether the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are enjoying full guarantees as regards the conditions of their imprisonment and the right to defence. In this respect the Committee wishes to stress that the purpose of the entire procedure which has been instituted is to secure respect for freedom of association de jure as well as de facto; it is convinced that, while this procedure protects governments from unreasonable accusations, the latter should in turn recognise the importance for their own reputations of collaborating fully with the Committee - as the Uruguayan Government has done on many occasions during earlier stages of this case - in order to enable it to make a thorough investigation of the facts and to seek solutions to the problems which have arisen.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the forthcoming legislation on occupational associations:(i) to express its concern at the slowness in adopting legislation based on the principles of freedom of association;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government, in particular, to the fact that the obligation imposed on trade union leaders by the draft legislative decree on occupational associations to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"", could give rise to abuses, as stated in paragraph  above;(iii) to request the Government to indicate the date on which it envisages the adoption and application of the final text of the law;(b) as regards the joint Committees provided for under a Decree of , and subject to what is stated in paragraph  above to note that the number of these in operation has noticeably increased and to request the Government to continue to provide information on developments in the situation concerning these Committees;(c) as regards the arrested trade unionists:(i) to note the most recent information provided by the Government and that a certain number of these persons have been released;(ii) to regret, however, the absence of additional information from the Government on the precise allegations made against the trade unionists who have been prosecuted or sentenced (including copies of the judgements) and the absence of the observations of the Government on the allegations concerning ill-treatment of prisoners and obstruction of their right of defence;(iii) to request the Government to communicate detailed information on the situation of the trade unionists listed in the annex in respect of whom it has not yet supplied details, and on the investigations made in the cases of Hugo Pereyra (paragraph ) and on the present situation of Altesor Hafliger (who is said to have been kept in prison following the dismissal of the case by the courts);(d) to request the Government to transmit information and observations on the points mentioned in clauses (a), (b) and (c), if possible by  January at the latest; and(e) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.For the first time the Committee has invited the authorities of the country concerned and the complainant organisations to supply orally, in the course of one of its meetings, detailed information concerning the case. The representatives of the Minister of Labour and those of the WCL and the WFTU began by making a statement; thereafter they replied to questions put to them. The Committee wishes-to express its thanks to the representatives of the Government and to those of the complainant organisations for their co-operation. It considers that this procedure has proved useful. It wishes to stress, however, that this procedure is in no way designed to pronounce judgement against a government but that its purpose is to permit an exchange of views which may contribute to the ascertainment of the facts and to a greater respect for trade union rights.
.The exchanges of views dealt mainly with the guidelines of the draft law on occupational associations. The Committee considers that this document contains positive aspects such as the right of occupational associations to be constituted without prior authorisation. Certain basic ideas contained in the bill should however be made more precise taking account of the standards contained in the Conventions on freedom of association. Without making a detailed analysis at this stage of the guidelines, the Committee wishes to emphasise in particular the guarantees contained in Article  of Convention No. , namely that organisations of workers and employers should be able to establish and join federations and Confederations. It also considers that the obligation on trade union leaders of occupational associations to make a declaration, as provided in the Guidelines (paragraph ), ""to uphold democracy"" could lead to abuses since such a provision does not include any precise criteria on the basis of which a judicial decision could be taken if a trade union leader was accused of having disregarded the declaration.
.The Committee notes the statement that the bill will be finalised in the near future. It trusts that the bill will be drafted prior to its session in November  and that, as the Government previously promised, it will transmit a copy of the text so that the Committee may examine this.
.As regards the present situation, the",0,1973,Uruguay
76,"Committee has noted the slowness with which the joint Committees referred to in the decree of  February  have been set up. As the Committee has already pointed out, although it considers that these bodies cannot substitute for trade union organisations, they can play a useful role in the field of industrial relations. The workers representatives of these Committees should also be freely elected and they should not be able to be kept out of the Committees because of their past trade union activities. Furthermore, there should also be such Committees for the public sector.
.It also appears from the information communicated by the Government on the arrested trade unionists (mentioned in the annex to the th Report) that most of them are still awaiting trial; nevertheless a number of them have been judged and sentenced to terms of imprisonment (one has been released because he had completed his term taking account of the time spent under preventive detention). Others have been released (one acquitted for lack of evidence). There are a number of divergences between the latest information supplied by the Government and the information transmitted by it earlier.
.The Committee has noted once again with concern the slowness of the judicial procedure concerning detained trade unionists. It has noted for example that of the  persons to which paragraph  refers in particular  still await trial, in some cases for several years now, and only  have been provisionally released.
.Nevertheless certain trade unionists have been brought to trial and sentenced on account of subversive activities. The Committee wishes to receive in these cases a copy of the judgements together with the grounds adduced therefor which have been handed down concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph . In fact, as it previously recalled, in the present case it is for the Committee itself to decide on the basis of the information available, and above all the texts of the judgements, whether these trade unionists were sentenced for common law crimes or for trade union activities. It could be the case in fact that acts which are legitimate as regards the principles of freedom of association may be at any given time considered as illegal under national law or by the authorities whose duty it is to apply it.
.In addition, the Government has not provided sufficient details in reply to the serious allegation that Mr. Ricardo Vilaro has been again imprisoned by the armed forces immediately after being released by the courts. Moreover, the representatives of the WCL and the WFTU made statements concerning the conditions of detention as well as of the rights of defence and submitted lists of numerous persons, mainly trade union leaders, who are alleged to have been arrested or who have disappeared. The names of the persons in respect of whom the complainants have given details as to their trade union affiliation and their trade union activities or functions will be communicated to the Government.
.Finally, certain allegations referred to the ill treatment which detained trade unionists are said to have suffered even recently (case of Mr. Iguini). The Committee has in the present case already expressed its strong disapproval of any vexations or brutality inflicted on any prisoners. It has also pointed out to the Government the importance which it attaches to all measures being taken including the giving of specific instructions and the imposition of exemplary penalties in order to guarantee that no person detained is subject to ill treatment.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the legislation on occupational associations:(i) to request the Government to indicate the date on which it envisages the adoption and the bringing into force of the final text of the law;(ii) to note that according to the representatives of the Government the draft bill on trade unions will be completed in the near future and to express the hope that the Government will be able to communicate a copy thereof prior to the Committee's next session in November ;(b) as regards the joint Committees set up under a decree of :(i) to stress, as stated in paragraph , the importance of guaranteeing the free election of workers to these Committees;(ii) to request the Government to supply information on the evolution of the situation as regards these bodies;(c) as regards the arrested trade unionists:(i) to note the latest information communicated by the Government;(ii) to express once again its concern at the slowness of the judicial procedures in the cases of numerous trade unionists who are still detained;(iii) to request the Government to transmit a copy of the judgements, together with the grounds adduced therefor, which have been handed down concerning the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph ;(iv) to request the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations (mentioned in paragraphs  and ) relating to the ill-treatment suffered during detention as well as regarding the obstacles to the rights of defence and to provide detailed information on the specific case (mentioned in paragraph ) of Mr. Ricardo Vilaro, at the same time giving the reasons for his renewed detention;(v) to request the Government also to communicate detailed information on the trade unionists who appear on the lists submitted by the complainants which will be communicated to it in the near future;(d) to request the Government to transmit the information requested above not later than  October ;(e) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  May .

.At its session in November , the Committee had noted that the Government had referred once again to the subversive activities with which it had had to cope as an explanation for the exceptional measures taken, and had added that the process of normalisation of trade union activity had to be analysed within the wider concept of political and institutional normalisation within the country. The Committee wished to emphasise in this connection that although respect for freedom of association is closely bound up, as was stated by the International Labour Conference in , with respect for civil liberties in general, it is nevertheless important, with this reservation, to distinguish between the recognition of freedom of association and questions relating to a country's political evolution. The Committee had added that there should be no confusion between trade unions' performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers, and the possible pursuit by certain of their members of other activities having nothing to do with trade union functions. The penal responsibility which such persons may incur by such acts should in no way result in measures amounting to depriving the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action.
.The Committee had regretted that despite the time which had elapsed the trade union organisations were still encountering serious difficulties. In particular, the trade union legislation announced on several occasions still had not been adopted. The Government had pointed out, however, in a communication dated November  that the trade union question would be examined by it at the highest level as from  November . The Committee had taken note of this statement. It had recalled that, in November  already, the Governing Body had called the Government's attention, on the recommendation of the Committee, to the importance which it attached to the rapid adoption and application of trade union legislation in keeping with the provisions of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Uruguay, taking into account in particular the comments made by the Committee itself in a previous cases and by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The Committee had considered that the continuing existence of serious divergences between the Conventions on freedom of association on the one hand and legislation and national practice on the other was a matter for great concern. It considered it urgent that the Government permit a return to normal trade union activity and remove the related legal and factual restrictions. The adoption and implementation of new trade union legislation would undoubtedly constitute a decisive step in this direction.
.The Committee had noted the information provided by the Government regarding the detention of certain trade unionists. With particular reference to the persons whom the Director-General's representative was able to see and whose files he was able to examine during his last visit to Uruguay, no judgement had been rendered since that mission, although many of the persons in question had been imprisoned for many months, if not years. The Committee had recalled that the Director-General's representative had already noted, during his first visit to Uruguay, that initial inquiries and investigations were slow moving. The Committee could only express its concern in view of the continuing existence of such a situation. It had considered that although the fact of exercising trade union activity or holding trade union office does not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the prolonged detention of trade unionists without them being promptly tried can constitute a serious handicap to the",0,1973,Uruguay
77,"exercise of trade union rights.
.In view of all these circumstances, the Committee had recommended the Governing Body, inter alia:(a) to regret that despite the time which had elapsed, the trade union organisations were still encountering serious difficulties and that the new trade union legislation announced on several occasions had still not been enacted;(b) to note, however, with interest the Government's statement contained in a recent communication that the trade union question would soon be examined by the Government at the highest level;(c) to urge the Government to permit a rapid return to normal trade union life and adopt for this purpose legislation respecting the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay;(d) regarding the detention of trade unionists:(i) to note the information communicated by the Government, but state its concern at the slowness of court procedure and the fact that no judgement had been pronounced since the last visit of the Director-General's representative, regarding, in particular, persons who had not yet been brought to trial, whom the Director-General's representative had been able to see or whose files he had been able to examine during his second mission in Uruguay;(ii) to call the Government's attention to the considerations set out regarding the detention of trade unionists and to request it to transmit the texts of the judgements and the grounds adduced therefor in respect of the trade unionists mentioned in subparagraph (i) who had not yet been brought to trial;(iii) regarding the persons mentioned in the Annex, in respect of whom the Government had asked for further information, to request the latter to continue its search for information on their situation and to invite the complainants to supply any additional information which they might possess in this connection;(iv) regarding the persons mentioned in the Annex, in respect of whom the Government had not yet transmitted information, to request it to communicate this information as soon as possible;(e) to request the Government to submit by  February  at the latest information on the evolution of the trade union situation, including the new legislation, and on the persons referred to in subparagraph (d).
.In its communication dated  December , the Government states that at its meeting at the highest level it decided ""to legislate in the near future, in the light of the experience acquired through the working of the joint Committees, on the status and functioning of occupational associations, defining their scope and precluding any politicisation"". The necessary steps have been taken to enable the study of such legislation to be started.
.In its communication dated  January  the Government provides information about the following persons mentioned by the Committee in its last report: Santana Coronel, Dario, released on  July ; Toledo Perlas, Pedro Hector, brought to trial on  February  under article () of the Military Penal Code before the military judge of the first instance (first chamber); Bentaberry Benitez, Eugenio, released in October ; prosecuted again on  February  under article () of the Military Penal Code; Cuesta Villa, Gerardo, brought to trial under article () and () in connection with article (), subparagraph , of the Military Penal Code before the military magistrate (fourth chamber); Marotta Rienzi, Antonio, brought to trial on  August  under article () of the Military Penal Code before the military magistrate (fourth chamber). The Government requests additional information concerning Soria, Carlos and Villalba. Finally, the Government states that, due to the fact that the courts were not in session during the annual January holiday, it was unable to request more information. Further details will be communicated as soon as possible.
.In a communication dated  February  the Government supplied a long list of detained persons who were released provisionally or unconditionally in . A certain number of persons provisionally released are trade unionists mentioned in several of the complaints.
.The Government also indicates in its communication of  February  that the Minister of Labour has been entrusted with the setting up of a Committee to draft a Bill concerning trade union organisations. The first responsibility of this Committee will be to draw up guidelines for this Bill, the draft of which will be transmitted to the ILO as well as to the representative organisations of workers and employers. The Government insists that it decided to legislate in the near future and that this task will accompany the institutional restructuring which the Government is determined to carry out. In this connection it was decided in August  that national elections will take place in November , and that measures for this purpose will be taken as from . It was also decided to accentuate government efforts to consolidate and accelerate the development of the economic and social sectors.
.The Committee takes note, first of all, of the decision taken by the Government at its highest level to legislate on the status and the functioning of occupational associations. A Committee has been appointed to draft the appropriate legislation. The Government insists that it has decided to legislate in the near future and transmit the draft trade union law to the ILO. It appears, however, that the outcome of this task will depend on developments concerning the institutional restructuring of the country.
.The Committee also notes all the information supplied by the Government regarding the detention of trade unionists. This latest information shows that a certain number of trade unionists have been provisionally released, that one has been released unconditionally and that court proceedings have been instituted against others. The Committee is obliged, however, to observe that the Government has not supplied information on the majority of the trade unionists mentioned in the previous report. In particular, no judgements have been pronounced in respect of the persons against whom proceedings have been instituted before the military tribunals. Finally, the Committee notes that the complainants have not forwarded additional information regarding some of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints as requested by the Committee.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the information provided by the Government concerning a certain number of trade unionists, mentioned by the complainants, who have been provisionally liberated, and concerning the decisions taken to prepare new trade union legislation;(b) to regret that the Government has sent no new information concerning the majority of the trade unionists mentioned in the Committee's last report and to express once again its concern at the slowness of the judicial proceedings as regards the numerous trade unionists who are still in detention;(c) to express also its concern at the delay with which the new trade union legislation, which has been announced on a number of previous occasions, and the preparation of which is only now to be undertaken, can be brought into force; to note the Government's promise that the draft trade union law will be transmitted to the ILO and to point out the importance which it attaches to this legislation being in conformity with the freedom of association Conventions ratified by Uruguay;(d) to request the Government to transmit, not later than  April , detailed information particularly concerning the trade unionists mentioned in the annex as well as concerning the progress made in the preparation of new trade union legislation;(e) in order to have more precise information regarding the situation, to invite the Minister of Labour, or if he cannot be available, his representative to supply orally to the Committee, at its meeting in May , detailed information on the evolution of the situation and on the prospects for a rapid return to a normal trade union situation;(f) to invite also the complainant organisations which have consultative status with the ILO to provide oral information at the next meeting of the Committee;(g) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, chairman.
.It should be recalled first of all that the conclusions submitted by the Committee in May  followed a second direct contacts mission to the country, from  to  April  by a representative of the Director-General.
.The Committee noted that there had been no change in the legal situation of trade unions since the representative of the Director-General carried out his first mission. Nevertheless, the factual situation had changed: there had been improvement in the situation of the unions affiliated to the General Confederation of Workers of Uruguay (CGTU) which had been able to perform certain internal activities (meetings, elections, etc.). On the other hand, the unions affiliated to the National Workers' Convention (CNT), which had been dissolved by the Government after the change of regime in , appeared to remain to a large extent inactive; many of their leaders were detained, had left the country, or had been dismissed. The premises of certain unions were under police control, closed, under surveillance, etc. As for industrial relations activities, the extent of recognition of the unions of the CGTU and their leaders depended on whether or not they were on good terms with the employers or the heads of their public administrative services. On",0,1973,Uruguay
78,"the contrary, the unions affiliated to the CNT did not appear to be recognised in either the private or the public sectors.
.The Government had once again indicated its concern for a return to a normal trade union situation. According to the Government, the delay in adopting new trade union legislation was due to the discovery of certain subversive activities in preparation, including the storage of arms (in which several trade unionists had taken part), to the political crisis of  and to economic and political considerations. The Government considered that the trade union question was only part of the problem of the country's political institutions. Furthermore, the reduction of trade union activity and industrial peace had, according to it, contributed to certain economic progress being made it stated that it was preparing new trade union legislation, the main aspects of which were being studied, and it hoped that progress would be made during the year .
.The Committee recalled that the Government had previously invoked considerations of a political and economic nature during the first mission of the representative of the Director-General to explain the restrictions placed on trade unions and their activities. The Committee expressed its concern that these considerations continued to hinder the re-establishment of a normal trade union situation. The Government possessed various legal means to deal with the subversive activities of specific persons. As for the problem of the political institutions in the country and their future evolution, the Committee considered that the workers' and employers' organisations had their proper and specific functions to perform, their object being to defend the occupational interests of their members. The requirements of development should not justify maintaining the entire trade union movement of a country in a legally irregular situation, thereby preventing the workers from exercising their trade union rights, as well as preventing organisations from carrying out their normal activities. A balanced economic and social development requires the existence of strong and independent organisations which can participate in the process. The Committee noted, in this connection, that all the members of the Government interviewed by the Director-General's representative and also the employers took the view that it was essential to have as interlocutors trade unions which defend the occupational interests of their members.
.The Committee added that the Government authorities and the employers should refrain from any discrimination between trade union organisations, especially as regards recognition of their leaders seeking to perform legitimate trade union activities. It recalled that, on the one hand, workers and their organisations were bound to respect the law and that, on the other hand, the law of the land should not be such as to impair, nor should it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in Convention No. . In placing certain organisations at a disadvantage where these organisations were carrying out legitimate activities, a government could influence workers in the choice of the organisation to which they might wish to belong, and if this were done deliberately, it would infringe the standards contained in the Convention and in particular the principle that workers have the right to establish and join organisations o?their own choosing. In that connection the Committee noted, for example, that one trade union office remained closed although several persons who had taken part in illegal activities in that office were subsequently released by the military judge, that other offices remained guarded, closed, placed under supervision, etc. in spite of the time that had elapsed since the events which led to those measures, that no leader of any union affiliated to the CNT was recognised in practice either by the authorities or by the employers, that some of those leaders had been detained on a number of occasions for carrying out activities of a trade union nature and that all or several members of executive Committees of unions had been dismissed.
.The Committee noted that the joint Committees set up by decree of  February  had not started to function in practice (whilst the elected members of a similar joint Committee, in the FUNSA undertaking, had taken over their functions). According to the Government, those Committees should be considered as representing a stage in the process of promulgating trade union legislation. While the Committee considered that those Committees could not replace trade union organisations, it was also of the view that the workers' representatives on those bodies should be freely elected and should not be liable to be dismissed from them unless they had committed an offence or carried out an illegal activity that would be prejudicial to the proper exercise of their functions as members of those Committees.
.Regarding the detention of trade unionists, the Committee noted, in particular, that according to the report of the Director-General's representative, there had been a decrease in the number of those detained on account of acts linked with trade union activities. The report also contained detailed information on the specific facts for which the remaining detained trade unionists, which he had been able to see, stood accused, or whose files he had been able to examine. These persons were: Bentaberry Benitez, Eugenio; Cayotta Zappettini, Victor Eugenio; Coitiho Cebey, Carlos Dioniso; Cuesta Villa Gerardo; Delgado Larrosa, Freddy; Fassano Martens, Carlos Ignacio; Genovese Cortazar, Omar Isaac; Gershuni Prez, Jaime; Gonzalez Cardozo, Jorge Ral; Gidotti Luscher, Luis; Iguini Ferreira, Luis Alberto; Marotta Rienzi, Antonio; Ormaechea de Len, Juan Jose; Prez Baccino, Didasko; Rezzano, Alicia Maria; Rodriguez da Silva, Hector Pio; Rubio Bruno, Enrique Vicente; Turiansky, Vladimir Ilitch; Via, Beltram Pablo Camilo. The Committee noted that some of these persons had been arrested in connection with matters which could be considered as being linked to trade union activities. In the remaining cases, the information gathered, although incomplete, gave the impression that the criminal procedures set in motion by the authorities were aimed first of all at activities of a political character considered by the Government to endanger security and public order. The Director-General's representative pointed out, however, that some of the charges were linked to the activities of the CNT, which had been dissolved by the Government in .
.The Committee noted the information provided in the report, on the allegations of ill-treatment of detained trade unionists. In particular, the information related to specific cases, which came to his attention, of brutality inflicted on prisoners who were subsequently accused of crimes of subversive association or giving assistance to subversive bodies. Moreover, the report continued, it could not be affirmed that these practices were systematic. According to the authorities, there were cases where officials were censured for such acts and, in the case of one prisoner who died, the guard responsible was prosecuted for culpable homicide.
.The Committee expressed its strong disapproval of any vexations or brutality inflicted on any prisoner, and called attention to the importance which it has always attached to the fact that trade unionists, like any other persons, are entitled to the guarantees of normal judicial procedure in accordance with the principles contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee had already referred to the question of ill-treatment in its rd Report, following the first visit of the Director-General's representative it insisted again that the Government take all the necessary steps, including not only specific instructions, but also the imposition of exemplary penalties, in order to guarantee that no person detained was subjected to ill-treatment. The Committee noted that, as indicated by the Director-General's representative, the authorities were making efforts to instruct the police in methods to ensure better treatment for persons during interrogation and at all other times.
.Consequently, the Governing Body had decided, on the Committee's recommendation:(a) regarding the trade union situation, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set out in paragraphs  and , to urge it to proceed without delay to the restoration of a normal situation and to adopt, for this purpose, legislation which would be in conformity with the Conventions ratified by Uruguay;(b) regarding the joint Committees, subject to the considerations expressed in paragraph , to point out that it is important to ensure the free election of workers' representatives in those Committees;(c) regarding the detention of trade unionists, to note the information obtained from the Government by the representative of the Director-General on the acts of which the persons detained stood accused, and which, according to the Government, were linked to activities of a political character; to note also that several trade unionists who were being prosecuted had been released by the courts;(d) to point out, however, the importance of no person being detained on account of his trade union activities and to request the Government to transmit, as soon as they were available, the texts of the judgements and the grounds adduced therefor, that are rendered in the cases of persons not already tried, referred to in paragraph ;(e) to note that there had again been several cases of brutality inflicted on prisoners: to note also the statement by the Government that efforts were being made to instruct the",0,1973,Uruguay
79,"police in methods to ensure better treatment for detainees; to recall the importance it attached to the Government taking all the necessary steps, including not only specific instructions, but also the imposition of exemplary penalties, to guarantee that no person detained was subject to ill-treatment;(f) to decide, taking account of the information provided by the representative of the Director-General, that it would not be appropriate at that stage to establish a Commission of inquiry in connection with the complaint presented under article  of the Constitution;(g) to request the Government to transmit information on the development of the situation and on the trade union legislation.
.The International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Associations reported in its communications the arrest of Julio Garcia and Pedro Aldrovandi, trade union leaders in the milk and sugar industries, respectively. According to the complainants, the latter, who was admitted to hospital a short while ago for a hemiplegia, was arrested in Montevideo at the beginning of June, then transferred to the department of Salto. The Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers stated that reprisals had been taken against leaders and militants of its affiliated organisation, the Glass Workers' Federation of Montevideo. It gave the names of several persons who had already been mentioned in preceding complaints, and those of Oscar Rodriguez, Celestino Lopez and Julio Santos, works delegates. The Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers' Trade Unions: international reported the arrest and disappearance since the beginning of July  of Juan Angel Toledo, secretary of the Textile Workers' Congress and member of the administrative Committee of the complainant organisation.
.The Government provided information or observations in its various communications on many persons regarding whom information had been requested from it in recent or older complaints. This information is summarised in the annex. In particular, it provided information on the state of progress of the court action undertaken against the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph , with the exception of Jorge Raul Gonzlez Cardozo; no sentence has been pronounced since the visit of the Director-General's representative.
.The Government also recalled its earlier statements concerning the normalisation of occupational relations in accordance with the various items mentioned in its communication of  October . It stated that it was devoting itself to the restructuration of the country's institutions and referred again to the moral vacuum, ideological infiltration and armed attack with which it had to deal and which constituted the reasons for the exceptional measures taken to protect the State and the country's historical continuity. Normalisation in occupational organisations, therefore, formed part, accordingly, of a wider context and, in order to be understood, the measures taken by the Government had to be analysed within the general framework of the political and institutional normalisation announced.
.As part of these measures, continued the Government, reference should be made to the Decree of  February  setting up joint Committees at the level of private undertakings. Section  of that Decree was subsequently modified by the Decree of  August  enabling the competent authorities to set up such Committees whenever they, think it appropriate in the public interest, in undertakings in which they had not been set up spontaneously. The Government's intention was that these Committees should serve as a stimulus for formation of the leadership necessary as part of the system required for the normalisation referred to. However, it continued, there also existed, as pointed out in the report of the Director-General's representative, an important trade union core which was at present operating correctly, performing its normal activities.
.The Government added that two facts confirmed its stated line of action:(a) Act No. . of  July  and its enabling Decree No. / of  January  re-establish a Conventional sickness insurance system. This legislation provides for participation machinery with bipartite administration. Workers can express their desires through elections by secret ballot;(b) a decree is to be passed shortly, setting up a bipartite consultative Committee for the merchant navy, which embodies the principles contained in the Placing of Seamen Convention,  (No. ). According to the Government, these two facts demonstrated its desire to adopt measures permitting the slow but sure regularisation of trade union organisations in the country.
.The Government added that it would keep the ILO fully informed of the measures taken in the future until trade union activity had finally been restored to normal. The measures already taken reflected the desire to give effect to the four basic principles guiding the building up of the new legislation in this field. The Government referred, amongst these, to the worker's recognised right to elect his representatives to serve on the various Committees referred to; the guarantee of a secret ballot, the occupational status of eligible workers, the consideration to be shown by these Committees for occupational problems, all of which showed serious and clear progress towards the new institutionalisation of occupational relations. The Government concluded that this should provide the best safeguard, since it was based not only on legislation, but also on practical experience within the country. The Government pointed out in its communication of  November  that the question of trade unions was on the agenda of the meeting it would hold at the highest level as from  November .
.In its latest communication of  November  the Government stated, in particular, that the extraordinary general meeting of the CGTU had recently taken place and that it had elected a new executive council at that meeting.
.The Committee takes note of the information supplied. The Government refers once again to the subversive activities with which it had to cope as an explanation for the exceptional measures taken and adds that the regularisation of trade union activity is to be analysed within the wider concept of political and institutional normalisation within the country. The Committee wishes to emphasise in this connection that although respect for freedom of association is closely bound up, as was stated by the International Labour Conference in , with respect for civil liberties in general, it is nevertheless important, with this reservation, to distinguish between the recognition of freedom of association and questions relating to a country's political evolution. Neither should there be confusion between trade unions' performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers, and the possible pursuit by certain of their members of other activities having nothing to do with trade union functions. The penal responsibility which such persons may incur by such acts should in no way result in measures amounting to depriving the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action.
.The Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed the trade union organisations are still encountering serious difficulties. In particular, the trade union legislation announced on several occasions still has not been adopted. The Government points out, however, in its latest communication that the trade union question will be examined by it at the highest level as from  November . The Committee takes note of this statement. It recalls that, in November  already, the Governing Body had called the Government's attention, on the recommendation of the Committee, to the importance which it attached to the rapid adoption and application of trade union legislation in keeping with the provisions of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Uruguay, taking into account in particular the comments made by the Committee itself in a previous case and by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The Committee considers that the continuing existence of serious divergences between the Conventions on freedom of association on the one hand and legislation and national practice on the other is a matter for great concern. It considers it urgent that the Government permit a return to normal trade union activity and remove the related legal and factual restrictions. The adoption and implementation of new trade union legislation would undoubtedly constitute a decisive step in this direction.
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government regarding the detention of certain trade unionists. With particular reference to the persons whom the Director-General's representative was able to see and whose files he was able to examine during his last visit to Uruguay, no judgement has been rendered since that mission, although many of the persons in question have been imprisoned for many months, if not years. The Committee recalls that the Director-General's representative already noted, during his first visit to Uruguay, that initial inquiries and investigations were slow-moving. The Committee can but express its concern in view of the continuing existence of such a situation. It considers that although the fact of exercising trade union activity or holding trade union office does not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the prolonged detention of trade unionists without them being promptly tried can constitute a serious handicap to the exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret that despite the time which has elapsed, the",0,1973,Uruguay
80,"trade union organisations are still encountering serious difficulties and that the new trade union legislation announced on several occasions still has not been enacted;(b) to note, however, with interest the Government's statement contained in a recent communication that the trade union question will soon be examined by the Government at the highest level:(c) to urge the Government to permit a rapid return to normal trade union life and to adopt for this purpose legislation respecting the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay;(d) regarding the detention of trade unionists:(i) to note the information communicated by the Government, but state its concern for the slowness of court procedure and the fact that no judgement has been pronounced since the last visit of the Director-General's representative, regarding, in particular, the persons who have not yet been tried, mentioned in paragraph ;(ii) to call the Government's attention to the considerations set out in paragraph  and to request it to transmit the texts of the judgements and the grounds adduced therefor in respect of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph , who have not yet been brought to trial, especially as regards those who have been in detention for a number o?years;(iii) regarding the persons, mentioned in the Annex, in respect of whom the Government has asked for further information, to request the latter to continue its search for information on their situation and to invite the complainants to supply any additional information which they may possess in this connection;(iv) regarding the persons, mentioned in the Annex, in respect of whom the Government has not yet transmitted information, to request it to communicate this information as soon as possible;(e) to request the Government to submit by I February  at the latest information on the evolution of the trade union situation, including the new legislation, and on the persons referred to in subparagraph (d);(f) to take note, in the meantime, of the present interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The last time the Committee considered these cases was at its meeting in November , when it submitted a report on them (rd Report, paragraphs  to ). This report was adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session in November .
.After analysing the information available to it through the direct contacts procedure used in these cases, the Committee took the view that, in view of the nature of the case it would be appropriate and desirable for it to continue to follow developments in the trade union situation in Uruguay, and the effect given to its own recommendations, in accordance with the procedure in force. It accordingly recommended the Governing Body to invite the Government to submit full information before the Governing Body's Session in February  with regard to the action already taken or contemplated with a view to complying with the Committee's recommendations, and to forward its observations on the questions and allegations still outstanding.
.The Government sent two communications dated  January  in answer to this request, and in response to new complaints made by various complainant organisations.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In view of all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret that, in spite of the statement made by the Minister of Labour in June , the Government has still taken no practical steps to restore the trade union situation to normal, so that the workers' occupational organisations and their members can benefit properly from the safeguards and fully exercise the rights set forth in the Conventions on freedom of association ratified by Uruguay;(b) to reaffirm the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , namely that ""workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority"";(c) while noting the release of several workers and trade unionists previously detained, to draw the Government's attention to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above and, in particular, to the danger involved for trade union rights when trade unionists are arrested and no grounds for conviction are subsequently found;(d) to take note of the information supplied by the Government about certain of the trade unionists detained, and to request the Government for the information still outstanding, and especially for the decisions taken with regard to the persons concerned, together with copies of the judgments rendered, with the reasons adduced;(e) to take note of the Government's statement concerning the allegations of ill-treatment, to reaffirm the importance of issuing specific instructions on the subject for the primary purpose of preventing any possible practices of this kind, and to request the Government for the information mentioned in paragraph  above;(f) to ask the Government for its detailed comments on the occupation and searching of trade union premises, referred to in paragraph  above;(g) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report once it has received the information requested.
.The Committee on Freedom of Association has been examining various complaints alleging breaches of trade union rights in Uruguay, presented by the World Federation of Trade Unions, the World Confederation of Labour, the Uruguayan National Workers' Convention, the Latin American Workers' Confederation, the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers, the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Public Services and Allied Occupations, the Trades Union International of Workers in the Metal Industries, the World Federation of Teachers' Unions, the Latin American Federation of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, the International Federation of Actors, the Uruguayan Medical Trade Union and the Montevideo Bus Company. Almost all these complaints are combined in Case No. , regarding which the Committee has submitted four interim reports to the Governing Body which appear in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, paragraphs  to  of its nd Report, paragraphs  to  of its th Report and paragraphs  to  of its th Report. These reports were approved by the Governing Body at its meetings of November , February-March , November  and March , respectively.
.In the latter of these reports, the Committee pointed out that it was confronted with a situation which raises important problems in relation to various basic principles of freedom of association and which seems to affect a large section of the trade union movement in Uruguay. The Committee also noted that new complaints were still being presented regarding the trade union situation in Uruguay and that the information supplied by the complainants and by the Government was largely contradictory. In these circumstances, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government's agreement, in accordance with the procedure for direct contacts previously adopted by the Committee in another country, for the appointment by the Director-General of a representative to examine, in Uruguay, the facts relating to the complaint and to report thereon to the Committee. This recommendation having been adopted by the Governing Body, the Uruguayan Government gave its consent in communications dated  and  May .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Philippe Cahier, Professor in the Institut universitaire de hautes tudes internationales in Geneva, who carried out his mission from  June to  July , accompanied by an official of the International Labour Office.
.The Committee studied the report presented by the Director-General's representative and noted, in particular, that he had received all the facilities necessary for the fulfilment of his mission in Uruguay and that he had been able to have many talks, especially with the authorities and with leaders of workers' and employers' organisations, including detained leaders. Before visiting the country, the Director-General's representative had interviews with Uruguayan governmental, employers' and workers' delegates attending the th Session of the International Labour Conference and with leaders of the National Workers' Convention living outside Uruguay.
.The Committee has examined the various complaints in the light of the report mentioned and wishes to state that the information obtained by the Director-General's representative has been a valuable help in its work.
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Under these conditions, and with respect to the case as a whole, the Committee presents the following recommendations to the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to restrictions on freedom of association, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which should be attached to the rapid adoption and application of trade union legislation in keeping with the provisions of Convention No. , taking into account in particular the comments made by the Committee itself and by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in respect of Decree No. , governing trade union activities;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to the",0,1973,Uruguay
81,"dissolution of the National Workers' Convention, the Single National Union of Workers in the Building and Allied Trades and the Federation of Secondary School Teachers, to point out to the Government that, in dissolving these organisations by decree or resolution, it failed to observe the provisions of Article  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Uruguay, and to stress the importance which it attaches to the respect of this standard;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or orders for arrest of trade union leaders and militants,(i) to note the release of the arrested trade unionists, mentioned in paragraph ;(ii) regarding Enrique Pastorino and Jos d'Elia, in view of the time which has elapsed since the events which gave rise to the warrants for arrest issued against them and taking into account the fact that the other CNT leaders who were arrested in application of the same provision have all been released, to request the Government to consider the possibility of cancelling this measure, and thus helping to solve the existing problems regarding freedom of association;(iii) as regards Mr. Vladimir Turiansky, to request the Government to be good enough to supply information concerning his situation in law and the measures taken in this connection.(iv) with regard to the trade unionists still under arrest or awaiting trial by military courts:- to reiterate the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are accused of offences of a political nature or under common law which the Government considers to have no bearing on their trade union functions or activities, the persons concerned should be tried as rapidly as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority;- to request the Government to notify it of the decision taken, or transmit the text of the judgments in respect of the trade unionists mentioned above in paragraph , indicating the grounds adduced therefor;- to request the Government to send information on the position of the trade unionists mentioned in paragraph ;(v) regarding the allegations of ill-treatment, even if cases of ill-treatment might have been exceptional, to draw the attention of the Government to the importance of taking all necessary measures, including specific instructions and effective sanctions, to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment;(d) with regard to the allegations concerning searches of trade union premises, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set out in paragraph , so that it may take the necessary measures to prevent possible abusive searches of trade union premises and bring about the return of impounded trade union property and the reopening of closed offices;(e) with regard to the allegations concerning anti-trade union discrimination, to draw attention to the principles and considerations set out in paragraphs  to , and to invite the Government to take appropriate measures in both the public and private sectors to ensure that there is no anti-trade union discrimination and, in particular, to give full application to the relevant provisions of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Uruguay;(f) to invite the Government, in accordance with the points mentioned in paragraph  above, to send complete information, before the February  meeting of the Committee, regarding the measures taken or planned to give effect to the recommendations made, and its observations on the outstanding questions and allegations;(g) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report for the next meeting of the Governing Body.
.As a result of complaints lodged by numerous trade union organisations, the Committee already considered this case at its sessions in November , February  and November  and on each occasion submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs - of its th Report, paragraphs - of its nd Report, and paragraphs - of its th Report, and were adopted by the Governing Body, respectively, at the latter's st Session (November ), nd Session (February-March ) and th Session (November ).
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Consequently, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to give its consent as soon as possible to the appointment of a representative by the Director-General to proceed to an examination in Uruguay of the facts relating to the complaints and to inform the Committee of the result of his mission.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.This case was last examined by the Committee at its session in February  when the Committee submitted an interim report to the Governing Body (see nd Report of the Committee, paras. -).
.By a communication dated  March , the World Federation of Trade Unions transmitted a document from the National Workers' Convention of Uruguay containing additional information relating to the complaints. By two communications dated  and  April , the World Federation of Trade Unions transmitted additional information concerning the complaints. In addition, fresh allegations were submitted by the Trade Union International of Workers in the Metal Industries in a telegram dated  April . Further information in connection with the complaints was supplied by the National Workers' Convention of Uruguay in communications dated , ,  and  March,  April,  July, and  and  August . In further communications dated  April , the Medical Association of Uruguay transmitted additional information concerning the case. By a communication dated May , the Workers' Organisation of the Omnibus transmitted fresh allegations relating to the case. In another communication, transmitted to the ILO by the United Nations on  June , the Medical Association of Uruguay submitted further information in connection with the complaints. The International Federation of Actors, in communications dated  June,  and  July , submitted allegations and information relating to the case. A communication from the Union of Metalworkers dated  February , and transmitted to the ILO by the United Nations on  July , contained further information in connection with the complaints. These communications were transmitted to the Government for observations.
.The Government transmitted certain observations on the complaints in a communication dated  June .
.Uruguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined this case (in February ), the Committee noted that the allegations which had been made dealt mainly with the arrest of trade union leaders and the dissolution by decree of the National Workers' Convention. In view of the nature of the allegations and information which have now been received, the Committee considers it appropriate to summarise the allegations already examined, as well as the Government's observations thereon, before proceeding to analyse the information and allegations submitted to it since the case was last before it.Allegations relating to the Arrest of Trade Unionists, the Dissolution of the National Workers' Convention and General Intervention in Trade Union Matters
.The complainants had stated that numerous arrests had taken place and gave the names of some of the persons detained, in particular, those of Antonio Tornayo, a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention and a representative of the Uruguayan workers at the th Session of the International Labour Conference, who was stated to have been arrested on his return from the Conference; Felix Diaz, another leading figure in the Convention; Mario Acosta, General Secretary of the Building Workers' Federation and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of Workers in the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries; Daniel Baldassari, General Secretary of the Petroleum Workers' Federation and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers; Dr. Manuel Liberoff, Treasurer of the Medical Association of Uruguay, and five other leading figures in that union: Juan J. Ormaechea, Nestor Figari, Alberto Casamayote, Sergio Assandri and Carlos Buscato; and Victor Brindisi, General Secretary of the Teachers' Federation, a regional delegate of the American Teachers' Federation and a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention.
.The WFTU alleged that  trade union leaders were being sought by the police, including Jos d'Elia, President, and Vladimir. Turiansky, Vice-President of the National Workers' Convention, and Enrique Pastorino, President of the WFTU in all, some l, workers had been arrested and threatened with trial by military, courts, according to the WFTU. The latter also provided a list of  arrested trade union leaders, while the WCL sent a list (which it describes as incomplete) of  persons arrested.
.In its communication dated  October , the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers stated that on  June  the authorities, with support from the armed forces, brutally broke up a strike by the oil workers, members of an affiliated trade union organisation, and placed the ANCAP refinery under military control. The headquarters of the trade union concerned had been closed and its meeting outlawed. Furthermore,",0,1973,Uruguay
82,"the President of that union, Jons Stneri, had been arrested and a warrant had been issued for the arrests of Daniel Baldassari, General Secretary, and of the Secretary-Treasurer. Moreover, the other Uruguayan affiliated organisation - the Glass Workers' Federation - had allegedly been prevented from exercising its normal activities.
.The World Federation of Teachers, in a communication dated  November , asserted that the Uruguayan Government was continuing its repression of unionised teachers. The premises of teachers' unions had been broken into, typewriters and mimeograph machines destroyed and documents and records confiscated. It also claimed that Victor Cayota, President of the Secondary School Teachers' Federation, had been imprisoned.
.In a communication dated  November , the World Confederation of Labour provided a list (stated to be incomplete) of trade union leaders in custody for nearly five months. Apart from certain leaders already referred to, the following were being held in the Army Ordnance and Services College: Roberto Olmos, General Secretary, Trade Union of Graphic Arts; Hector Betancourt, a leading figure in the Transport Federation; Honorio Libner, a leader of the National Workers' Convention and Chairman of the National Federation of Municipal Employees; Aparicio Guzmn, a leader of the Trade Union of Graphic Arts; and Rubn Villaverde, a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention and the Federation of State Water Board Workers. The complainants also alleged that many workers were still locked up in barracks, the Montevideo police headquarters and local police stations and in the ""Cilindro Municipal"" Sports Stadium; some of their names are given. None of these persons had been sentenced or even brought to trial and, state the complainants, their only offence was to have defended the Constitution and freedom of association.
.In a communication dated  December , the Latin American Federation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries claimed that its affiliate in Uruguay, the National Union of Building and Allied Trades Workers, had had its headquarters forcibly occupied by troops, its funds had been confiscated and its meetings prohibited.
.The WFTU, the WCL and the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials industries further complained that the National Workers' Convention had been dissolved by decree. The decree in question, which was issued on  June , gave as the reason for dissolution the attitude of the leaders of the Convention, who were said to have encouraged and defended the use of violence and urged workers to occupy their workplaces; thereby obstructing public services and supplies.
.In a communication received by the ILO on  November , the Government replied by giving a general outline of the circumstances which, it stated, led to the arrest of the trade union leaders in question and the dissolution of the National Workers' Convention. In support of its comments, it transmitted an order approved by the Government on  June , dissolving the Convention, ordering its assets to be attached and its leaders to be arrested.
.In the above-mentioned communication, the Government began by declaring that it had for some considerable time been making every effort to devise a solution for the country's problems which, while offering the advantages of equity, would be in the best interests of the workers themselves. To this end it had held numerous direct talks with the various branches of the labour force, patiently encouraged constructive discussions among all Uruguayan organisations of employers and workers, proposed the creation of joint advisory Committees and suggested improvements in wages and working conditions. Many trade union organisations, and the vast majority of Uruguayan workers, had been very favourably impressed by these activities and the motives behind them.
.However, the Government continued, the National Workers' Convention, led by totalitarian extremists from minority groups, had opposed the Government's policy. It refused recognition of the right to work, championed violence, promoted the unlawful occupation of workplaces, both public and private, called for sabotage, encouraged continuous and very serious street disturbances, did its best to stop the flow of supplies to the people and tried to paralyse public services - indeed, work of any kind anywhere. What was at stake, in the Government's view, went considerably further than the success or failure of a strike. What was at issue was the success or failure of certain fanatically anti-democratic minority groups which had pushed the National Workers' Convention into the action described as a means of producing social chaos and a change in the political, economic and social life of the nation. Such opposition, the Government stated, could not possibly be justified by the defence of trade union interests of any kind; rather, it was prompted by ulterior motives of a notoriously political type, the prime aim being to destroy current institutions.
.The Government stated that recourse to violence cannot be admitted in any organised society and must be utterly and vigorously condemned. In this connection it noted that article () of the Uruguayan Constitution requires suspension of citizenship where a national belongs to political or social organisations which attempt to destroy the foundations of the national community either by violence or by propaganda advocating violence.
.The Government recalled further that article  of the Uruguayan Constitution entitles any persons to associate for any purpose provided the association be not unlawful. Act No.  (of  July ) defines an unlawful association as one which advocates violence against the institutions of the Republic or against the civil authorities. Section  of that Act provides for such an association to be dissolved and its leaders and members charged under the criminal law.
.These provisions, the Government added, clearly show that the National Workers' Convention had become an unlawful association in the above sense. Its activities could, under the Criminal Code, constitute rebellion, riotous assembly, public incitement to break the law and commit criminal acts, promotion of class hatred and contempt of the public authorities. It was for the criminal courts to define the offences and the criminal responsibility of the members and officers of the organisation.
.The Government's conduct in the present case was, it stated, justified in that, under the Constitution, it was responsible for keeping the peace and for taking prompt and vigorous action in the event of grave and unforeseen disturbance (article ,  and ). Moreover, section  of Act No.  (of  July ) empowers the Government to suspend meetings or activities in all premises, public or private, when such meetings or activities caused, or might cause, a breach of the peace. In view of this overriding duty to keep the peace, it was only natural that the Government should act by dissolving the National Workers' Convention and order the arrest and trial of its leaders by the competent criminal court.
.The Government, moreover, took the view that the allegations of infringement of ILO Conventions Nos.  and  could not be sustained. While Convention No.  does require the authorities to ""refrain from any interference which would restrict"" the rights of organisations or hamper the legitimate exercise of those rights, it does, on the other hand, lay down that ""in exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their respective organisations ... shall respect the law of the land"". The National Workers' Convention, however, had taken the view that its independence and freedom of action were such that it could with impunity overlook the law of the land and even attempt to overturn or destroy it. It ignored that defence of occupational interests for which trade unions exist in order to uphold certain political interests.
.Certainly, the Government continued, in any democratic society it was inevitable that the trade union movement be influenced by political parties. But it was essential to avoid a state of affairs in which the movement was used as a tool by some ideology or political faction and took decisions which did not unequivocally reflect the will of those who have freely come together in the defence of their interests.
.The points made in respect of the National Workers' Convention, The Government considered, could also be applied to the complaints from the Medical Association of Uruguay and the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Industries (concerning ANCAP, the state refinery). Lastly, it affirmed that the Government continued to abide by Conventions Nos.  and .
.The Governmental Order dated  June , attached to the Government's letter to the ILO, declares the National Workers' Convention to be an unlawful association and decrees its dissolution. Its premises were closed and its assets confiscated; bank deposits in its name or in that of its officers were frozen. These latter were to be placed under arrest and members and officers who had carried out acts presumed to be unlawful would be tried by the competent criminal court.
.In a further communication, dated  January , the Government stated that the imprisonment of Antonio Tamayo and the searches carried out for Enrique Pastorino were in no way related to their holding of union office. The Government stated that the arrest of Antonio Tamayo was ordered by the Executive",0,1973,Uruguay
83,"authorities pursuant to the declaration of a state of emergency (article () of the Constitution), and it was because he was presumed to have engaged in subversive activities harmful to the security of the State that Enrique Pastorino was being sought. In a more recent communication, dated  January , the Government stated that Mr. Tamayo had been set free at the end of December .
.With regard to the arrest of trade union leaders, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, took note of the Government's statement that Antonio Tamayo was set free in December , and drew the attention of the Government, in particular, to the principle that whenever trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions or activities, they should be given a prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal. The Governing Body also requested the Government to state whether proceedings had been instituted against all of these trade unionists and, if so, to provide details concerning the nature of the court dealing with the case and the stage the proceedings had reached, and to supply copies of the judgments, once they had been rendered, with the grounds adduced therefor.
.With regard to the dissolution of the National Workers' Convention, the Governing Body drew the attention of the Government to the importance it attaches to the principle that workers' organisations should not be subject to dissolution by administrative authority, and that likewise dissolution by the executive branch of the Government does not ensure the right of defence which normal judicial procedure alone can guarantee. The Governing Body also requested the Government for its observations on the alleged ban on activities by the Glass Workers' Federation and National Union of Workers of the Building and Allied Trades and on the measures taken against several teachers' organisations. In addition, the Governing Body requested the Government to send precise information on the nature of the acts of which Enrique Pastorino was accused.Further Allegations relating to the Arrest of Trade Unionists and General Intervention in Trade Union Matters
.In the communication from the National Workers' Convention, transmitted by the WFTU on  March , it is alleged that Sonia Guarnieri, leader of the Federation of Public Health Officials, was arrested in Brazil in September  and later handed over to the police of the Rivera area. She was then taken to Montevideo where she was tortured at police headquarters. The complainants state that this person had been sought by the police when the capture of the CNT leaders was ordered. She was arrested and kept in custody for over a month. According to the complainants, this person was imprisoned at the Eleventh Commissariat of Montevideo along with a number of other women trade unionists (including three from the Central Council for Family Allowances, leaders of the AFAF Union).
.Since  January , continue the complainants, Leon Duarte, Secretary of the Uruguayan Tyre Factory Union (FUNSA) has been held at the Military School, Rogelio Zorrn, a leader of the CNT and of the AUTE (Electricity and Telephone Workers) is being held in the premises of the Marine. The complainants supply a list of approximately forty trade unionists and their respective unions, who have been held at the stadium known as ""Cilindro Municipal"" since January or February . According to the complainants, the AUTE members, Luis Micheline Olivera and Heber Alonso, were tortured by the police and the latter had been taken from the ""Cilindro"" to a military prison.
.The complainants add that, on  February , the rgime published a document in which the names and photographs of the wanted trade union leaders were given. These included the entire Executive of the CNT. This document, state the complainants, was added to the normal editions of various newspapers.
.The WFTU, in its communication of  April , states that, according to the newspaper ""El Dial ( March ), the Secretariat of the Chief of Police of Montevideo, Colonel Alberto Ballestrino, issued an official communication suspending all authorisations for the holding of trade union meetings. The complainants continue that, on  March , the same newspaper published official Communication No.  of the Chief of the Montevideo Police, stating that ""applications for permission to hold trade union meetings must continue to be substantiated as in the past. After the applications have been considered, it will be decided in each specific case whether or not to grant permission to hold a meeting in accordance with the regulations in force"". The complainants allege that these two communications point clearly to the flagrant violation of the right of assembly of trade unions. Unions must, before holding a meeting, apply to the Chief of Police and to the Ministry of the Interior for permission to do so, and indicate the date, place and object of the meeting.
.In its communication of  April , the WFTU adds that, on  March , the offices of the National Union of Metallurgical and Allied Industries (UNTMRA), Montevideo, were occupied by the police and nine workers, who happened to be there, were arrested. On  March, the complainants continue, the offices of the Wool Workers' Federation were occupied and thirty-eight workers arrested. The Director of this Federation, state the complainants, comrade Freire Pizzano, was badly beaten up. On  March, the offices of the Consolidated Sea Transport Workers' Union were searched and nine workers arrested. Furthermore, state the complainants, Professor J. Bouton, leader of the medical Association, has been imprisoned after being under house arrest. No explanation has been given, add the complainants, for this action, nor is the present situation of Professor Bouton known.
.In a further communication dated  April , the Trade Union International of Workers in the Metal Industries states that several leaders of its affiliate, the National Union of Metallurgical and Allied Workers (UNTMRA), have been arrested on account of their trade union activities.
.The National Workers' Convention of Uruguay (CNT), in a communication dated  March , refers to a number of arbitrary acts carried out by the military rgime, including the dissolution by decree of the Convention, forcible entry into the premises of many trade unions, the issue of warrants for the arrest of all the leaders of the Convention, the prohibition of the check-off of trade union dues, dismissal of workers on account of trade union activities and imprisonment of anyone collecting union dues. In a communication dated  March , the CNT alleges generally that freedom of association and human rights are being completely ignored in Uruguay. In a further communication dated  March, the CNT refers to the forcible entry into the premises of the National Union of Metallurgical and Allied Workers, the Union of Woolworkers and the Sea Transport Workers' Federation in March  and the arrests which accompanied these actions. The complainants add that these three unions were involved in strictly trade union matters. Intervention by the police and armed forces in trade union affairs, state the complainants, has been a frequent occurrence since the coup d'tat of June . In many cases, trade union property has been damaged, stolen or confiscated. The CNT further alleges, in a communication dated  March , that on  March the premises of the Textile Workers' Union were broken into. In addition, state the complainants, all trade union programmes on the country's radio stations have been banned.
.In a communication dated may , the Workers' Organisation of the Omnibus allege that Antonio Tamayo, after his release from prison in December , resumed his trade union activities with the Transport Workers' Organisation and as workers' delegate-general to the Productivity, Prices and Incomes Commission, a tripartite organisation. The complainants state that, after a brief period of activity, Tamayo, along with forty-eight trade union and social militants, was dismissed by the ""Compaia Uruguaya de Transporte Colectivo SA (CUTCSA)"".
.The Medical Association of Uruguay, in a communication dated  May , alleges that Doctor Barret Diaz, General Secretary of the Association, has been detained since  May for no reason and without being brought to trial.
.In communications dated  June and  July , the International Federation of Actors allege that their Vice-President, and Secretary of the Uruguayan Actors' Union, Eduardo Prous, has been arrested. In a later communication, of  July , the complainants state that Mr. Prous has been released, although it is not yet known whether he would be able to pursue his activities in Uruguay.
.In communications dated  July and  August , the National Workers' Convention stresses that trade union activity has been totally suppressed and refers to the plight of detained trade unionists who are subjected to torture. In particular, the complainants state that, in a recent written communication, the Chief of Police notified the Union of Bank Employees (AEBU) that if it continued to pursue its activities and make claims, its headquarters would be closed. In another communication, dated  August , the CNT points out that, in August, four trade union",0,1973,Uruguay
84,"leaders of the dockers' union disappeared, viz. Juan Gmez, Rubn Bello, Agustin Tapia and Humberto de los Santos, and no information as to their situation is available.
.The Government, in a communication dated  June , transmits copies of communications between the Commissariat of Police, the National Director of Information and Intelligence and the Director-General for Executive Co-ordination, in which the following nine persons are stated as having been detained in the ""Cilindro Municipal"" and subsequently released: Victor Brindisi, Hctor Goi, Miguel Bouzas, Victor Cayota, Carlos Espinosa, Alberto Fernndez, Sonia Guarnieri, Jos Luis Cola Horne and Romula Oraison. One of the above persons, Sonia Guarnieri, is said to have been detained on  October , released on  November  and detained again on  February . She is stated to be still in custody. In addition, three other persons (viz. Ricardo Vilaro, A. Rubio and Hctor Rodriguez) are stated to have been taken to the Central Prison by order of the Military Judge. The persons named above are said to have been detained under the emergency security measures in their capacity as members of the National Workers' Convention, which was dissolved for having engaged in activities contrary to the national interest. The names are given of seven other trade union leaders (viz. Antonio Tamayo, Felix Diaz, Roberto Olmos, Hctor Betancourt, Honorio Lindner, Aparicio Guzman and Rubn Villaverde), who were temporarily detained for the same reasons, but who have all been released. The trade union leader, Hctor P. Rodriguez, along with two professors, is said to have been tried by the military authorities on charges of seditious activities, as a result of the investigations carried out in connection with the explosion of a bomb in the Faculty of Engineering.
.Having examined all the information transmitted to it, the Committee expresses its concern at the numerous and grave accusations of infringements of trade union rights made against the Government, and its regret that the Government has supplied no reply to many of the allegations made. The Committee has in the past emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments, for their part, should realise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.With regard to the arrest and detention of trade unionists, the Committee would again draw the attention of the Government to the principles to which it referred when it examined this case in February , viz. that of a prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions or activities. Whenever the Committee has come to the conclusion, in the light of the information available, that the accused have been fairly tried by a proper court, have had the benefit of a regular judicial procedure and have been condemned for acts having nothing to do with ordinary trade union activities, it has ruled that the case did not call for further consideration. It has, however, emphasised that the question as to whether such a matter is one relating to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned, but that it is for the Committee itself to decide on the point after an examination of all available evidence, especially the text of the judicial proceedings.
.The Committee would also point out, as it has done on previous occasions in the past, that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights. Governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.In addition to pointing out the above principles, which are applicable to the new allegations made against the Government since the Committee last examined the case, as well as to the allegations originally made by the complainants, the Committee is of the opinion that the allegations at its disposal bring into question the Government's observance of the main principles of the freedom of association Conventions which have been ratified by Uruguay. In particular, the new information made available to the Committee by the complainants, besides containing numerous and specific instances of arrest and detention of trade unionists, contains allegations of infringement of the right to hold trade union meetings, occupation of trade union premises (the Wool Workers' Federation, the National Union of Metal and Allied Workers, the Textile Workers' Union and the Sea Transport Workers' Federation), and dismissal of trade unionists on account of their trade union activities.
.The Committee, in view of the extent and gravity of the allegations made, recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to transmit, at an early date, full information on all the outstanding matters specified in the allegations formulated by the complainants, in particular concerning the arrest and detention of the named trade union leaders, indicating the precise reasons for their arrest and whether or not they have been brought to trial, as well as on the allegations of interference in trade union matters (right to hold trade union meetings, the forcible occupation of trade union premises, the alleged ban on the activities of the Glass Workers' Federation and the National Union of Workers of the Building and Allied Trades and on the measures taken against several teachers' organisations).
.In all these circumstances and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern at the extent and gravity of the allegations made and its regret that the Government has failed to supply sufficient information on many of the allegations made to enable the Committee to reach conclusions on the matters at issue in full knowledge of the facts;(b) to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments for their part should realise the importance, for the protection of their own good name, of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward;(c) in connection with the arrest and detention of trade unionists, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles contained in paragraphs  and  above, and to request it to supply full information concerning the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants, stating in particular the precise reasons for their arrest, whether proceedings have been instituted against these trade unionists and, if so, to indicate the results thereof;(d) to request the Government to transmit, at an early date, as full and precise information as possible concerning all the matters specified in the allegations formulated by the complainants (including the allegations of interference in trade union matters, right of assembly, forcible occupation of trade union premises, the ban on the activities of the Glass Workers' Federation and the National Union of Workers in the Building and Allied Trades and the measures taken against several teachers' organisations);(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report to the Governing Body when it has received the information requested from the Government.
.The Committee considered this e previously at it. - session in November , when it submitted an interim report on it to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ).
.In paragraph  of this report, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to forward its comments as soon as possible on the various allegations made against it.
.The comments of the Government were forwarded in three communications. The first was received on  November  and the other two are dated  and  January , respectively.
.In support of its complaint, the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers submitted further informatics in a communication dated  October . The World Federation of Teachers' Unions sent a fresh communication on  November  and the World Confederation of Labour did the same on the th of that month. The Latin American Federation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries made its complaint in a communication dated  December .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

85,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1973,Dominican Republic
86,".The complaint from the Confederation of Democratic Workers (CCTD) was submitted by a communication dated  August ; that of the Trade Union of Workers in the Electrical and Telecommunications Industries (SITET) by a letter dated  March . SITET presented additional information on  April . The Government submitted its comments by letters dated  November and  December .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The CCTD states that during the th Session of the International Labour Conference () the Workers' delegate of Costa Rica had accused his Government of trade union persecution and that the Government delegate had undertaken that his Government (including autonomous institutions) would not carry out any reprisals or persecution of any kind against trade union leaders. The complainants add that, disregarding this promise, the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (IOE), an autonomous body whose directors are appointed on government advice and in which there is a Minister appointed by the Central Government, had dismissed members of SITET and brought charges against Mr. Guido Nez Romn, Secretary-General of that union, accusing him of having used the right to strike, negotiated the signing of a collective agreement and exerted trade union pressure to that end.
.SITET states in its letter of  March  that since its registration with the competent administration it has been subjected to considerable pressure from the IOE. Investigations carried out by a special Committee of the Legislative Assembly had revealed that the accusation was justified. A Member of Parliament had then tabled a motion to the effect that the terms of a loan from the Inter-American Development Bank should include trade union immunity (fuero) and the obligation to negotiate a collective agreement. The IOE administrators had then undertaken to change their policy towards the union.
.In view of this commitment, the complainants continue, SITET had submitted a draft collective agreement in April , but one month later the Institute had transformed one of its own credit associations into a trade union called the ASDEICE and granted it all necessary privileges (furnished office, employee, car and driver, funds for the publication of a monthly bulletin, etc.). This ""home made"" union, continues the complainants, had also presented a draft collective agreement. Having received two drafts, IOE stated that the two organisations should first of all reach agreement, knowing very well that the puppet union would not agree to do so. The draft agreement had not, in fact, produced any results. Renewed pressure was exerted to make workers leave the SITET, and although the other union fell into Communist hands, according to the complainants, that did not change the IOE's attitude to ASDEICE, some of whose members were even promoted.
.SITET then submitted a complaint to the Minister. As the manager of IOE stated that the dispute should be submitted to the labour courts, SITET had followed the procedure for the settlement of disputes of an economic and social nature. The parties had been summoned to appear for conciliation, but the IOE had refused to negotiate. SITET had then sought compulsory arbitration, but that had been refused since, under a special Constitutional provision, the Institute was not obliged to go to arbitration. At that point, the workers had decided to strike, although such action was illegal because IOE is a public service. The employer had then dismissed eight workers, all of whom had seventeen years' service, not for participation in the strike but for unlawful acts harmful to the Institute. The complainant had asked the Ministry of Labour to investigate the unfair accusation and the charges had been proved to be unfounded, but the workers had not been reinstated. Also as a result of the strike, the Secretary-General of SITET, Guido Nez Romn, and other members of the executive, together with the dismissed workers, had been accused of incitement to the collective stoppage, which was an offence under Article  of the Labour Code; their case was under investigation.
.Since then, SITET stated, the situation had become worse and pressure on the union had increased; workers had been dismissed on any pretext, without any of the benefits to which they were legally entitled. The management had organised what was known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", composed of all the heads of department, who visited all the work centres to persuade workers to leave the union. According to SITET, it even writes letters of resignation for them. The campaign had enabled management to induce , members to leave the union. Whereas, according to the union rules, workers wishing to resign from the union must apply to the executive which then gives instructions for deductions in respect of union dues to cease, the IOE, according to the complainant, applies other methods. SITET is sometimes informed by the accounts department that a worker has decided to resign from the union and that his contributions would no longer be deducted from his pay; in such cases the union receives no other information than that given by IOE. In other cases, the worker sends his letter of resignation to the chief of personnel, who gives instructions for the deduction of union dues to cease and sends the union a copy of the worker's letter together with a copy of his own letter to the accounts department. Sometimes the worker communicates directly with the accounts department, which crosses the worker off its list. According to SITET, normal procedures are applied in the case of the other union; workers are not crossed off the list but are forced to remain in that organisation. It adds that it has lodged a complaint with the Ministry of Labour but so far has not heard of any action being taken.
.The second communication from SITET concerns another practice of the same type: it claims that the chief of the personnel office ceased deducting the trade union dues of some workers, whereas the union had merely asked him to suspend the loan repayments to one of the union's bodies.
.The Government replied by two communications of  November and  December . Concerning the dismissal of eight strikers, it pointed out that the action taken by IOE was illegal and referred in this connection to Section  of the Constitution and Sections , ,  and  of the Labour Code. Section  specifically bans strikes in public services and stipulates that any conflicts arising in such services shall be referred to the labour courts. Section  defines as public services all activities performed by employees of the State or of its institutions where the activities of the State or its institutions are not the same as those of private firms or agencies working for reward.
.The Government submitted a copy of the ruling of the labour court (and that of the Supreme Labour Court confirming it), to the effect that negotiations had been broken off following a threat of strike which it declared to be illegal. Consequently, it is the Government's opinion that there were sufficient grounds for dismissal under Article  of the Labour Code. From later talks held with a view to restoring peace between the employer and workers, the IOE had appeared to be prepared not to dismiss workers merely for having gone on strike and to dismiss only those strikers who had acted in a manner prejudicial to the undertaking by deeds punishable under the Penal Code. In the light of that implicit undertaking and at the request of the trade union, the Ministry of Labour had carried out an investigation into the criminal liability of the dismissed workers. Seven of the eight had not participated in any punishable act, but the Institute nevertheless dismissed them, which it was legally entitled to do.
.Regarding the criminal proceedings brought against the Secretary-General of SITET, the Government states that the IOE had brought legal proceedings pursuant to Sections ,  and  of the Penal Code. The articles in question read:
.""The sanctions specified in section , increased by one-third for any person responsible for jeopardising the common weal, shall be imposed for:
.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years for any person guilty of creating a public danger or of impeding or hampering the normal operation of transport by land, sea, air or water, or of impeding or hampering public communication services or public power services in any form.
.""The penalty shall be imprisonment for six months to two years and a fine consisting of a percentage of the income earned over a period of from  to  days for any person guilty of having urged officials or employees of public services collectively to abandon their work.""
.The Government points out that Mr. Nez Roman has never been committed to gaol. The investigating magistrate had ordered ""imprisonment and trial"", but the accused had been left free pending trial and the case had not closed. During the proceedings, the counsel for the",1,1973,Costa Rica
87,"defence had lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court on the grounds that Article  of the Penal Code was unconstitutional, but the appeal had been rejected. In addition, a bill had been submitted to the Legislative Assembly for the abrogation of Section  of the Penal Code, for which the Social Affairs Committee of the Assembly had, by a majority vote, expressed its support.
.The Government confirms the existence of a ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", but denies that the group puts pressure on workers to resign from the union. The Government included a large mass of documentation with its comments, including in particular a copy of the report on the investigations carried out by the labour inspectorate on the allegations of trade union persecution. According to this document, the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"" was endeavouring to restore peace amongst the personnel of the Institute at a time when the other union, the ASDEICE, was preparing a strike in sympathy with the SITET strikers who had been dismissed. Twenty-five of the workers questioned had stated to the investigator that they had left the SITET without any pressure from the group. The investigators stated that they had found no proof that members of the group had drafted some of the resignation letters referred to; most of them had been written by the heads of the offices at the various workplaces, in all cases at the request of the workers concerned. The Government attaches to its letter the text of statements obtained from the workers questioned. The reasons given for the resignations included in particular disagreement with the decision to strike and the need to use the union contribution money for other purposes.
.The document indicates that  workers left the union between  June  and  May . In some cases the worker informed the union of his decision in writing; the worker sometimes asked the employer to cease deducting union dues from his pay because he was leaving the union; there were also cases in which workers sent a collective notice of resignation to the employer in the same way; in the majority of cases, the personnel department had received from the workers concerned a copy of the letter of resignation sent to the union and in such cases the employer had not checked whether the union had in fact received the original. The report in question concludes that the procedure followed by IOE to strike the names of resigning workers from the list it had prepared for check-off purposes is an internal matter, since, when notified of the resignations by one of the means mentioned, the personnel department instructs the accounts department to cease the deduction of union dues from the pay of the former union member.
.The case thus relates mainly to the strike declared by SITET in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and to certain forms of trade union persecution which are supposed to have taken place within that institute.
.The Committee notes that relations between the IOE and SITET had been very strained since the creation of that union and that the latter complained of pressures exerted on its members to persuade them to leave the union and of the support which the Institute had given to the creation and activities of another union. The Committee also notes that the strike was started after the failure of negotiations and that, according to the complainants, the IOE refused to submit the dispute to compulsory arbitration as permitted under the law establishing that body. The strike was illegal since IOE is classified as a public service in which all strikes are forbidden (sections  and  of the Labour Code). According to the employer, the dismissal of eight strikers was due not to their participation in the strike action, but to committed actions harmful to the undertaking and punishable under law. The Committee nevertheless notes that an investigation carried out by the Ministry of Labour disclosed that seven of the eight dismissed workers had not committed any punishable offence. The decision to dismiss them was nevertheless maintained.
.On the basis of the principle whereby allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee has, in similar cases and particularly in cases relating to Costa Rica, held that, while restrictions on the right to strike in the public service or in essential services could be accepted, there should, in such cases, be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who are thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, which implies that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages. In the case under discussion the strike had been started after the breakdown of negotiations. However, if, as claimed by SITET, arbitration could be refused by the IOE in application of a special provision, the workers of that Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests, which is contrary to the principle mentioned above.
.Regarding the allegations concerning trade union persecution, the investigation carried out by the labour inspectorate showed that twenty-five workers questioned had stated that they had left SITET without undergoing pressure from the group known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", because they did not support the strike, because they needed the money which would have been used for union dues, or for other reasons. However, the Committee considers it somewhat strange that in many cases union members wishing to leave the union communicated firstly and sometimes only with the employer, that union members submitted collective resignations and that resignation letters were often written by the chiefs of offices at the request of the workers concerned. It considers that if the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"" was encouraged by the management to induce workers to leave the union, that would constitute an infringement of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to call attention, with regard to the allegations concerning trade union persecution, to the considerations set out in paragraph ;(b) to emphasise, concerning the allegations relating to the strike, the importance which it attaches to the principle that, where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services, there should, in such cases, be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who are thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, and that such restrictions should be accompanied in all cases by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.",-1,1973,Costa Rica

The reasons given for the resignations included in particular disagreement with the decision to strike and the need to use the union contribution money for other purposes.
.The document indicates that  workers left the union between  June  and  May . In some cases the worker informed the union of his decision in writing; the worker sometimes asked the employer to cease deducting union dues from his pay because he was leaving the union; there were also cases in which workers sent a collective notice of resignation to the employer in the same way; in the majority of cases, the personnel department had received from the workers concerned a copy of the letter of resignation sent to the union and in such cases the employer had not checked whether the union had in fact received the original. The report in question concludes that the procedure followed by IOE to strike the names of resigning workers from the list it had prepared for check-off purposes is an internal matter, since, when notified of the resignations by one of the means mentioned, the personnel department instructs the accounts department to cease the deduction of union dues from the pay of the former union member.
.The case thus relates mainly to the strike declared by SITET in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and to certain forms of trade union persecution which are supposed to have taken place within that institute.
.The Committee notes that relations between the IOE and SITET had been very strained since the creation of that union and that the latter complained of pressures exerted on its members to persuade them to leave the union and of the support which the Institute had given to the creation and activities of another union. The Committee also notes that the strike was started after the failure of negotiations and that, according to the complainants, the IOE refused to submit the dispute to compulsory arbitration as permitted under the law establishing that body. The strike was illegal since IOE is classified as a public service in which all strikes are forbidden (sections  and  of the Labour Code). According to the employer, the dismissal of eight strikers was due not to their participation in the strike action, but to committed actions harmful to the undertaking and punishable under law. The Committee nevertheless notes that an investigation carried out by the Ministry of Labour disclosed that seven of the eight dismissed workers had not committed any punishable offence. The decision to dismiss them was nevertheless maintained.
.On the basis of the principle whereby allegations relating to the right to strike are not outside its competence in so far as they affect the exercise of trade union rights, the Committee has, in similar cases and particularly in cases relating to Costa Rica, held that, while restrictions on the right to strike in the public service or in essential services could be accepted, there should, in such cases, be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who are thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, which implies that such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages. In the case under discussion the strike had been started after the breakdown of negotiations. However, if, as claimed by SITET, arbitration could be refused by the IOE in application of a special provision, the workers of that Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests, which is contrary to the principle mentioned above.
.Regarding the allegations concerning trade union persecution, the investigation carried out by the labour inspectorate showed that twenty-five workers questioned had stated that they had left SITET without undergoing pressure from the group known as the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"", because they did not support the strike, because they needed the money which would have been used for union dues, or for other reasons. However, the Committee considers it somewhat strange that in many cases union members wishing to leave the union communicated firstly and sometimes only with the employer, that union members submitted collective resignations and that resignation letters were often written by the chiefs of offices at the request of the workers concerned. It considers that if the ""Group for the Preservation of the IOE"" was encouraged by the management to induce workers to leave the union, that would constitute an infringement of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to call attention, with regard to the allegations concerning trade union persecution, to the considerations set out in paragraph ;(b) to emphasise, concerning the allegations relating to the strike, the importance which it attaches to the principle that, where restrictions are placed on the right to strike in essential services, there should, in such cases, be adequate guarantees to safeguard the interests of the workers who are thereby deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests, and that such restrictions should be accompanied in all cases by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties concerned can participate at all stages.",-1,1973,Costa Rica
90,"it again made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information.
.Regarding Cases Nos. , ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: three communications, of  October ,  September  and  June , from the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), a communication of  November , from the National Federation of Dockworkers, two communications, of  May  and  November , from the Stevedores' Union (POASI), a communication of  August , from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), two communications, of  September  and  July , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), three communications, of  November ,  July and  October , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).
.These complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, with requests for observations. Apart from some very general replies sent by communications of  January and  July , and despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the first complaints (Case No. ), the Committee received no information from the Government on the various allegations. In November  and May , the Committee sent urgent requests to the Government to submit the information requested (Case No. ).
.As the information requested on all these cases was not received, the Committee asked the Director-General in November  to communicate with the highest level of the Government, on behalf of the Committee, expressing the Committee's concern and urgently requesting the Government to provide the observations requested from it (Cases Nos. , ,  and ). The Government finally submitted information by communications of ,  and  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).",-1,1973,Dominican Republic
91,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.
.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May ",-1,1973,Dominican Republic
92,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",-1,1973,Dominican Republic
93,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1973,Dominican Republic
94,".The complaint of the Latin American Central of Workers is contained in a communication dated  June . This complaint was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.Colombia has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  June , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) states that it filed its complaint against the Government of Colombia on behalf of the Colombian Television Association (ACOTV). It annexes to its communication a letter from this Association dated  June .
.In this letter the ACOTV states the facts which, it claims, forced it to declare a strike in view of the slowness to react of the Government and of the managing bodies of the National Institute of Radio-Television (Inravision).
.In December  the ACOTV submitted to the Inravision Board of Directors a memorandum claiming salary increases. The board replied that on legal grounds this document could not be examined.
.The ACOTV added that the Supreme Court of Justice of Colombia had declared that section  of Extraordinary Decree No.  of  was unconstitutional. That provision read as follows: ""Management boards or councils of state establishments and of state industrial and commercial enterprises shall, within twelve months following the date of assent to the present Decree, prepare for government approval a draft statute for their personnel covering: the definition of the conditions for the creation, suppression and amalgamation of positions and admission to service; administrative and disciplinary regulations, the scope of the administrative career and the relevant procedures; similarly everything related to the classification and remuneration of jobs, allowances and bonuses, entertainment allowances, travelling expenses, overtime, social security benefits, and the conditions for appointment on mission at home and abroad.""
.The ACOTV adds that following this decision by the Supreme Court, the Board of Directors of Inravision refused to discuss its salary claim.
.The Public Service Commission, acting on government instructions, sent a circular to the directors of state establishments informing them that Boards of Directors of such establishments were not competent to determine remuneration levels, since the Supreme Court considered that such questions fell within the competence of the Congress; the Public Service Commission added that these matters would continue to be governed by the legal standards in force and the regulations drawn up by state establishments and approved by the Government before  December , which is the date of the Court's Order. Similarly, questions relating to the creation, suppression or amalgamation of positions would be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Supply Act and the various decrees of , without implying prejudice to the power to change or supplement the salary system applicable in each organisation.
.But, the ACOTV adds, this provision cannot be applied in the case of Inravision since the personnel statutes have not been approved by the Government and, moreover, section  of Decree No.  of  provides that the standards which at present govern matters covered by section  will remain in force until the Government has approved the draft statute referred to in section .
.In view of this situation, the ACOTV sent seventeen messages to the President of the Republic but claims to have received no reply. The general assembly of the ACOTV then threatened to strike if its claims were not examined within eight days.
.Moreover, the lawyers of the ACOTV drew up, at the latter's request, a legal opinion indicating that the management of Inravision could recognise that its employees have the status of ""official employees"" since Inravision is a state commercial undertaking.
.The ACOTV points out that Inravision then had a legal opinion drawn up which arrived at identical conclusions, namely, that since they had the status of ""official employees"" the workers of this body automatically enjoyed the rights provided by the Labour Code with respect to the presentation of wage claims and collective negotiation.
.The ACOTV adds that in spite of these legal opinions the management of Inravision began to use delaying tactics and refused its requests for interviews. In these circumstances the general assembly of the ACOTV decided to call a general strike, during which the workers were expelled by the army and the police, although according to the ACOTV, their movement acted peacefully from every point of view.
.In its communication dated  October  the Government confirms the declaration of the Colombian Supreme Court that section  of Decree No.  of  is unconstitutional. It points out that Inravision could not discuss the claims of the ACOTV, adding that this was explained at length to the trade union. The Government points out that in January  it presented a draft Bill in which it requested the Congress to grant it extraordinary powers in order to solve the problems raised by wage claims in state establishments. The Government also points out that during that period Inravision continued its discussions with the trade unions.
.Following the stoppage of work ordered by the ACOTV on  March  the Ministry of Labour and Social Security declared that the strike was illegal and suspended the legal personality of ACOTV for six months. As the dispute continued, Inravision dismissed several officials.
.According to the Government the argument that the employees of Inravision should be considered ""official employees"" is not self-evident. Inasmuch as Inravision is a state establishment, its employees should be considered ""public employees"" without the right to strike.
.The Committee has examined the provisions of the Colombia Labour Code relating to official employees and public employees. It has noted that section  of the Labour Code makes a distinction between public employees and official employees. This section states that unions of public employees may not submit claims or conclude collective agreements; but it adds that unions of other official employees enjoy all the rights of other trade unions and that their claims shall be studied in the same light as those of other trade unions even if they may neither declare nor hold strikes.
.The Committee notes that the allegations relate essentially to the right of collective bargaining in a public establishment, the National Radio Television Institute. It also notes that the staff union of this body considers that the staff should be considered official employees and should thus enjoy the right of collective bargaining.
.On the other hand, the Committee notes that the Government does not share this point of view and considers that the employees of Inravision should be considered ""public employees"" and hence that their union may not negotiate collective agreements. The Committee also notes that the Ministry of Labour suspended the legal personality of the Colombian Television Association following the declaration that the strike was illegal.
.The Committee wishes first of all to stress, as it has done in previous cases relating to Colombia, that suspension by the Ministry of Labour of the legal personality of a union - the legal personality being one of the conditions enabling the union to function - is contrary to the generally admitted principle that unions should not be liable to administrative suspension.
.As for the allegations relating to the right to bargain collectively, the Committee considers that in the present case it is first of all a question of determining to what extent the principle contained in Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), according to which measures appropriate to national conditions should be taken to encourage and promote the voluntary negotiation of collective agreements, applies to the workers concerned. Article  of that Convention allows the exclusion of ""public servants"". In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has pointed out, that, while the concept of public servant may vary to some degree under the various national legal systems, the exclusion from the scope of the Convention of persons employed by the State or in the public sector but who do not act as agents of the public authority (even though they may be given a status identical with that of public officials engaged in the administration of the State) is contrary to the meaning of the Convention. The distinction to be drawn, according to the Committee, would appear to be basically between civil servants employed in various capacities in government ministries or comparable bodies on the one hand and other persons employed by the Government, by public undertakings or by autonomous public institutions. According to this criterion, it would not appear that the staff of Inravision can be excluded by reason of their duties from the principle concerning the promotion of collective bargaining.
.In these circumstances and with respect to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle set out in paragraph  above according to which the employers' and workers' organisations should not be subject to administrative suspension;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and",0,1973,Colombia
95,"acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment and that such protection shall apply particularly in respect of acts calculated to cause the dismissal of or otherwise prejudice a worker by reason of union membership.
.The Committee notes that Guatemalan legislation contains a number of provisions designed to protect workers against acts of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, however, there are grounds for doubting whether in fact ""adequate protection"" against such acts has in fact been provided; in fact, the acts committed appear to have led to the actual disappearance of the unions concerned, since each of them consisted of workers in a single undertaking.
.In these circumstances, and to avoid the recurrence of such situations, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to request the Government to examine this question with a view to taking such steps as may be necessary to make more effective the protection against anti-union practices provided for under Convention No.  as well as under its own national legislation.
.The complaint of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) is contained in a communication dated  January , and is supported by the World Federation of Trade Unions in a communication dated  March . These complaints have been transmitted to the Government, which forwarded its observations thereon in a communication dated  November .
.Guatemala has ratified both the Freedom of Association and the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state that the trade union movement in Guatemala is encountering great hardship and that there is a concerted campaign on the part of employers to destroy trade unionism in the country by forcing workers to relinquish membership of trade unions or else be dismissed.
.The complainants provide several examples of such actions. They allege that on  June  the workers of Fbricas Electrnicas Unidas established a union. The president of the company is said to have responded by massive dismissals ( to date) and threatens to continue this policy of dismissal if the union is not dissolved.
.It is alleged that on  November  a union of the workers of the undertaking Fbrica de Plsticos Zelaya Zimeri y Compaa Limitada was formed. The management summarily dismissed all workers who became members of the union, including the officers of the executive Committee. As a result the union ceased to exist.
.Similarly, on  December , the workers at the Laboratorios Pierre Bonin Sucesores Compaa Limitada formed a union, but because of the immediate wave of dismissals which followed the rest of the workers showed no further interest in joining it.
.The complainants stress that this is only a partial list and that very large numbers of workers have been victimised by various managements on the sole grounds of having joined a trade union.
.Complaints in respect of these cases have been filed with the national labour authorities but, the complainants allege, no effort has been made to force the employers to comply with the laws forbidding such acts of anti-union discrimination.
.The Government replies by transmitting the reports of various departments of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The officer in charge of the Workers' Protection Department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security states that departmental policy has always been to ensure compliance with the legal provisions protecting freedom of association and to help the workers to unionise in every way possible. If in certain cases the authorities are slow to act, the officer continues, this is usually because of a lack of co-operation on the part of the unions themselves since they do not comply with the requirements of the law when submitting complaints.
.The National Department of Labour Inspection for Industry, Commerce and Services states that all the allegations made by the FASGUA concerning the passivity of governmental labour authorities are untrue. The procedures stipulated by the law in relation to trade union matters, such as verification of the number of workers employed in the undertaking on the day of the union vote, warnings denunciation and renegotiation of the collective agreements, warnings to employers that they must reinstate dismissed union officers, and the commencement of proceedings in the courts of competent jurisdiction, have been undertaken.
.This same department states further that its competence is limited to the application of standards contained in the Labour Code of Guatemala and that it usually attempts to proceed by way of conciliation. When its possibilities of administrative intervention are exhausted and the conflict has still not been resolved, the matter is referred to the labour tribunals. Where there are delays, the department alleges, these can be imputed to the unions themselves, which do not comply with the legal prerequisites provided for in such cases.
.On the basis of these statements, the Government reiterates its general polio of promotion of freedom of association and the right to organise and repeats that the appropriate government departments have undertaken all the necessary and possible procedures for the protection of these rights. It therefore requests the Committee to recommend the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee notes the statements of the Government concerning the latter's general policy in labour matters but notes also that the Government has not provided any information concerning the specific allegations made by the complainants and the steps taken by the labour authorities in the case of the workers of Fbricas Electrnicas Unidas, the Fbrica de Plsticos Zelaya Zimeri y Compaa Limitada and the Laboratorios Pierre Bonin Sucesores Compaia Limitada who were allegedly dismissed on the sole ground of being members of a trade union.",0,1973,Guatemala
96,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",-1,1973,Dominican Republic
97,"of  August ) was promulgated for the purpose of regulating trade union activities, but had been only partially applied. Although many of the unions had complied with the necessary formalities before the decision to suspend the application of Decree No. , which was taken shortly after its adoption, they had been unable to have themselves placed on the national register of trade unions. Despite the suspension of the Decree, the provisions relating to the prohibition of strikes and political activities by the trade unions had been applied. After his second direct contacts mission to Uruguay (April ), the representative of the Director-General pointed out that from the legal point of view, it might be said that, except for the promulgation of the Decree respecting the setting up of joint Committees in undertakings, dated  February , the situation had remained unchanged and the trade unions had a de facto but not a de jure existence.
.Nevertheless, as the Committee noted in May , the factual situation had changed: there had been an improvement in that of the trade unions affiliated to the General Confederation of Workers of Uruguay (CGTU), which had been able to perform certain internal activities (meetings, elections, etc.). On the other hand, the unions affiliated to the National Workers' Convention (CNT), which was dissolved by the Government after the change of regime in , appeared to have remained to a large extent inactive: many of their leaders were detained, had left the country or had been dismissed; the premises of a number of these unions were being watched by the police, had been closed, or were under surveillance, etc. As for industrial relations activities, the extent of recognition of the unions of the CGTU and their leaders depended on whether they were on good terms with the employers or the heads of public administrative services. As to the unions affiliated to the CNT, these did not appear to be recognised either in the private or in the public sector.
.The Government also referred on more than one occasion to the subversive activities with which it had had to deal and which had constituted the reasons for the exceptional measures taken in the trade union and other fields. In this respect the Committee emphasised that there should be no confusion between trade unions' performance of their specific functions, i.e. the defence and promotion of the occupational interests of workers, and the possible ---------- pursuit by certain of their members of other activities having nothing to do with trade union functions. The penal responsibilities which such persons might incur by such acts should in no way result in measures amounting to depriving the unions themselves or their leaders of their means of action.
.The Government also declared that the normalisation of the trade union situation had to be analysed within the broader framework of the political and institutional normalisation of the country. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that, although respect for freedom of association is closely bound up with respect for civil liberties in general, as was stated by the International Labour Conference in  in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, it was nevertheless important, with this reservation, to distinguish between the recognition of freedom of association and questions relating to a country's political evolution; trade union legislation and the reform of a country's political institutions were two separate matters. The Committee had on different occasions drawn the attention of the Government to the need to adopt and apply legislation in conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.In February  the Committee examined the text of a draft Bill on occupational associations which had been communicated to it by the Government it remarked that this text had certain positive features but felt obliged to make observations regarding a number of other provisions which did not appear to be in conformity with certain principles of freedom of association. In bringing these observations to the notice of the Government, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, stressed the urgency of Uruguay's adopting and applying legislation based on the principles of freedom of association and requested the Government to bring the draft text fully into line with the freedom of association Conventions ratified by Uruguay. It also requested the Government to supply information on any developments in this area.
.The Committee was also called upon to examine the cases of numerous detained trade unionists whose names, and in many cases their trade union functions, had been mentioned in the complaints. The Committee noted the information supplied by the Government according to which certain of these persons had never been arrested or had been released. During the direct contacts the Government supplied information giving the impression that the criminal proceedings set in motion were aimed first of all at activities of a political character considered by the Government to endanger security and public order. However, the representative of the Director-General found that some of the charges were accompanied by other accusations linked to the activities of the CNT, which was dissolved by the Government in  in a smaller number of cases the Committee noted that the persons concerned had been arrested for reasons which could be considered as being linked solely with their trade union activities, in its subsequent written communications the Government confined itself to quoting sections of the ordinary or military penal codes under which trade unionists had been prosecuted or sentenced, but did not supply details of the specific offences with which they had been charged in each case; nor had it communicated the texts of the judgements rendered in each case, as requested by the Governing Body. In the absence of more detailed information, the Committee noted that it had no facts at its disposal enabling it to ascertain whether the trade unionists were sentenced purely for reasons unconnected with their trade union office or activities.
.The Committee also regretted that the Government had not supplied detailed observations on the allegations relating to the ill-treatment allegedly suffered by certain prisoners and to the precariousness of the right to defence. As regards the latter point, the complainants had stated that, at first, civilian lawyers had been, able to carry out their functions and defend prisoners. This situation had deteriorated progressively and they had been confronted with obstacles in the exercise of their profession, especially as regards being able to communicate with their clients. Subsequently, stated the complainants, lawyers had been arrested and accused, for example, of complicity with the prisoners; others had been threatened and had left the country. Those who had been released could no longer exercise their professional activities. As for the detained workers, they were informed, often after lengthy imprisonment, that they must choose a lawyer in  hours. Having no contact with the outside, they were obliged to accept a lawyer appointed on their behalf so that the trial was not delayed further. Other allegations referred to ill-treatment allegedly suffered by imprisoned trade unionists (case of Mr. Iguini).
.At its February-March  session the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, repeated its request to the Government for information on the specific acts for which trade unionists had been prosecuted or sentenced (including copies of the judgements) and or the allegations concerning ill-treatment of prisoners and obstruction of their right to defence. It urged the Government to supply the information requested on the trade unionists listed in the annex to the st Report of the Committee.
.In its letter of  February  the Trade Unions International of Workers in the Metal Industry refers to the case of Rosario Pietraroia, General Secretary of the National Union of workers in the metal and Allied Trades (UNTMRA), who was arrested in  and sentenced to  years' imprisonment in October . The complainant goes on to say that his health has deteriorated as a result of torture, and he has even lost an eye; the authorities want him to be operated on in prison, although there is no guarantee of success, since the premises are not properly equipped. The complainant organisation states that it has fears for the prisoner's life.
.In addition, WFTU alleges, in its letter of  March , that Carlos Gmez, a former official of the Uruguayan Bank Employees' Association, has been imprisoned; the prisoner, who is now retired, was for several years a senior official in this trade union. WFTU also refers to the sentence of four years' imprisonment passed on Rubn Acasuso, former General Secretary of the Uruguayan Press Association. Finally, the complainant states that the whereabouts of Eduardo Arign, a commerce worker who has been imprisoned since  June , are unknown.
.In its letter of  April , the Government supplies information on many of the trade unionists cited by the complainants; the situation of some of them remains unchanged with respect to the information previously supplied; details in this regard are given in the annexes to the present report. In particular, the Government mentions that",0,1973,Uruguay
98,"cases workers who request the setting up of such commissions are being subjected to pressure and persecution.
.The WFTU further states that trade union premises, which are the property of the workers' organisations, have been closed, thus depriving the trade unions, and their leaders as a whole, of their means of action, and that government bodies have occupied the premises in question. The WFTU mentions the case of the Unified National Trade Union of Construction Workers and Allied Trades (SUNCA), whose premises have apparently become the barracks of the Grenadier Guards, the case of the National Union of Metalworkers and Allied Trades (UNTMRA), whose premises have apparently become the headquarters of Police Section , of the National Workers' Convention (CNT), whose premises have apparently become a centre for the women police of Montevideo (and whose equipment is being used by department No.  of the police), the case of the Metalworkers' Federation, the use of whose premises has been requested by the Police Commissioner of section No. , the case of the Federation of Primary School Teachers' Unions and that of the Secondary School Teachers' Trade Union, whose premises have also apparently become para-military installations.
.The WFTU emphasises that all trade union activities have been suppressed six years ago, that the experience with joint commissions has been negative and that the Government alleges that the steps to be taken in trade union matters must be tied to the process of ""national reconstruction"". The WFTU draws particular attention to the numerous dismissals continuously taking place on the basis of institutional Act No.  ( members of the staff of the Clnicas Hospital were thus dismissed in January ). The WFTU concludes that these dilatory tactics, obviously in expectation of the complete suppression of all attempts at free trade union activity, show the illusory character of the promise of trade union freedom.
.The WFTU also points out that the state of health of Rosario Pietraroia and of Gerardo Cuesta is precarious. It reiterates that, contrary to the Government's statements, Oscar Tassino Atz (trade union organiser of the AUTE) has disappeared after his arrest on  July , and quotes statements by eyewitnesses in support. The complainant adds that Alicia Surez is being illegally held in prison after having served her sentence and that new waves of arrests, followed by torture, have occurred in February and March ; the prisoners include, in particular, Hctor Giacobone (secretary to the Meatworkers' Federation), of the meat-packing sector, and Csar Gmez, of the banking sector. In conclusion, the WFTU reiterates its request for the establishment of a commission of inquiry.
.The National Workers' Convention (CNT) asserts, in its letter of  September , that the police headquarters of Montevideo has notified the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) on  July  that its legal personality was ""without effect"", in accordance with Decree No.   dated  August . The complainant attaches a photocopy of this notification and adds that the deduction from wages of the trade union dues of AEBU members has been discontinued. The complainant also quotes a decision of the Ministry of the Interior (dated  July ) ordering the President of AEBU to hand over within  days to the National Office of information and Research a list of members of a new governing board consisting of persons having no ""adverse past records"", so that the authorities may, upon request, later allow artistic and cultural events to take place under the supervision of the above-mentioned National Office.
.The National Workers' Convention further alleges that pressure is being exerted on the workers, even those who are under arrest, to make them join together in a nationalist trade union. The authorities have allegedly filmed the delegates at a meeting in the ""Sadil"" textile factory because the latter refused to allow the military to participate in the meeting. The CNT also expresses its concern regarding living conditions in the prisons where- the trade union leaders are detained (under-nourishment, absence of adequate medical care and sanitation, total lack of medicaments, ill-treatment and repression). The CNT mentions in particular the case of Rosario Pietraroia who has lost an eye for lack of proper medical care.
.The Government states, in its letter dated  September , that the period has now concluded during which the authorities received suggestions from the worker and employer organisations on the preliminary draft of the bill on professional associations. The comments made by the organisations consulted have been transmitted to the group of experts which had drawn up the preliminary draft. The latter is now analysing the observations submitted, as well as the comments by the ILO supervisory organs. The Government also states that once the study and adoption of the preliminary draft is completed, these experts will submit their final report to the executive branch of the Government. The Government will then take a decision on the matter; it has the intention of submitting the final draft law to the Council of State by  December .
.Moreover, the Government indicates that in its communication of  November that the executive intends to suggest to the legislative authorities a rapid examination of the Bill mentioned above which could be done in the legislative paper accompanying it. In addition, the Government supplies information on the persons listed in the annexes to the th Report; it appears from this, in particular, that Manuel Pieiro Pena and Alicia Dinorah Surez Turcati have been released. It also states that Hector Agustin Giacobone Marrero and Csar Clelio Gmez Mello have been brought before the military courts.
.The Committee takes note of the information supplied by the Government on the state of the preliminary work on the Act concerning professional associations. It notes, in particular, that the comments made by the ILO supervisory organs are now being examined, that the final draft of the Act is due to be submitted to the Council of State by  December  and that the Government will suggest that it should examine it rapidly. The Committee wishes to reiterate that, after six years of serious restrictions upon trade union activities, there is a very urgent need to promulgate and implement a legislation which recognises the right for all workers, without any distinction whatsoever, to set up occupational organisations and the right of these organisations to function and operate freely, in accordance with the various Conventions on freedom of association.
.In addition, the Government has sent, at the commencement of the Committee's session, certain information on the situation of the trade unionists listed in the annexes to the th Report. The Committee intends to examine this information at its next session. Nevertheless, it notes now that Manuel Pieiro Pena (see paragraph ) and Alicia Dinorah Surez Turcati (see paragraph ) have been released. It also notes that Hctor Agustin Giacobone Marrero and Csar Clelio Grimez Mello (see paragraph ) have been brought before the military courts.
.The complainants have, however, submitted new complaints, some of them recently, to which the Government has not yet replied. These complaints deal more particularly with the following points: (a) the dilatory attitude of the authorities regarding a return to freedom of association (including various forms of pressure exerted on the workers, the negative experience of joint commissions and new dismissals based on Institutional Act No. ); (b) the continued occupation of trade union premises; (c) measures taken against the AEBU; and (d) conditions of detention and situation of various arrested trade unionists.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the Government's statement to the effect that it proposes to submit the draft Act on occupational associations to the Council of State by  December , and to suggest a rapid examination of it;(b) to express the firm hope that this draft, in its final version, will be in full conformity with ILO Conventions Nos.  and  which have been ratified by Uruguay, to urge the Government to adopt it in the very near future and to ask the Government to give the date on which it is envisaged that it will be promulgated;(c) to ask the Government to send the draft Act which will be submitted to the Council of State and to supply information on any developments which may take place;(d) to urge the Government to transmit its observations and additional information on the new allegations of the complainants, summarised in paragraph  above;(e) to ask the Government to send the information requested in subparagraphs (b) and (d) above by  January  at the latest;(f) to note that the Committee will carry out a new examination of this case as a whole at its neat session and take note, in the meantime, of the present interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.Since  the Committee has had before it complaints relating in part to the general trade union situation in the country. A few months after the dissolution by the Government of a trade union Confederation, the National Workers' Convention (CNT), a Decree (No. ",0,1973,Uruguay
99,"about ten persons have been released, one conditionally. Rosario Pietraroia was arrested on  January  and his trial by the military courts began on  August ; he was sentenced by the court of first instance to  years' imprisonment (minus preventive detention) and appealed against this decision to the Supreme Military Tribunal. According to the Government, there is no evidence of a deterioration in his health.
.In February , the Committee noted that the Government had confined itself to quoting sections of the ordinary or military penal codes under which trade unionists had been prosecuted or sentenced, without supplying details of the specific offences with which they had been charged in each case. In this connection, the Government stresses that the trade unionists whose names are cited by the complainants were arrested, prosecuted or sentenced not because of their presumed trade union membership or activities but as citizens or residents of the country subject to its laws. In all cases, adds the Government, the action was taken solely on the grounds of the criminal behaviour of the accused and in no case by reason of their actual or presumed trade union activities. Furthermore, the status of trade unionist is not acquired by the mere fact of exercising an activity, occupation or trade, as is the case, according to the Government, of the persons concerned in most of the complaints presented; a trade union member or official is one who militates actively within a trade union or who holds office therein. A person who militates actively in the field of politics properly speaking, using his position as a trade unionist in order to further a given political ideology or even, in many cases, as a cover for subversive activity, can obviously not be considered as a trade unionist, even if he attempts to dissimulate his true activities by this means. The Government goes on to state that it has furnished the information requested as far as it is in its power to do so and that it has already explained why it has not given details of the specific offences or other information requested; these, states the Government, lie solely within the competence of the judicial administration, the accused and their counsel, and it is accordingly not for the Government to supply them. The Government stresses that the application of the law on the national territory is secured by the legally constituted judicial authorities, and it is for them to decide whether an activity is criminal or otherwise. The Government and the judicial authorities respect the law, and it is for the latter to pass judgement in conformity with the national legislation in force, including duly ratified Conventions.
.As regards the allegations concerning the precariousness of the right to defence and the ill-treatment alleged to have been inflicted on certain of the prisoners, the Government considers that it is for the complainants to prove these accusations and that the burden of proof cannot be laid on the Government, since the alleged facts are non-existent. If the complainants claim that there has been a failure to observe the law in specific circumstances, they must furnish detailed evidence in support of their allegations to enable the latter to be examined and refuted, as will undoubtedly be the case in all instances. Finally, the Government requests that complaints should be framed in a more serious spirit, with at least a minimum of detail, and that they should no longer contain lists of persons whose surnames and given names are incomplete or inaccurate, who are stated to have engaged in imaginary trade union activities or who, according to frivolous, malicious and entirely unfounded allegations, are said to have been denied guarantees for their defence, to have suffered ill-treatment, etc.
.In addition, the Government expresses its gratitude for the Committee's valuable comments on the draft Bill on occupational associations. It states its conviction that these comments will permit improvements in the concepts set forth in the text which is to be submitted to the Council of State. The Government states in its letter of  May  that; following upon its consultations, it sent on  May  a copy of this draft Bill to the most representative workers' and employers' organisations and invited them to make such comments and suggestions as they thought appropriate. Moreover, it adds, this document received the greatest publicity through the different media so as to make it known to public opinion in general.
.Finally, the Government supplies statistics on joint Committees in undertakings:  are operational,  are shortly to be set up and  are in process of formation. The sectors of activity covered are the following: the textile industry, electronics, private banking, social bodies, cement products, construction, the chemical, glass, sugar, tobacco and dairy products industries, engineering, metallurgy, horse-racing, the drinks industry and broadcasting.
.The Committee notes the observations and information communicated by the Government. In this connection it must stress, firstly, the abnormal situation of the entire Uruguayan trade union movement since the change of regime in June . As recalled in paragraphs  and  above, the trade unions are unable to carry out their specific activities, since their recognition by the authorities and by the employers depends upon a status governed by legislation which has not yet been promulgated. In these circumstances trade union activities in conformity with the international standards in this field may in practice be considered as illegal or not safeguarded by law, contrary to the international obligations assumed by Uruguay when it ratified the-freedom of association Conventions.
.The obstacles to the exercise of trade union rights resulting from this situation are set forth in paragraph  above. In addition, a number of joint Committees ( of which are operational) have been set up in undertakings under a Decree of  February . The Committee has noted this latest development but has stressed that such bodies may not serve as substitutes for trade union organisations. In this connection it feels obliged to recall that the National Constitution guarantees the right of association (section ) as well as the right of workers to form trade unions and the right to strike (section ), and that Uruguay has also ratified Conventions Nos.  and , which lay down basic rights in the field of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, after six years of substantial restrictions on the principal trade union activities, it has now become extremely urgent to adopt an Act respecting occupational associations in conformity with international standards on freedom of association. Likewise, in the situation mentioned above, the question of the arrest and treatment of trade unionists is also of undoubted importance.
.In connection with the latter point, while noting the information supplied by the Government in its most recent communication regarding the release of ten persons, the Committee notes that even recently the complainant organisations were still drawing attention to the harsh sentences served on trade unionists, such as Rosario Pietraroia, General Secretary of the National Union of Workers in the Metal and Allied Trades (UNTMRA), or Rubn Acasuso, former General Secretary of the Uruguayan Press Association. The Governing Body requested the Government to communicate a copy of the judgements rendered in the case of the sentenced trade unionists to enable the Committee to satisfy itself that the persons concerned had not been punished for facts connected with their trade union functions or activities. The Government has not supplied any text of such decisions, but has repeated that these sentences were passed for reasons unrelated to trade union activities.
.In its most recent communication the Government states that it has not been established that certain of the persons mentioned by the complainants were trade unionists and that others merely used their trade union office as a cover for other activities. Nevertheless, the Government does not dispute the fact that other persons who have been prosecuted or sentenced were trade union officials, and the Committee considers that it would have been useful for it to have at its disposal more complete information on the reasons adduced for the prosecution of these persons or the sentences passed on them which have been mentioned by the Government, in particular for the purpose of deciding whether account was taken of their former trade union activities in the application of the sections of the penal legislation quoted by the Government.
.The Committee wishes to recall that in many earlier instances in which cases were pending before a court and the Committee considered that the judgements would provide it with information enabling it to reach conclusions with full knowledge of the facts, it has followed the practice of requesting the Government concerned to communicate the text of the decisions rendered, with the reasons adduced therefor. Governments have generally co operated by sending the texts of the judgements requested. During the last direct contacts mission to the country the Uruguayan Government itself supplied detailed information on the specific offences with which a number of the imprisoned trade unionists were charged, including the grounds for the",0,1973,Uruguay
100,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",-1,1973,Dominican Republic
101,"not imply the ""de jure"" recognition of one of the complainants which holds itself out to be the spokesmen for the National Convention of Workers of Uruguay, an organisation which was declared illegal by the Government on  June .
.As for the Committee, it has examined the draft law on occupational associations and notes that this draft is very similar to the previous draft, which the Committee examined at its February  Session. In these circumstances, the Committee regrets that most of the comments which it made at that time have not been taken into consideration in preparing the present draft. The Committee considers it necessary to recall certain principles and considerations which it put forward when it examined the earlier draft, concerning the provisions which have been retained in the present draft.
.As regards the establishment of organisations, the Committee stressed that workers should be free to decide whether they prefer to establish, at the primary level, a works union. - the only possibility allowed under the draft, except for certain exceptions based on the number of workers - or another form of basic organisation, such as an industrial or craft union. In this connection, the Committee observes that section  of the draft always situates the officers of the primary trade union in the undertaking, and that in addition section  allows the organisation of occupational associations of workers, of office workers, of technicians or of executive personnel. It is not clear whether the latter provision, which was not included in the earlier draft, would allow the establishment of organisations according to occupational categories grouping several undertakings or whether it would otherwise be impossible to establish trade unions at the works level which would include all the workers belonging to different categories of wage-earners. Generally, the Committee considers that provisions limiting a trade union's possible sphere of activity may constitute a violation of the right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing, as required by Article  of Convention No. .
.With regard to the conditions of eligibility of trade union leaders, the Committee recalls that the obligation laid on these leaders to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" may give rise to abuses. The draft still does not state what specific acts are considered to constitute breaches of faith in democracy and thus renders effective legal supervision of the application of this provision impossible. In addition, under sections  and  of the draft read in conjunction, trade union officials must have belonged to the branch of activity represented by the union for at least two years, which, in the Committee's opinion, imposes restrictions on the right of workers freely to elect their trade union representatives.
.As did the earlier draft, this draft regulates in considerable detail the various aspects of the internal administration of trade unions obligatory voting in elections and plebiscites (sections (d) and ); supply of reports on trade union activities whenever authorities so request (section (a)); maximum time limit for trade union assemblies (section ); obligatory organisation of plebiscite to examine draft collective agreements and in other cases provided for by regulations (section ); suspension of the membership of a member who has not taken part in a vote (section ); lower-level trade unions are responsible for decisions taken by higher-level organisations to which they are affiliated, except in specific cases provided for in the draft (section ); public votes in cases of associations of the second and third levels (section ); at the time of elections and plebiscites various formalities must be complied with at the Ministry of Labour (section ).
.The Committee has recalled, with regard to these provisions, that Convention No.  guarantees in particular the rights of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes. The Committee must emphasise once again the importance which it attaches to these standards and to the principle that the public authorities should refrain from any intervention which would limit these -rights or impede their legal exercise.
.The Committee notes with interest that the provision of the previous draft which forbade any reference to politics in the by-laws of the organisations has been modified. Under section  of the draft, only activities which have a preponderantly political character are forbidden. The Committee considers that the conformity of this provision with the principles of freedom of association will depend essentially on the practical application of this provision.
.At various stages in the examination of this case, the Committee has examined allegations concerning the detention of trade unionists and former trade unionists (whose names, and in many cases their trade union functions, had been indicated in the complaints). On several occasions, in particular in May , the Committee attached to its report the information furnished by the Government on the trade unionists concerned. At its sessions of May-June and November , the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation noted the release of a certain number of trade unionists mentioned by the complainants.
.In a letter of May , the WFTU referred to the precarious state of health of two detained trade unionists, Rosario Pietraroia and Gerardo Cuesta. The WFTU also stated that contrary to previous statements by the Government, Oscar Tassino Atz (trade union leader of the AUTE) had disappeared after his arrest on  July , and stated that members of his family witnessed the arrest. The CNT, in a letter of September , stated its concern over the conditions of detention of several trade union leaders (under-nourishment, absence of medical care and inadequate sanitary arrangements, absence of medication, ill-treatment and repression). It cited in particular the case of Rosario Pietraroia who has lost one eye for lack of the necessary care.
.At the beginning of the Committee's November  Session, the Government communicated a certain amount of information on the situation of trade unionists listed in the annex to the Committee's th Report. The Committee proposed to examine this information at its following session. The Governing Body also requested the Government to communicate its observations concerning the allegations relative to the conditions of detention and to the situation of a certain number of arrested trade unionists.
.In its communication of  December , the WFTU again referred to the situation of the metal industry trade union leader, Gerardo Cuesta, detained since , who was sentenced to  years' imprisonment and has been ill treated.
.Regarding Gerardo Cuesta, the Government recalls in its communication of  February  that he was arrested and imprisoned under emergency security measures (section () of the Constitution). He was charged in August  before the military investigating magistrate for subversive activity and violation of the Constitution with ""conspiracy and preparatory action"". Gerardo Cuesta was sentenced to  years' imprisonment in August . The sentence was confirmed in October . Regarding his state of health, the Government states that he suffers from chronic bronchial pneumonia which dates from before his arrest with periodical crises which are supervised and cared for. Nevertheless, his state of health is good. The Government states that Gerardo Cuesta was not sentenced because of his trade union activity.
.In its communication of  January , the Government supplied certain information according to which several of the persons mentioned by the complainants have been released.
.The Committee notes that, according to the information communicated by the Government several trade unionists have been released. It also notes the information provided by the Government regarding Gerardo Cuesta. However, it must express its concern over the fact that several persons mentioned by the complainants are still waiting, and in several cases have been for a considerable time, to be tried by the courts. In this connection, the Committee stresses the importance which it attaches to the principle that any person arrested should be subject to normal judicial procedure and should be brought before the appropriate judge without delay, in accordance with the principles enshrined in the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. In the case of persons who carry out trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which must be assured by the authorities in order to guarantee the effective exercise of trade union rights. The Committee hopes that the Government will continue to supply information on the situation of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants and that it will communicate its observations on the conditions of detention of trade union leaders.
.In its letter of May , the WFTU pointed out that the number of joint Committees actually functioning was far below that indicated by the Government in may  and that the authorities were even trying to hinder their establishment. The complainant mentioned two specific instances (the ""Aurora"" textile factory and the ""Banco Comercial"") and added that in certain cases workers who requested the setting up of such Committees were being subjected to pressure and persecution.
.The WFTU further stated that trade union premises had been closed, thus depriving the trade unions and their leaders of their means of action, and that government",0,1973,Uruguay
102,".The Committee has already examined this case at its sessions in November  and February . In November  it submitted an interim report in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report.
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still outstanding concern the arrest, in August , of Messrs. Julio Guardin, Ofilio Garcia, Antonio Centeno and Francisco Palacios, leaders of the Textile Workers' Union, at the time when a general strike was started in the textile industry. According to the WCL, these persons were still in detention in November  without any specific charge having been brought against them, and it was not known what authority had ordered and maintained their detention. The Government having submitted no information on this aspect of the case, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, at its November  session, to request the Government to indicate as soon as possible the situation concerning the trade union leaders arrested, to state whether they had appeared before a court and, if so, to supply the text of the court findings and the reasons given therefor.
.In this connection the Government stated in its communication of  December  that it was the legal advisers of the firm of Fabritex who, in , had denounced directly to the criminal judiciary the activities of certain persons who, according to the Government, could not be qualified as trade union leaders. It added that the case in question was closed and that it ""understood"" that these persons had been set at liberty long ago.
.At its session in February , the Committee decided to transmit to the complainant organisation the substance of the Government's observations and to invite it to make any comments it wished thereon, on the understanding that the Government would have the opportunity to reply to these comments.
.In a communication dated  June , the WCL confirmed that the persons named in the complaint were no longer in custody. The WCL stated that they had been arrested on the occasion of a general strike called in the textile industry in August . There was absolutely no doubt, continued the complainants, that the leaders of the Textile Workers' Union had spent many long months in prison, and that they had been detained on account of their trade union activities.
.The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which has not furnished any observations upon it.
.The Committee notes that the persons named in the complaint were released long ago. It must observe, however, that the statements of the complainants and of the Government as to the grounds for their arrest are contradictory: according to the WCL, the measures in question were connected with their trade union activities, whereas according to the Government, these persons cannot be qualified as trade union leaders.
.The Committee notes that the persons named in the complaint and claimed by the WCL to be trade union leaders were arrested on the occasion of a general strike in the textile industry. It notes that the Government has given no reasons as to why it considers that these persons are not trade union leaders. The Committee considers that it was incumbent upon the Government to show that the measures taken did not arise out of the trade union activities of the persons in question. In this connection the Committee regrets that the Government has provided no information concerning the legal proceedings instituted against these persons, nor has it furnished the text of the court findings, as requested by the Committee.
.Subject to the reservations expressed in paragraph , and bearing in mind that the persons named were released long ago, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint from the World Confederation of Labour was submitted in a letter of  November . In view of the fact that, despite repeated requests, the Government had not communicated its observations on the complaint, the Committee sent urgent, requests to the Government, in February and in May , to provide the information requested. The Government's observations were received in a communication of  July .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the closing down of the two unions mentioned, and having regard to the considerations set out in paragraph  above, to decide that as these unions were closed down by court order, this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the arrest of the trade union leaders, to request the Government to indicate as soon as possible the present situation concerning the two leaders arrested, to state whether they have appeared before a court and, if so, to supply the text of the court findings and the reasons given therefor;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the information requested from the Government.",0,1973,Nicaragua
103,"activities cause, or might cause, a breach of the peace. With a view to the maintenance of order the Government has had to take the necessary measures for guaranteeing social peace and in particular to order the dissolution of the National Workers' Convention and the arrest and trial of its leaders by the competent criminal court.
.The Government, moreover, takes the view that the allegations of infringement of Conventions Nos.  and  cannot be sustained. While Convention No.  does require the authorities to ""refrain from any interference which would restrict"" the rights of organisations or hamper the legitimate exercise of those rights, it does, on the other hand, lay down that ""in exercising the rights provided for in this Convention workers and employers and their organisations shall respect the law of the land"". The National Workers' Convention, however, has taken the view that its independence and freedom of action are such that it can with impunity overlook the law of the land and even attempt to overturn or destroy it. It has ignored that defence of occupational interests for which trade unions exist in order to uphold certain political interests.
.Certainly, the Government continues, in any democratic society it is almost inevitable that the trade union movement shall be influenced by political parties. But it is essential to avoid a state of affairs in which the movement is used as a tool by some ideology or political faction and takes decisions which do not reflect the will of those who have freely come together in the defence of their interests.
.The observations made in respect of the National Workers' Convention, the Government considers, apply also to the complaints from the Medical Association of Uruguay and the Trade Unions international of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers (concerning the state body ANCAP). Lastly, it affirms that it continues to observe the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and .
.The Governmental Order dated  June , attached to the Government's letter to the ILO, declares the National Workers' Convention to be an unlawful association and decrees its dissolution. The order also decrees the closing of its premises, the attachment of its property, the freezing of all bank deposits in its name or that of any of its officers, and the arrest of these officers. Lastly, officers and members who may have carried out unlawful acts are to be tried by the competent criminal court.
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that the imprisonment of Antonio Tamayo and the searches carried out for Enrique Pastorino are in no way related to their holding of union office. The Government says that the arrest of Antonio Tamayo was ordered by the executive authority pursuant to the declaration of a state of emergency (section () of the Constitution), and that it is because he is presumed to have engaged in subversive activities harmful to the security of the State that Enrique Pastorino is being sought. In a more recent communication, dated  January , the Government states that Mr. Tamayo was set free at the end of December .
.The Committee takes note of the Governments observations, and in particular of the fact that Antonio Tamayo has been set free. As regards the arrest of the other trade union leaders, the Committee notes that according to the Government they will be tried by an appropriate criminal court. It observes, however, that the Government does not indicate in its comments the present position regarding the detained persons or whether they have been brought to trial. As far as Enrique Pastorino is concerned, the Government does not provide details on the nature of the acts of which he is accused.
.In such cases, the Committee has always emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the government considers have no relation to their trade union functions or activities. Whenever the Committee has come to the conclusion, in the light of the information available, that the accused have been fairly tried by a proper court, have had the benefit of a regular judicial procedure and have been condemned for acts having nothing to do with ordinary trade union activities, it has ruled that the case did not call for further consideration. It has, however, emphasised that the question whether such a matter relates to a criminal offence or to the exercise of trade union rights is not one which can be determined unilaterally by the government concerned, but that it is for the Committee itself to decide on the point after an examination of all available evidence, especially the text of the judicial proceedings.
.As regards the dissolution, by decree, of the National Workers' Convention, the Committee once more emphasises the importance it attaches to the principle set forth in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), - ratified by Uruguay - according to which workers' organisations may not be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority. As the Committee has pointed out in other cases, dissolution by the Executive in virtue of a law conferring full powers or in the exercise of legislative functions, like dissolution by administrative authority, does not ensure the right of defence which normal judicial procedure alone can guarantee and which the Committee considers to be essential.
.The Committee has also taken note of the allegations concerning the ban on the activities of the Glass Workers' Federation and the Sole Union of Building and Allied Trades Workers, as well as the measures taken against several teachers' organisations. It has not yet received any comments from the Government with regard to these allegations.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with reference to the alleged arrest of trade union leaders(i) to take note of the Government's statement that Antonio Tamayo was set free in December ;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above and especially to the principle that whenever trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions or activities, they should be given a prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal;(iii) to request the Government to state whether proceedings have been instituted against all these trade unionists and, if so, the nature of the court dealing with the case and the stage the proceedings have reached and to supply copies of the judgements, once they are rendered, with the grounds adduced therefor;(b) as regards the alleged dissolution by decree of the National Workers' Convention to draw the attention of the Government to the importance it attaches to the principle that workers' organisations should not be subject to dissolution by administrative authority, and that likewise dissolution by the executive branch of the Government does not ensure the right of defence which normal judicial procedure alone can guarantee;(c) to request the Government to furnish its observations on the alleged ban on activities by the Glass Workers' Federation and the Sole Union of Building and Allied Trades Workers and on the measures taken against several teachers' organisations;(d) to request the Government to be good enough to send precise information on the nature of the acts of which Enrique Pastorino is accused;(e) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report to the Governing Body as soon as it receives the information requested from the Government.
.The complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants are contained in five communications dated  July,  July,  July,  July and  September  from the World Federation of Trade Unions; two communications from the world Confederation of Labour dated  July and  September ; one communication from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries dated  August ; one communication from the Trade Unions International of Chemical, oil and Allied Workers dated  September ; two communications from the Medical Association of Uruguay addressed on  July  to the United Nations and transmitted by the latter to the ILO; this complaint is supported by the World Medical Association in two communications of  and  August . The World Federation of Teachers' Unions sent its complaint in a communication dated  October .
.In view of the allegations formulated by the World Federation of Trade Unions in its first two communications the complaint was transmitted in two letters and one telegram indicating that this was a case considered urgent in accordance with the procedure in force. All the other complaints were submitted to the Government as they were received so that the Government might send its observations as rapidly as possible.
.No reply has been received from the Government to date.
.Uruguay has",0,1973,Uruguay
104,"ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances and for the case as a whole the Committee recommends to the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern at the allegations in the various complaints, with respect to which it regrets not having received the Government's reply in spite of a considerable lapse of time;(b) to request the Government to be kind enough to send its comments on the various allegations made against it as quickly as possible;(c) without coming to a decision on the substance of the allegations at the present time, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set out in paragraphs ,  and  above and in particular(i) to the importance which it attaches to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions;(ii) to the importance which it attaches to the principle consecrated explicitly in Article  of Convention No. , which Uruguay has ratified, according to which employers' and workers' organisations should not be subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a new report to the Governing Body when it has received the information requested from the Government.",0,1973,Uruguay
105,"bodies had occupied the premises in question. The WFTU mentioned the case of the National Trade Union of Construction Workers and Allied Trades (SUNCA), whose premises had apparently become the barracks of the grenadier guards, of the National Union of Workers in the Metal and Allied Trades (UNTMICA) whose premises had apparently become the headquarters of Police section , of the National Workers' Convention (CNT), whose premises had apparently become a centre for the women police of Montevideo (and whose equipment was being used by Department No.  of the police), the case of the Meat Workers' Federation, the use of whose premises had been requested by the Montevideo police commissioner of Section No. , the case of the Federation of Primary Schoolteachers' Unions and that of the secondary Schoolteachers' Trade Union, whose premises had also apparently become paramilitary installations.
.The WFTU emphasised that all trade union activities had been suppressed six years before, and that the experience with joint commissions had been negative. It drew particular attention to the numerous dismissals continuously, taking place on the basis of Institutional Act No.  ( members of the staff of the Clnicas Hospital were thus dismissed in January ). The WFTU concluded that these dilatory tactics, used in expectation of the complete suppression of all attempts at free trade union activity, showed the illusory character of the promise of trade union freedom.
.For its part, the CRT alleged in a letter of September , that the police headquarters of Montevideo had notified the Association of Bank Employees of Uruguay (AEBU) on  July  that its legal personality was ""without effect"", in accordance with Decree No. / of  August . The complainant added that the deduction from wages of the trade union dues of the AEBU members had been discontinued. It also quoted a decision of the Ministry of the Interior (dated  July ) ordering the president of AEBU to hand over within  days to the National Office of Information and Research a list of members of a new governing board consisting of persons having no ""adverse past records"", so that the authorities could, upon request, later allow artistic and cultural events to take place under the supervision of the above-mentioned National Office. The CRT further alleged that pressure was being exerted on the workers, even those who were under arrest, to make them join together in a nationalist trade union. At the time of the Committee's November  Session, the Government had not yet replied to these new allegations. The Governing Body then requested the Government to transmit its observations on these points. The Government has still not replied to the allegations in question.
.In its communication of  January , the Government supplies comments on these various allegations. The Committee intends to examine them at its next session.
.As regards the case as a whole, more generally, the Committee has empowered its chairman to examine with the representatives of the Government of Uruguay at the Governing Body the most appropriate means of arriving at a rapid and satisfactory solution of the questions raised.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the draft Act on occupational associations:(i) to note with concern that the draft differs only slightly from the earlier draft which the Committee examined at its May  Session;(ii) to draw the Government's attention yet again to the principles and considerations set out in paragraphs  to  above regarding provisions on the free establishment of trade unions, the conditions of eligibility of trade union leaders and the regulation of various aspects of the internal administration of trade unions;(iii) to express the firm hope that these principles and considerations will be taken into account in the final text of the Act;(iv) to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of any development in the matter;(b) regarding the detention of trade unionists:(i) to note with interest that certain trade unionists have been released;(ii) nevertheless to express its concern over the fact that certain persons are waiting, in some cases for a considerable time, to be tried by the courts and to call the attention of the Government to the principles set out in paragraph , in particular the principle according to which all persons arrested should be subject to normal judicial procedure and should be brought before the appropriate judge without delay;(iii) to request the Government to continue to supply information on the situation of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants;(c) to note that the Government has just supplied certain comments regarding the other allegations and that the Committee intends to examine them at its next session;(d) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.For a number of years, the Committee has had occasion to examine several complaints dealing with different aspects of the trade union situation in the country. It has stressed the abnormal character of this situation for the Uruguayan trade union movement as a whole, ever since the change of regime which took place in June . It is a fact that Uruguayan trade unions cannot carry out the activities proper to such unions because their recognition by the authorities and by the employers hinges upon their legal status - and that status has not yet been defined by law: they thus have an existence in fact but not legally.
.The Government has referred on more than one occasion to the subversive activities which it had to face, in order to explain the exceptional measures adopted, particularly in regard to trade unions. The Committee has recalled, in this connection, the need to avoid confusing the performance by trade unions of their own specific activities, that is to say the defence and promotion of the professional interests of the workers, with the possible conduct by some of their members of other activities, foreign to the trade union field. The liability at penal law which might attach to these persons as a result of such acts should in no case lead to measures calculated to deprive the trade unions themselves, or their leaders as a body, of their freedom of action. The Government has also stated that the process of normalisation in the trade union field must be viewed in the wider framework of the political and institutional normalisation of the country as a whole. In this connection, the Committee has stressed that while it is true that the respect of trade union freedom is closely connected with the respect of public liberties in general, it is important, subject to that reservation, to draw a clear distinction between the recognition of freedom of association on the one hand and questions relating to the political evolution of the country concerned on the other. The trade union legislation of a country and the reform of its political institutions are two totally distinct questions.
.The Committee has examined the preliminary draft of the law on professional associations, the text of which had been forwarded to it by the Government. It notes that this text contains some positive aspects, but it has formulated observations concerning a number of other provisions of the draft which do not seem compatible with some of the principles of freedom of association, on the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, at its session of May-June , took note of the Government's statement to the effect that these observations will be taken into consideration in the preparation of the final text of the draft to be submitted to the Council of State and that the Government was carrying out consultations on this draft with worker and employer organisations. The Governing Body stressed how important it was that the law thus being drafted should be promulgated very shortly and that its final text should be in complete harmony with the rules embodied in ILO Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Uruguay. It urged the Government to indicate the date on which it expects the final text of the law to be adopted and applied, and to provide all further information on any developments which may occur in the matter.
.The Committee has moreover stressed its concern, especially in view of the situation described above, regarding the detention of many trade unionists (whose names, and often also trade union functions, had been indicated in the complaints). On several occasions, and particularly in may , the Committee has given, in an annex to its report, the information supplied by the Government on the trade unionists concerned. At its May-June  session the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee:
.In its letter of  May  the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) points out, in the first place, that the number of joint commissions actually functioning is far below that indicated by the Government in May  and that, at present, the authorities even try to hinder their setting up. The complainant mentions two specific instances (the ""Aurora"" textile factory and the ""Banco Comercial"") and adds that in certain",0,1973,Uruguay
106,"Workers' Convention.
.As regards the first set of allegations, the complainant organisations stated that numerous arrests had taken place and gave the names of some of the persons detained, and in particular: Antonio Tamayo, a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention and a representative of the Uruguayan workers at the International Labour Conference (th Session), arrested on his return from the Conference; Flix Diaz, another leading figure in the Convention; Mario Acosta, General Secretary of the Building Workers' Federation and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of Workers in the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries; Daniel Baldassari, General Secretary of the Petroleum Workers' Federation and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of chemical, oil and Allied Workers; Dr. Manuel Liberoff, Treasurer of the Medical Association of Uruguay, and five other leading figures in the Union: Juan J. Ormaechea, Nestor Figari, Alberto Cassamayou, Sergio Assandri and Carlos Buscato; and Victor Brindisi, General Secretary of the Teachers' Federation, a regional delegate of the Confederation of Latin-American Teachers and a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention.
.The World Federation of Trade Unions alleged further that sixty trade union leaders were being sought by the police, including Jose d'Elia, President, and Vladimir Turiansky, Vice-President of the National Workers' Convention, and Enrique Pastorino, President of the WFTU. In all some , workers have been arrested and threatened with trial by military courts, according to the WFTU. The latter also provided a list of  arrested trade union leaders, and the WCL sent a list (which it describes as incomplete) of  persons arrested.
.The WFTU, the WCL and the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries further complained that the National Workers' Convention had been dissolved by decree. The decree in question, which was issued on  June , gave as the reason for dissolution the attitude of the leaders of the Convention, who were said to have encouraged and defended the use of violence and urged workers to occupy their workplaces thereby obstructing public services and supplies.
.When the Committee considered the case at its session in November , it recommended that the Governing Body, without expressing a view as to the substance of the matter, should express its concern at these allegations and remind the Government that the Committee had always emphasised the importance which it attached to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists were charged with political or criminal offences which the government considered had no relation to their trade union functions, and the importance which it attached to the generally accepted principle (set out in Convention No. , ratified by Uruguay) that workers' organisations should not be subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority.
.In its communication dated  October , the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers stated that on  June  the Uruguayan authorities, with support from the armed forces, brutally broke up a strike by the oil workers, members of an affiliated trade union organisation, and placed the ANCAP refinery under military control. The headquarters of the trade union concerned had been closed and its meeting outlawed. Furthermore, the President of that union, Jonds Stneri, had been arrested and a warrant had been issued for the arrests of Daniel Baldassari, General Secretary, and of the Secretary-Treasurer. Moreover, the other Uruguayan affiliated organisation - the Glass Workers' Federation - had allegedly been prevented from exercising its normal activities.
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions, in a communication dated  November , asserts that the Uruguayan Government is continuing its repression of unionised teachers. The premises of teachers' unions have been broken into, typewriters and mimeograph machines destroyed and documents and records confiscated. It also claims that Victor Cayota, President of the Secondary School Teachers' Federation, has been imprisoned.
.In a communication dated  November , the World Confederation of Labour provides a list (stated to be incomplete) of trade union leaders in custody for nearly five months. Apart from certain leaders already referred to, the following were being held in the Army Ordnance and Services College: Roberto Olmos, General Secretary, Trade Union of Graphic Arts; Hctor Betancourt, a leading figure in the Transport Federation; Honorio Libner, a leader of the National Workers' Convention and Chairman of the National Federation of Municipal Employees; Aparcicio Guzmn, a leader of the Trade Union of Graphic Arts; and Rubn Villaverde, a leading figure in the National Workers' Convention and the Federation of State Water and Sewerage Workers. The complainants also alleged that many workers were still locked up in barracks, the Montevideo police headquarters and the ""Cilindro Municipal"" Sports Stadium; some of their names are given. None of these persons had been sentenced or even brought to trial. Their only offence was to have defended the Constitution and freedom of association. The complainants concluded by asking the ILO to secure the immediate release of the trade union leaders and workers who were kept in gaol ""so as to stifle the free and democratic trade union movement"".
.In a communication dated  December , the Latin American Federation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries claimed that its affiliate in Uruguay, the Sole Union of Building and Allied Trades Workers, had had its headquarters forcibly occupied by troops, its funds confiscated and its meetings prohibited.
.In a communication received by the ILO, on  November , the Government of Uruguay explained why it had arrested trade union leaders and dissolved the National Workers' Convention; in support of its comments, it enclosed an order approved by the Government on  June .
.The Government begins by declaring that it has for some considerable time been making every effort to devise a solution for the country's problems which, while offering the advantages of equity, would be in the best interests of the workers themselves. To this end it has held numerous direct talks with the various branches of the labour force, patiently encouraged constructive discussions among all Uruguayan organisations of employers and workers, proposed the creation of joint advisory Committees and suggested improvements in wages and working conditions. Many trade union organisations, and the vast majority of Uruguayan workers, have been very favourably impressed by these activities and the motives behind them.
.However, the Government continues, the National Workers' Convention, led by totalitarian extremists from minority groups, has opposed the Government's policy. It has refused recognition of the right to work, championed violence, promoted the unlawful occupation of workplaces, both public and private, called for sabotage, encouraged continuous and very serious street disturbances, done its best to stop the flow of supplies to the people and tried to paralyse public services - indeed, work of any kind anywhere. It has been a matter, in the Government's view, not of a strike, but of the activities of certain fanatically anti-democratic minority groups which had pushed the National Workers' Convention into the action described as a means of producing social chaos and a change in the political, economic and social life of the nation. The violent opposition of the Convention to the authorities was not, according to the Government, due to trade union motives; it was obviously political, the prime aim being to destroy current institutions.
.The Government states that recourse to violence cannot be admitted in any organised society and must be rejected absolutely. In this connection it notes that section () of the Uruguayan Constitution lays down the suspension of civic rights for participation in political or social organisations which attempt to destroy the foundations of the national community either by violence or by propaganda advocating violence.
.The Government recalls further that section  of the Uruguayan Constitution entitles persons to associate for any purpose provided the association is not unlawful. Among the forms of unlawful association defined by Act No.  of  July  is that which advocates violence against the institutions of the Republic or against the civil authorities. Section  of the Act provides that such associations shall be dissolved and that their leaders and members participating in such activities shall be charged under the criminal law.
.These provisions, the Government adds, clearly show that the National Workers' Convention has become an unlawful association in the above sense. Its activities could, under the Criminal Code, constitute rebellion, riotous assembly, public incitement to break the law and commit criminal acts, promotion of class hatred and contempt of the public authorities. It is for the criminal courts to define the offences and the criminal responsibility of the members and officers of the organisation.
.The Government's conduct in the present case has, it states, been justified in that under the Constitution it is responsible for keeping the peace and for taking prompt and vigorous action in the event of grave and unforeseen disturbance (section ,  and ). Moreover, section  of Act No.  of  July  empowers the Government to suspend meetings or activities in all premises, public or private, when such meetings or",0,1973,Uruguay
107,"that the accused was being tried solely for offences under the ordinary law and that only the courts were competent to judge whether the accused was guilty or innocent. If there were any doubts as to the responsibility of Mr. Palomino for the offences of which he had been charged, he could still, under article  of the Constitution, be imprisoned since the probability of responsibility was sufficient to entail imprisonment.
.The Government states that if these persons were convicted of offences under the common law the corresponding penalty would be imposed. There existed, however, a right of appeal against sentence.
.In connection with the trial of Samuel Snchez Torres before the First District Court of the state of Michoacn in Morelia, the Government transmits certified court documents for examination by the Committee. The Committee notes from these documents that this person was imprisoned on charges of resistance to due process of law, contravention of section  of the Federal Water Act, damage to property and theft.
.The Committee has pointed out on a number of occasions' that in cases of allegations relating to the prosecution and sentencing of trade union leaders the only question to be decided is the real reason for the measures complained of being taken, and only if these measures have been taken by reason of legitimate trade union activities can there be any infringement of freedom of association. Furthermore, in all cases in which trade union leaders are preventively detained, these measures may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and the Committee has always emphasised the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment.
.The Committee has taken note of the detailed explanations supplied by the Government concerning the arrest, detention and trial of the two trade union leaders mentioned in the complaint, and of the precise charges brought against them by the authorities. In the case of Mr. Ramn Danzs Palomino, these charges relate to the forcible occupation of lawfully owned land, unlawful association, illegal possession of arms, resistance to due process of law and incitement to crime; in the case of Mr. Samuel Snchez Torres the charges relate to an offence under the Federal Water Act, resistance to due process of law, damage to property and theft. The information supplied by the Government in connection with the offences with which the above persons were charged is substantiated by the court documents transmitted by the Government. In addition, the persons concerned were brought to trial within a reasonable period and the Committee is satisfied that the accused appear at all times to have had the benefit of all rights available under the normal judicial procedure. The Committee also considers that the charges against the trade union leaders concerned, and which led to their arrest and imprisonment, do not relate to acts which could be considered to be normal trade union activities. Accordingly, the action of the authorities in arresting detaining and subsequently bringing these persons before the courts did not, in the opinion of the Committee, constitute an infringement of trade union rights.
.In all these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraph  above, that the case does not call for further consideration.",-1,1973,Mexico
108,".The complaint of the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers is contained in a communication dated  December . This complaint was duly transmitted to the Government which submitted its observations in three communications dated  February,  April and  May  respectively.
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication dated  December , the complainants state that, on  July , a large group of police arrested at his home, Ramn Danzs Palomino, Secretary-General of the Independent Peasants' Union and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers. According to the complainants, he was taken from Mexico City to the prison at Atlixco in the state of Puebla where he was charged with ""occupation of land and incitement to crime"". The complainants add that although bail of , pesos was paid, another case with the same charges was brought against Ramn Danzs Palomino at Tecamachalco, which is also in the state of Puebla.
.The complainants state that the judges refused to merge these two cases, a fact which, they state, could lead to the accused being kept in prison for a long time. This suspicion, continue the complainants, is strengthened by a report from Mexico that the judicial authorities in other states are bringing similar charges against the accused.
.The complainants explain that the charges against Danzs Palomino are based on assertions that some peasants, having been expelled from the land they had occupied and on being arrested by the army, admitted belonging to an organisation headed by Palomino. The complainants add that certain statements made by Palomino in speeches also led to his arrest. According to the complainants, Palomino has been arrested and charged several times in his capacity as peasant leader. The complainants allege that these arrests constitute flagrant violations of trade union freedom and of citizen's rights. The complainants made a number of requests to the President of the United States of Mexico to expedite the release of Palomino; they add however that up to the date of lodging the complaint they have only received an acknowledgement of their last letter which was dated  September .
.The complainants add that another leader of the Independent Peasants' Union, Samuel Snchez-Torres, is in prison at Morelia on account of his trade union activities, and fifteen other peasants are in prison at Atlixco and Tecamachalco.
.In its first communication in reply to the allegations, dated  February , the Government confirmed that Ramn Danzs Palomino was imprisoned in the municipal prison at Atlixco in the state of Puebla, charged with abusive occupation of land, incitement to crime and resistance to due process of law. The Government added that investigation of the case had revealed a number of prima facie offences not mentioned by the complainants. According to the Government, before Ramn Danzs Palomino was arrested, proceedings had already been brought against him by one Esteban Schiavan Braccinni on  July . This Braccinni, Mexican by birth, had complained to the representative of the Ministry of the Interior for the Atlixco district that a group of peasants had illegally taken over a plot of land called Xaxalpa, of which he, Braccinni, was the legal owner, as could be seen from the contract of purchase entered into with Maria Ofelia Fernndez Ruiz de Calles and dated  June . The plaintiff stated that from the date in question he had been peacefully and usefully farming the plot in question, and indeed possessed a certificate of inalienability, No. ,, delivered by the Department of Agriculture on  July . The Government explains that, in Mexico, there coexist what is known as the ""ejido"" (common land), and small private property. The small landowner farming his land in accordance with the law can obtain a certificate of inalienability to protect him from any future apportionment of land. A group of peasants, the Government continues, led by Ramn Danzs Palomino, invaded the plot known as Xaxalpa. They were armed with machetes, but did not, it seems, intend to attack the owner. Apparently they wanted to create a de facto situation which would force the owner to negotiate with them. This being so, and in view of the complaint already lodged the authorities decided to enforce the law and maintain the peace and ordered the arrest of Ramn Danzs Palomino.
.The Government stated that because the Constitution guarantees freedom of association and opinion, there is no ban on the Independent Peasants' Union and other extremist associations; nor are they persecuted in any way. Thus, the Independent Peasants' Union has many agencies throughout Mexico, where meetings are organised; these latter could sometimes be described as violent, since attacks are launched therein against Mexican institutions, the Government and private individuals. Nevertheless, those who organise such meetings are never molested by the authorities, unless their conduct goes beyond the norms established by Mexican criminal law.
.The Government explained that, owing to the division of powers in Mexico, the Executive Power (i.e. the Government) was unable to pronounce on the criminal responsibility of Danzos Palomino and his co-accused, these proceedings being sub judice. It would be for the courts to decide whether accused are guilty or not of the charges brought against them. The Government stated, however, that it was in a position to give an assurance that the accused enjoyed all the guarantees set forth in article  of the Federal Constitution.
.The Government considered that there was no foundation for the complaint lodged by the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers. Ramn Danzs Palomino and the other accused were being tried in exactly the same way as any other persons against whom similar charges are brought, and it was for the courts to decide whether or not the accused were guilty of any offence.
.In its further communication dated  April , the Government transmitted copies of documents relating to Case No. / of the Civil and Social Defence Court in Atlixco, concerning Ramn Danzs Palomino and other persons charged with him.
.As for Mr. Samuel Snchez Torres, a leader of the Independent Peasants' Union, the Government stated that he was being held at the disposal of the First District Judge, at Morelia, Michoacn, for contravening section  of the Federal Water Act having deliberately displaced a hydrant belonging to the State. He seriously damaged the said hydrant and also caused considerable damage to crops in the area. The Government added that section  of the above-mentioned Act is worded in the following terms: ""Any person who harms or destroys hydraulic equipment belonging to the nation shall be liable to imprisonment for one to ten years and to a fine corresponding to the amount of the damage caused."" Mr. Snchez Torres was also at the disposal of the judge for stealing padlocks and other movable parts of the said hydrant belonging to the Hydraulic Resources Department. The case had now reached the stage where evidence was being submitted by the defence counsel chosen by Mr. Snchez Torres. At the end of this stage, judgment would be passed. The Government explained that the documents in the case, together with the committal order which had been issued on  June , constituted a very bulky file, but the Secretariat of the Court of the First Instance of Morelia would forward to the Governing Body Committee on Freedom of Association, as soon as possible, certified copies thereof.
.In its latest communication, dated  May , the Government states that the judge of the Court of First Instance in Atlixco, Puebla, had confirmed that Mr. Palomino is imprisoned in that city for the offence of abusive occupation of land, unlawful association, the illegal possession of arms, incitement to crime and resistance to due process of law in the jurisdiction of Tecamachalco. The Government adds that Mr. Palomino committed similar offences in Atlixco, Puebla, and that although he had been released on bail, he had still to be tried. Since there is no prison in Tecamachalco the judge had requested his counterpart in Atlixco to keep Palomino in prison there. The Government goes on to explain that, under article  of the Mexican Constitution, offenders in preventive detention must be separated from those actually serving sentences; they do not necessarily have to be kept in a prison in the area in which the offence was committed, but in a place to be determined by the competent authority.
.According to the Government the offences committed in Atlixco and Tecamachalco differed in character. In the former, Palomino had incited a group of persons to take possession of land by force, this land being lawfully owned, whereas in the latter he had incited persons in speeches to commit offences of an openly subversive nature, by taking the law into their own hands. These, state the Government, are offences punishable by the Constitution and by the Penal Code. The Government adds",0,1973,Mexico
109,".In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adopt the present report, and in particular the following conclusions:The Committee notes that a direct contacts mission took place in Uruguay in January .In relation to the trade union legislation, the Committee notes the adoption on  May  of the Occupational Associations Act, and observes with satisfaction that following direct contacts important improvements have been introduced to the provisions of the Bill, on which the Committee had made comments. Thus, the Committee notes that the following provisions of the Bill were deleted: the obligation to make a declaration of ""democratic faith"" in order to be eligible as a trade union leader; the obligatory voting in elections and plebiscites; the limitation of the maximum duration of trade union assemblies; the obligatory organisation of a plebiscite to examine draft collective agreements and in other cases provided for by regulations; and suspension of membership of those who have not taken part in a vote. The Committee also notes that the new Act limits the broad powers of the authorities to require reports on trade union activities, and that the lower-level trade unions are not responsible for decisions taken by higher-level organisations to which they are affiliated. The Committee trusts that the Government will take measures to ensure that the legislation will recognise explicitly the possibility of forming occupational associations at the occupational and the industrial levels, and to repeal the requirement, in certain cases, of two years' membership of a trade union as a condition of eligibility to trade union office. The Committee trusts also that the regulations to be issued under the Act will be in full conformity with the obligations arising under the freedom of association Conventions ratified by Uruguay and that other legislative measures will deal with the exercise of the right to strike and will ensure the protection of trade union leaders against any act of anti-union discrimination. The Committee draws the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case, so that it may continue to examine it.In relation to the detentions alleged by the complainants, the Committee notes with interest that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainant have already been released, and that during the last few years the number of detainees has been reduced, as has - to a marked extent - the number of new detentions followed by prosecution. Nevertheless, the Committee must also note that in almost all the cases the defence was entrusted to a member of the military. When the representative of the Director-General referred to appeals, he stated that a slight tendency to increase the sentences handed down at first instance could be noted.In view of the time which has elapsed since the majority of the detainees and convicted persons were deprived of their freedom, the Committee considers that their release would be a necessary condition for the harmonious development of labour relations. It therefore requests the Government to take measures for the release of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants still in prison and asks the Government to keep it informed of any measures taken in this regard.As regards the other allegations:The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that assets of dissolved organisations should be distributed between the members of the organisation or transferred to the organisations which succeed them.The Committee asks the Government to re-examine the situation of the workers dismissed in January  from the Clnicas Hospital, with a view to reinstating those whose dismissal was based on trade union activities.The Committee trusts that, the occupational Associations Act having been approved, the AEBU, as well as the rest of the organisations concerned, will be able to regain legal personality shortly.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, chairman.
.In its previous examinations of the case, the Committee has stressed the abnormal character of the situation for the Uruguayan trade union movement as a whole since the change of regime which took place in June . Uruguayan trade unions cannot carry out the activities proper to such unions because their recognition by the authorities and by the employers hinges upon their legal status - and that status has not yet been defined by law: they thus have an existence in fact but not legally.
.The Committee had examined the preliminary draft of the law on occupational associations, the text of which had been forwarded to it by the Government. It noted that this text contained some positive aspects, but it formulated observations concerning a number of other provisions of the draft which did not seem compatible with certain principles of freedom of association, On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, at its session of May-June , took note of the Government's statement to the effect that these observations would be taken into consideration in the preparation of the final text of the draft to be submitted to the Council of State and that the Government was carrying out consultations on this draft with worker and employer organisations.
.At its November  Session, the Committee noted, in particular, that the comments made by the ILO supervisory organs were being examined, that the final draft of the Act was due to be submitted to the Council of State by  December  and that the Government would suggest that it be examined rapidly. The Committee reiterated that, after six years of serious restrictions upon trade union activities, there was a very urgent need to promulgate and implement legislation which recognises the right for all workers, without any distinction whatsoever, to set up occupational organisations and the right of these organisations to function and operate freely, in accordance with the various Conventions on freedom of association. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation:- expressed the firm hope that this draft, in its final version, would be in full conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  which have been ratified by Uruguay, urged the Government to adopt it in the very near future and asked the Government to give the date on which it was envisaged that it would be promulgated;- asked the Government to send the draft Act once it was submitted to the Council of State and to supply information on any developments which might take place.
.In its communication of  December , the Government informed the International Labour Office of the publication on  December  in the Official Journal, of the message by which the executive branch submitted the draft law on occupational associations to the Council of State. The Government draws attention to the importance attached, in its message to the Council of State, to the rapid examination of the draft so that the situation of occupational associations could be regularised as soon as possible. It attached to its communication the text of the message and of the draft.
.The CNT and the WFTU have made allegations concerning the draft in their communications of  January and  February , respectively. They refer in particular to the provisions concerning the conditions of eligibility of trade union leaders, the by-laws of organisations and the grounds for refusal of registration. The CNT considers that, having compared this draft with the previous one, which the Committee has already examined, the present draft is even more negative for trade union organisations.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that the ILO's comments on the draft law were examined most attentively and as a matter of high priority. In this connection, the Government recalls that it included in the guidelines of the draft the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations. It also notes that in the draft the absolute restriction upon the exercise of political activities has been weakened. The Government states that in relation to the Committee's suggestions which have not been incorporated into the draft, they only concerned different interpretations and not non-performance of Convention No.
.While examining the complainants' allegations, the Government states that the Ministry of Labour and Social Security is at present examining the draft law on the exercise of the right to strike. The Government also notes that even if they are not covered by the Legislative Decree, civil servants enjoy the right to form trade unions, particularly under the terms of the Public Service Act of .
.Regarding the right to form organisations without previous authorisation, the Government notes that the International Court of Justice has given no interpretation on this point and therefore this question remains open to discussion. Referring to the principles already set out by the Committee, the Government states that it shares the opinion of the Committee on this point. According to the Government, the draft does not give discretionary power to public authorities regarding legislation of trade unions. The possible reasons for refusal of registration are defined in the draft, and, in addition, any decision by the administrative authority can be appealed before the courts.
.Finally, the Government states that its reply does",0,1973,Uruguay
110,"taking an active part in trade unions. It also draws attention to the distressing situation of the trade union leaders who have sought refuge in foreign embassies in Santiago and to whom the authorities refuse to grant the safe-conducts without which they cannot leave. Finally, the WCL draws attention to the Government's intention to transform the labour movement into a tool of the rgime through the establishment of trade unions dedicated to its support.
.In its letter of  January  the WFTU alleges that the Chilean authorities have sacked trade union premises and abolished the rights of assembly, organisation, petition and strike. The WFTU appends to its communication a copy of Circular No.  from the minister of the Interior, which lays down that trade union meetings shall take place only after prior authorisation and in the presence of a member of the state police, and provides for the removal by administrative procedures of trade union leaders who are active in those parties which have been declared illegal.
.The WFTU submits a list of trade union officers said to have been executed. It names Ivn Gordillo, leader in the Antofagasta branch of the CUTCH; Almonacid, secretary of the O'Higgins branch of the CUTCH; Hctor Rojo, Samuel Nez, Armando Jimnez, Guillermo Alvarez, trade union leaders of the San Antonio stevedores; Isidoro Carrillo, Bernab Cabrera, Vladimir Araneda, coal workers at Lots; Luis Valdivia and Luis Mamani, union officers at Calama; Ricardo Garca, a worker who was acting as head of the ""Cobre-Sal"" mine, and five union leaders of this undertaking; Hctor Martnez Molina, agricultural workers' leader; and Manuel Donoso, a professor and teachers' leader in Arica. The WFTU adds that Lus Norabuena, CUTCH leader, would seem to have died as a result of beating by the military. Danile Vergara, a trade union leader, allegedly died on Dawson Island as a result of torture. Further, the WFTU states that the following trade union leaders, who have sought refuge in embassies, have been refused safe-conducts; Lus Figueroa, Rolando Caldern (wounded within the confines of an embassy and at present in a military hospital), Jorge Godoy, Fidelma Allende, Mireya Baltra, Hernn del Canto, Eduardo Rojas and Lus Guzmn. According to the WFTU thousands of workers are incarcerated in prisons and concentration camps. It names Lina Bentez, member of the Santiago Provincial Committee of the CUTCH and Lucila Lortsch, a leader of the Chilean University Office Workers' Association. Finally the WFTU states that many workers, estimated at about , have lost their jobs because of their trade union activities. In a subsequent communication, dated  February , the WFTU alleges that by reason of the strike of harbour workers in Puerto Montt, the trade union leader, Elpidio Gonzlez was taken into custody and is to be tried by a military tribunal on charges of sabotage and incitement to strike.
.In a communication dated  December , the Government comments on the WFTU's statement to the effect that Lina Bentez had been condemned to death. The Government denies the truth of this assertion, and states that Lina Bentez is in prison awaiting trial. In another communication, dated  December, the Government states that Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, formerly General Secretary of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers, is neither in prison nor being tried; he is in fact a refugee in a foreign embassy.
.The Government has sent two new communications dated  and  February . In the latter the Government replies in detail to the various allegations made by the complainants and sends a series of documents as evidence of its statements.
.The Government refers first of all to the situations of various persons mentioned in the complaints. Ernesto Vogel Ramrez and Aldo Ramaciotti Nolli declare that they have not been detained or interrogated by the new authorities. Tucapel Jimnez Alfaro states that he has not been disturbed either at home or at his work. Gilberto Garca Aravena says that he has been neither detained nor questioned about his activities in the CUTCH. Ernesto Vogel was Vice-President of the CUTCH and continues to be President of the Industrial Federation of Railways in Chile. Aldo Ramaciotti is a member of the Executive Council of the National Federation of Housing Workers. Tucapel Jimnez is a leader of the National Revenue Workers' Association and First Vice-President of the Interim Executive of the National Central Workers' Organisation, which was established in December .
.The Government goes on in its report to refer to the following persons: Jorge Godoy, formerly Minister of Labour, has sought asylum in the Swedish Embassy; Rolando Caldern Arnguiz, in whose regard the Government mistakenly stated that he was in custody on Dawson Island, has sought asylum in the Cuban Embassy, now under the protection of the Government of Sweden. He was wounded by a shot fired at close range within the confines of the Embassy. After being treated in the Military Hospital, he re-entered the Swedish Embassy. Eduardo Rojas Cuellar has not been sought by the police and is in the Finnish Embassy. Luis Guzmn Robinson has taken refuge in the Embassy of Argentina and since gone to that country. Fidelma Allende Miranda is in the Finnish Embassy. Roberto Prieto, a Uruguayan national, took refuge in the Swedish Embassy, and subsequently after his expulsion from Chile, went to Sweden. Benedicto Cergueira da Silva, a Brazilian, sought asylum in the Embassy of Panama and then went to that country. Lina Bentez alas Line Kleovan was detained for supposed criminal acts and then set free. Manuel Dinamarca Figueroa has been neither detained nor tried. Juan Ponce Ferrada has not been detained, having gone to Moscow on  June . Patricio Gonzlez Verdugo is entirely free. Lus Figueroa Mazuela is a refugee in the Swedish Embassy.
.The Government then refers to the situation of various trade union organisations mentioned in the complaints. The Government states that the Chilean Private Non-Manual Workers' Confederation, the Industrial Mining Federation, the Federation of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, the Revenue Workers' Association, the National Association of Municipal Workers, the National Health Service Professional and Technical Staff Union, the National Federation of Health Workers, the National Federation of Textile Workers and the National Leather and Footwear Workers' Federation, have their own executives and are functioning. The Chilean Copper Miners' Confederation gave itself a new national executive in December , on which the Communist, Socialist and Christian Democrat parties are represented. The ""Ranquil"" National Federation of Agricultural and Indigenous Workers has legal personality and full capacity to act in law. As regards the Single National Union of Workers in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Laboratories and Related Branches (SUTRAL) the majority of organisers in this association have given up activities in it and the leaders of the unions which have formed the Single National Union are now attempting to revive the two existing federations of manual and non-manual laboratory workers.
.The Government replies to the allegation relating to the strike in the Santiago Underground and states that of the  workers dismissed,  were taken on again and  deprived of their jobs. Of the latter only one has appealed to the Courts.
.The Government goes on to refer to various allegations and charges concerning legislation enacted by the new authorities. The Government maintains that it is false to affirm that it has introduced the death penalty for the crime of going on strike. As regards the allegation concerning the increase in the working week by four hours (Decree No. ), the Government points out that this Decree stipulates that a full working week of  hours cannot be exceeded except in the cases provided for by legislation already existing, which are similar to those provided for in the Hours of Work (Industry) Convention,  (No. ), of the ILO. In any case the Decree was in effect only until  December . As regards order , which has been alleged to abolish the right to be absent from work for union affairs, the Government explains, quoting certain provisions of the Order, that employers are obliged to grant workers the leave necessary to carry out trade union functions outside the workplace, in accordance with the number of hours established in this text. It is up to the trade union organisation to make up the wages, etc., of the leaders who make use of this leave, unless by means of a collective agreement or contract it is provided that payment for this time is at the employer's cost. These provisions are temporary.
.As regards the allegation that Legislative Decree No.  has done away with protection for those who in the past have led or in the future will lead, illegal strikes or prevent workers from carrying out their duties, the Government quotes the provisions in question and asks whether it can be maintained that a worker who ""commits illegal acts which have prevented or prevent other workers from carrying out their jobs, or leads illegal interruptions in work"" is a worker who deserves to take continued advantage of his contract of employment.
.With respect",0,1973,Chile
111,"The Act recognising its legal existence (Act No. ) provides in section  that social aims can under no circumstances be ""connected with party politics or be electoral"". Yet, the Government continues, this trade union organisation was of such a political nature and its activities controlled by the Government to such an extent, that of the four Labour Ministers who sat in Senior Allende's Cabinet, three were officers of the Single Central Organisation of Workers. Two of them exchanged the functions of minister of Labour and Social Affairs and of President of the Single Central Organisation of Workers.
.As regards the allegations relating to the imprisonment of trade union leaders, the Government states that no trade union leaders have been imprisoned or actively sought as has been stated to the ILO and that basic human rights have not been violated. The Government states that a few extremists were also union leaders and had engaged in acts of violence such as sabotage, illegal possession of weapons, armed resistance to police officers and illegal trafficking on the black market in goods often coming from the premises where they worked and that they must answer for such acts in a court of law like any criminal at any period in the history of Chile. All these persons are being tried by the courts in accordance with due legal process and the provisions that have been in force in Chile for many years. Some others have sought asylum in the embassies of foreign countries thus proving, according to the Government, their participation in criminal acts. The Government adds that the political circumstances of Chile are those of civil war, which forces it to adopt certain legal restrictions of a temporary and exceptional nature that will be repealed once peaceful civil conditions are re-established through the disarming of guerrilla forces and a one-man executive is elected freely and democratically. All collective bargaining has been suspended until December .
.In an appendix the Government refers to the persons mentioned by name in the complaints and states that three of them, Luis Figueroa Mazuela, Fidelma Allende and Benedicto Cerqueira de Silva, are refugees in embassies and that one of them, Rolando Caldern, is detained on Dawson Island and that proceedings have been commenced against him. Further, the Government notes that none of the other persons mentioned in the complaint of the WFTU are being detained.
.The Government concludes by stating that the allegations submitted have not been proved by the complainants. It adds that there has been no anti-union persecution and that those imprisoned are being brought to justice in accordance with procedures established before the commission of the alleged offences. Finally, according to the Government, human rights have been respected at all times.
.The Committee experienced particular difficulty in dealing with this case because the Government's reply had reached it after the commencement of its session. In these circumstances it was not able to examine the substance of the issues placed before it nor could it reach any final conclusions. The Committee was perfectly aware of the serious situation which surrounded the case under its consideration. It pointed out in this respect that in cases where it considered complaints concerning alleged infringements of trade union rights committed under a state of emergency or a state of siege or under the terms of an internal security Act, it had always expressed the opinion that it was not competent to come to a decision on the need or the advisability of such legislation, which was a question purely political in character, but that it should consider the repercussions which such legislation might have on the free exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee proposed to examine the case thoroughly at its next session, taking into account any new supplementary information which might be transmitted by either the complainants or the Government.
.As a preliminary measure, however, the Committee recommended the Governing Body at paragraph  of its th Report:""(a) to express its concern at the gravity of the allegations posed in the various complaints with respect to which it has just received a reply from the Government;""(b) without at present coming to a conclusion as to the substance of the complainants' allegations, to call the attention of the Government(i) to the importance which it attaches to the generally accepted principle that employers' and workers' organisations should not be subject to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority;(ii) to the importance which it attaches to the principle of a fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary and if possible by the regular courts, in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the Government considers have no relation to their trade union functions;""(c) to request the Government to transmit any supplementary information which it may obtain on the latest developments concerning the situation of the several persons mentioned in the complaints about whom it has already supplied certain information; and""(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a new report to the Governing Body at its next session, taking into account any supplementary information which may be transmitted by either the complainants or the Government.""
.The Governing Body approved these recommendations in considering the Committee's th Report at its st Session (November ), and instructed the Director-General to ask the Government of Chile whether, should the Governing Body decide to refer the complaint to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association, the Government would be willing to agree to its being so referred. This was brought to the Government's notice in a communication dated  November . The Government was requested to be good enough to take the necessary steps to ensure that the information requested in paragraph  of the th Report, together with its reply respecting the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission be sent as quickly as possible.
.Other complaints have been received since the Committee's session in November  and have been transmitted to the Government upon receipt.
.The International Metalworkers' Federation, in support of its complaint, sent in two further communications, one dated  November and the other  December . Five communications were received from the World Federation of Trade Unions - one dated  November, another two  November, and two more on  January and  February . The Miners' Trade Unions International, the Latin American Federation of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries and thee World Confederation of Labour sent in communications dated  November,  December and  December , respectively.
.In its two additional communications, the International Metalworkers' Federation urges that an immediate stop be put to breaches of Convention no.  committed by the Government of Chile. The complainants quote three enactments: Order , which abolishes the right to be absent on union business and the right to receive wages in respect of time required in order to appear on summons before the authorities, and suspends all submission of claims; Decree  repealing protection from dismissal for all those who were or might become leaders of strikes or work stoppages or who prevented or might prevent workers from working; Decree  suspending all agreements relating to wages, benefits and other remuneration and all automatic readjustment of pensions. The IMF encloses the text of these enactments in its letter of  December .
.The World Federation of Trade Unions, in its communication dated  November , declares that Lina Benitez, alias Lina Kleovan, leader of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers, has been condemned to death.
.The WFTU, in its communication dated  November, vigorously protests against the execution of David Miranda, General Secretary of the Chilean Miners' Federation (shot on  October), and denounces the dismissals and arrests of strikers. The Miners' Trade Unions International, in its letter dated  November, declares that Miranda was shot with twenty-five companions, having been arrested immediately after the coup d'tat and sentenced to five years' imprisonment. This organisation expresses the gravest misgivings about the fate of many leading figures in the Chilean Miners' Federation and Chilean Copper Miners' Confederation.
.The Latin-American Federation of Workers in the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, in its communication of  December , says that its Chilean member-organisation, the Federation of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries, is unable to hold meetings and that most of its leaders are in custody.
.The World Confederation of Labour, in its letter dated  December, expresses keen apprehension at the continued widespread repression in Chile, entailing very serious breaches of trade union and human rights. There is no justification for maintaining a ""state of civil war"" in the opinion of the WCL. Political and trade union prisoners are not assured of the minimum guarantees of a fair trial or of being able to exercise properly their right to be defended in the normal way.
.The WCL goes on to say that public servants at all levels have had imposed on them a total ban on joining and",0,1973,Chile

.The Committee examined the present case at its session in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body found at paragraphs  to  of its th Report, which was adopted by the Governing Body at its st Session in November . (See also paragraph  below.)
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It will be recalled that the allegations made by several trade union organisations concerned in particular the arrest of many trade union leaders and the dissolution, by the Government, of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUTCH).
.The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions is contained in a communication addressed to the ILO on  September . The WFTU formulated new allegations in two subsequent communications dated  September and  October . The complaint of the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries is contained in a communication dated  September . The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions sent its complaint to the ILO in a communication dated  September . The complaint of the Latin American Central of Workers is contained in three communications dated ,  and  September . This complaint was supported by the World Confederation of Labour. The International Metalworkers' Federation addressed its complaint to the ILO on  September , and the complaint of the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers is contained in a communication dated  September . The Trade Unions International of Workers in Commerce forwarded its complaint in two communications dated  September and  October . The Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees forwarded its complaint in two communications dated  September and  October . The Miners' Trade Unions International sent its complaint in two communications dated  September and  October . The complaints of the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers and the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers are contained in communications dated ,  and  October  respectively.
.In its communication of  September , the World Federation of Trade Unions refers to the arrest of numerous trade union leaders, and expresses fear for the lives of Luis Figueroa, Rolando Caldern, Ernesto Vogel, Eduardo Rojas, Octavio Gonzlez, Luis Guzmn, Fidelma Allende, Manuel Dinamarca, Mario Navarro, Aldo Romachiotti, Tucapel Jimnez, Jorge Godoy, Juan Ponce, Gilberto Garcia, in particular, all leaders of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers, and of Jorge Espinoza, Roberto Prieto and Benedicto Cerqueira, of the Secretariat of the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity.
.In its communication dated  September  the Latin American Central of workers (CLAT) asks that, faced with the situation in which Chilean workers at present find themselves and in order to save the lives of numerous workers, militants and trade union leaders, the ILO should send a mission to Chile. The CLAT states that the Government is infringing all the rights of the workers and their organisations and is organising a violent campaign of repression against them as well as against the Latin American trade unionists who have found refuge in Chile. It requests the ILO to intervene with the Chilean Government in order to re-establish trade union freedoms and rights. In a subsequent communication, dated  February , the CLAT repeats its request that a mission be sent.
.In their respective communications, the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building Wood and Building Materials Industries, the International Metalworkers' Federation, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied industries workers, the Trade Unions International of Workers in Commerce, the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees, the Miners' Trade Unions International, the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers, and the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers allege that numerous trade union leaders have been imprisoned or are being actively sought by the military authorities and that trade union rights are being violated or that they have no news of several trade union leaders. These complainants request the ILO to intervene in order to free the trade union leaders and ensure the respect of trade union rights.
.In its second communication, dated  September , the World Federation of Trade Unions states that it has been informed of the arrest of Roberto Prieto, a Uruguayan trade unionist, Secretary of the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin America and Vice-President of the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco and Allied Industries Workers and expresses its grave anxiety for the fate of Benedicto Cerqueira and Jorge Espinoza, leaders of the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity, of whom it has no news. The WFTU states in its letter of  October  that the President of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers, Luis Figueroa, is sought by the authorities, and adds that a reward of , escudos is offered to any person giving information of his whereabouts.
.In their respective communications, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, the International Metalworkers' Federation, the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees and the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers condemn the dissolution of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers by the Chilean Government. The Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees and the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers state that their member organisations in Chile have been dissolved. The Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers indicates that the organisation affiliated with it in Chile has had its activities banned arbitrarily.
.An answer from the Government was received in November , at a time when the Committee was already sitting.
.The Government's reply under which the change of political rgime came about in Chile and the reasons for such a change. The Government states in particular that under the previous Government, state control of the economy was characterised by systematic persecution of workers and trade union leaders who did not share the Government's ideology. In the State-run undertakings, Marxist trade union leaders had become ""informers"" for the new management, serving interests contrary to those they pretended to represent. Legitimate strikes, such as that of the El Teniente miners, were repressed with unprecedented violence.
.As regards the allegations relating to the dissolution of the CUTCH, the Government notes that measures were taken to cancel the legal personality of the Single Central Organisation of Workers, because it had been proved to be a political instrument and not a union, and to serve interests contrary to those of the workers. Its unrepresentative character, its declaration of principles, in which it proposed the establishment of Marxist-Leninism in Chile, the gerrymandered election of its national executive to the detriment of the democratic majority, its constant perfidy to the workers' cause during the last three years, and its entire dependence on the state-employer, prejudicial to the interests of its members left no choice, the Government claims, but to cancel its legal existence. One fact in itself is alleged to demonstrate the total political dependence of the Single Central Organisation of Workers.",0,1973,Chile
113,"the situation, which raises important problems with regard to a number of basic principles of freedom of association. A body appropriate for carrying out this examination is the Fact-Finding and conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association. In this regard the Committee would like to refer, as it has already done in its Fourth Report, to the resolution concerning freedom of association adopted by the Fifth Conference of American States Members of the ILO (Petropolis, April ). This draws the attention of governments which may be concerned in any cases which the Governing Body may recommend for referral to the Fact-Finding Commission for examination to the desirability of having full regard, when considering whether or not they are prepared to give their consent to such referral, to the advantages of impartial and objective examination of such allegations by the Commission as a means of alleviating tensions arising out of such allegations.
.Consequently the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide to request the Government of Chile to give its consent to the case's being referred to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association;(b) should the Government consent, to request the Director-General to submit more detailed proposals to the Governing Body at its next session, for the reference of the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission.Geneva,  February  (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.

The complaints of the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers and the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers are contained in communications dated ,  and  October  respectively.
.In view of the allegations formulated and the fears concerning the lives of several trade unionists expressed by the world Federation of Trade Unions in its first communication, the contents of the complaint were transmitted to the Government by telegram and then by letter indicating that this was a case considered urgent according to the procedure in force. All the other complaints were also submitted to the Government as they came in so that the Government might send its observations as soon as possible.
.During the session of the Committee on  November  a reply was received from the Government.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Protection of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has experienced particular difficulty in dealing with this case because the Government's reply reached it after the commencement of its session. In these circumstances it is not able to examine the substance of the issues placed before it nor can it reach any final conclusions. The Committee is perfectly aware of the serious situation which surrounds the case under its consideration. It wishes to point out in this respect that in cases where it has considered complaints concerning alleged infringements of trade union rights committed under a state of emergency or a state of siege or under the terms of an internal security Act, it has always expressed the opinion that it was not competent to come to a decision on the need or the advisability of such legislation, which is a question purely political in character, but it has been of the opinion that it should consider the repercussions which such legislation might have on the free exercise of trade union rights.

114,"to the allegation that Legislative Decree No.  has suspended the application of all collective agreements relating to wages, benefits and other remuneration, and all automatic readjustment of pensions, the Government states that this order was only an interim measure, caused by the serious inflationary processes and chaotic situation in industry and the failure of the national economy. The Order suspended provisions concerning automatic readjustments. Subsequently various means were enacted pursuant to which bonuses and advances on readjustments of salaries and pensions were granted, and the establishment of tripartite Committees to study and suggest general frameworks of salaries and working conditions was laid down.
.The Government goes on to refer to Order No. , issued only a few days after the fall of the previous Government, and points out that in this document reference was made only to the dismissal of saboteurs, delinquents, extremists and agitators, pursuant to the provisions of the law. The same document also ordered, owing to the emergency situation which prevailed in the country, the suspension of some agencies such as the Conciliation Board and the Labour Arbitration Courts. These measures have been gradually becoming inoperative. Trade union activities have been suspended only in so far as they concern collective agreements, arbitration awards and similar matters while everything else carries on. At present , trade union organisations are in existence, with nearly , leaders. The only organisation which has wound up its activities is the Single Central Workers' Organisation (CUTCH).
.The Government also makes reference to the allegation concerning the prohibition of the right of assembly. In this regard it quotes provisions of the Internal State Security Act and the Constitution of the State, which authorise in exceptional cases the restriction of certain civil rights, including the right of assembly. The Government also quotes Legislative Decree No.  of  December , which is of an interim nature and permits only trade union meetings of an informative character or concerning the internal management of the organisations. The Government adds that these measures are becoming less rigidly applied and that in recent, weeks a number of meetings have taken place at which trade union problems have been discussed.
.The Government puts forward a series of comments concerning the conclusions and recommendations contained in the Committee's th Report. In the first place, as regards the dissolution of the CUTCH, the Government repeats the reasoning advanced in its first reply and then analyses the Act by which this and other trade union organisations had been granted legal personality. After stating its legal arguments, the Government points out that the object of this Act (No. ) was to grant legal personality only to this particular central trade union organisation, implicitly prohibiting the possible existence of any other central organisation. In this way, the Government states, Convention No.  and the Constitutional Reform Act of  were violated. The Government goes on to say that, once it is shown how the CUTCH obtained its legal personality through legislation to enter the service of a particular government, further legislation can legitimately dissolve its legal personality if the succeeding government has no need of this sort of political tool. The unions belonging to the CUTCH can form another Confederation. Several Confederations have already been formed since  September . Nevertheless it will not be possible to form again a trade union organisation whose legal personality is granted by law.
.As regards the principle expressed by the Governing Body according to which there should be a fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary and if possible by the regular courts in all cases, including cases in which trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences, the Government states that the legal traditions of the country will not be violated by the present Government. Chileans and non-Chileans alike have always been tried according to the legislation in force at the time of the commission of the offence and by courts already in existence at that time. The Code of Military Justice, which is being applied in certain cases, has been in force since  and in its present form since . The Code of Criminal Procedure, which is applied in other cases, has been in force for over  years and the Courts of Justice have been active for  years. The Government gives the example of three persons who were closely involved with the previous Government and who are being tried in the ordinary courts of law for their offences.
.Finally the Government states that it has disproved all the allegations and it requests that the complainants put forward be dismissed.
.In its communication of  February  the Government refers to the question put to it by the Governing Body, ""whether, should the Governing Body decide to refer the complaint to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association, the Government would be willing to agree to its being so referred"".
.In reply to this question, the Government is of the opinion that in the hypothetical case where the Committee on Freedom of Association advised, and the Governing Body reached, the conclusion that it would be appropriate to refer the matter to the abovementioned Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, the Government would be able to reach an appropriate and precise decision on a concrete basis regarding its willingness to accept the referring of the matter only after examining, in the light of the corresponding report of the Committee and of any decision which the Governing Body may teach, the grounds in support of such a move and after analysing the application of the rules of procedure proper to the case.
.Just before the meeting of the Committee the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions presented a new communication dated  February . This communication describes the Chilean institutional order and the methods adopted by the authorities since  September , particularly as regards the unions, their functioning their dissolution, the situation of trade union leaders and other matters relating to civil rights. Two other communications were forwarded by the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers on  February , and received on  February. These contain allegations which refer in particular to the deaths and imprisonment of officers of the Single National Union of Workers in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Laboratories and Related Branches (SUTRAL) and the Single Union of Workers in Plastics (SUTRAP). These three communications have not as yet been either transmitted to the Government or examined by the Committee. Further, on  February  the World Confederation of Labour also sent in a communication requesting that a commission of inquiry be sent to Chile.
.The Committee notes with interest the detailed information forwarded by the Government concerning various allegations made in the complaints, and in particular the situations of a number of union leaders and trade union organisations and the various legal texts enacted by the Government. It appears from this information that several of these leaders are at liberty, while others have sought asylum in embassies or have left the country, although it does not show why they have sought asylum, whether charges have been laid against them or whether there is any reason why they should not obtain a safe conduct. As regards the various trade union organisations mentioned by the Government, the information received does not show when and under what circumstances a number of them elected their executive Committees. In this connection it should be noted that Circular No.  of the Ministry of the Interior provides that trade union meetings can be held only with prior authorisation and in the presence of a member of the state police, that the mayor or governor is empowered to decide whether trade union Committees should resign, in whole or in part, that he may accept or refuse persons proposed to them by the organisations concerned, and that the Ministry of Labour will propose the means by which executive Committees which are active in outlawed political parties are to be replaced. Further, the Government has still not sent its observations concerning the shooting and death of various members and leaders of trade unions: David Miranda, Ivn Gordillo, Almonacid, Hctor Rojo, Samuel Nez, Armando Jimnez, Guillermo Alvarez, Isidoro Carrillo, Bernab Cabrera, Vladimir Araneda, Luis Valdivia, Luis Mamani, Ricardo Garcia and five union leaders of the Cobre-Sal mine, Hctor Martinez Molina, Manuel Donoso, Luis Norabuena and Danile Vergara. Other names figure in a communication just received.
.The Committee notes from the information available that the facts relating to the events mentioned in the complaints are very complex. Moreover, the allegations made raise serious issues, such as the imprisonment, asylum, and even execution, of trade unionists, restrictions on the right to organise, the dissolution of trade union organisations and restrictions on their activities, issues concerning which conflicting versions exist. A large part of the Chilean trade union movement seems to be affected, and recently fresh complaints have been lodged.
.In these circumstances, it would be highly desirable to be able to proceed with an impartial and deeper examination of",0,1973,Chile
115,".In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ), the Government of Chile has submitted a further report on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association;(b) to urge the Government to promulgate as soon as possible new trade union legislation, thereby giving effect to its stated intention to do so, and to repeal Legislative Decree No.  in order to ensure the normal functioning of trade union activities;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above with respect to trade union elections;(d) to note with interest the changes contemplated in the system of tripartite Committees, and to express the hope that they will constitute a step towards the full re-establishment of free collective bargaining;(e) to remind the Government that the Committee still requires information concerning the Ranquil Confederation and the United Confederation of Workers and Peasants in order to be able to assess the present situation of these organisations, as well as information concerning the measures taken to grant legal personality to the FIEMC and the FENATEX.(f) to request the Government to supply information on the situation of the ANESE;(g) with regard to the questions relating to human rights, to note that the allegations referring to the arrest or disappearance of certain persons are being examined within the context of Case No. ;(h) to request the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and to submit a report on this subject by  October .
.Under these conditions the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Government of Chile submitted a further report on  September  relating to the evolution of the situation as regards the recommendations by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association and the resolution concerning human and trade union rights in Chile, adopted by the Conference at its th Session ();(b) to note the adoption of new Constitutional provisions concerning trade union rights, but to renew its appeal to the Government to promulgate as soon as possible new trade union legislation conforming fully with the recommendations made by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations with regard to collective bargaining set out in paragraph  above and to point out once again that an important objective of the Government should be to restore the practice of collective bargaining as soon as possible;(d) to note with interest the winding up of the labour coordination Committees and to express the hope that the new administrative institutions and structures will make it possible to promote relations between the public authorities and employers' and workers' organisations, and between the latter;(e) to deplore the lack of information from the Government on the conditions under which the Ranquil Confederation and the United Confederation of Workers and Peasants are undertaking their trade union activities and to request the Government once again to supply information on the situation with regard to these two organisations;(f) to point out to the Government that it would be useful if it could take all possible measures to solve the difficulties encountered by the FIEMC and FENATEX in obtaining legal personality;(g) to note with interest the adoption by the Government of Constitutional provisions protecting certain basic human rights;(h) to recall the great importance which it attaches to the effective application of the Decrees of  January and  February  concerning the protection of detainees;(i) to request the Government to continue submitting information on the evolution of the situation with regard to the recommendations made by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and to submit a report on this subject by  April .
.In its consideration of Case No. , the Committee examined a series of allegations on infringements of trade union rights and submitted two reports on the matter to the Governing Body which are contained in paragraphs  to  of its th Report and  to  of its nd Report. At its rd Session (May-June ), the Governing Body decided to refer the matter to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Committee on Freedom of Association, whose final report was accepted by the Government. This report was considered by the Governing Body at its th Session in May .At its th Session in June , the International Labour conference adopted a resolution concerning human and trade union rights in Chile. In accordance with this resolution and at the request of the Governing Body, the Government, pursuant to article  of the Constitution of the ILO, submitted a report on  October  on the steps taken to implement the recommendations of the Committee.
.At its th session in November , the aforementioned Government's report was placed before the Governing Body which instructed the Director-General to ask the Government, again in accordance with article  of the Constitution, to report by  April  on developments in the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association and the Conference resolution. According to this decision, this report should deal in particular with the matters on which the Government has not yet supplied information, including satisfactory answers on certain points (re-election of trade union representatives; the right to collective bargaining; certain specific trade union matters with regard to the restoration of trade union assets, the grant of legal personality to certain organisations, the takeover of two organisations, the normalisation of the financial situation and resumption of activities of specific organisations of rural workers and the avoidance of discrimination between trade union organisations; the dismissal of trade union officials; and points relating to the arrest and trial of trade unionists). In the same decision, the Governing Body requested the Committee on Freedom of Association to examine the report of the Government and submit a report to the Governing Body at its th Session. The Government sent its report on  April .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ). The Government's report now before the Committee was also requested by the Governing Body pursuant to article  of the Constitution in connection with these instruments.
.With regard to the matters examined as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the resolution concerning human and trade union rights in Chile adopted by the Conference at th Session () and the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ), the Government of Chile has sent a report, based on article  of the Constitution, on the development of the situation in respect of the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association relating to the case of Chile and the Conference resolution;(b) to urge the Government to adopt without delay trade union legislation conforming to the principles of freedom of association and to end the restrictions on trade union activities which are currently in force;(c) to note that the Government has increased the number of advisory Committees on remuneration, and to point out that an important objective of the Government should be to restore the practice of collective bargaining as soon as possible;(d) to draw attention to the importance it attaches to the observance of the recommendation of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, to the effect that the labour coordination Committees should be converted into tripartite advisory bodies, as described in paragraph  above;(e) as regards the situation of certain trade union organisations:(i) to note with interest that the Government has issued legislative provisions concerning the payment to agricultural workers' organisations of the funds to which they are entitled, but, at the same time to point out that the position of the Ranquil Confederation and the United Confederation of Workers and Peasants has not been clarified and the Government has not provided any information on the points referred to in paragraph  above;(ii) to note that the Government has not complied with the Commission's recommendation with regard to the ending of the takeover by the Government of the Single Union of Workers in Education (SUTE); that no information has been provided on the position of the National Association of Education Service Employees (ANESE); that the law authorising the staff of the ministry of Education to exercise trade union activities has been repealed and that the legal personality of the SUTE has been revoked, in contravention of the principles of freedom of association and of the Commission's recommendation that the new trade union legislation should recognise the right of workers, including public servants, to establish organisations",0,1973,Chile

117,".The complaint of the Uruguayan Workers' Federation is contained in a communication dated  October  addressed to the Director-General of the ILO and the Federation provided further information in a letter dated  November . These communications were transmitted to the Government which sent its observations on  January .
.Uruguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint the Uruguayan Workers' Federation alleges that Decree No. / to promulgate the Act regulating the organisation and activities of trade unions, and in particular sections , , , , , , , -, ,  and  of the Act, violate the terms of Convention No. .
.In all these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraphs , , ,  and  above with a view to introducing the necessary amendments in the legislation and to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this case in connection with its examination of reports supplied by the Government under article  of the Constitution of the ILO.",0,1973,Uruguay
118,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",-1,1974,Dominican Republic
119,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1974,Dominican Republic
120,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",-1,1974,Dominican Republic
121,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1974,Dominican Republic
122,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",-1,1974,Dominican Republic
123,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1974,Dominican Republic
124,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1974,Dominican Republic
125,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",-1,1974,Dominican Republic
126,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1974,Dominican Republic
127,".The Committee already examined this case in May  and submitted at that session an interim report which is reproduced in paragraphs - of its st Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (May ).
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As the Committee has pointed out in a previous case concerning Argentina, what it is concerned with is not whether the action taken is legal under Argentine law, but whether the legal powers vested in the Argentine Government have been exercised in a manner inconsistent with freedom of association. The Committee emphasised the importance of due process in cases in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political nature or offences under the ordinary law. The requirement of due process would not appear to be fulfilled if under the national law the effect of a state of emergency is that a court cannot make and does not make an examination of the merits of the case. The Committee also considered that the granting to a trade unionist of his freedom on condition that he leaves the country is not compatible with the free exercise of trade union rights. In view of this, the Committee feels that it would be desirable for the Government to reconsider Mr. Ongaro's case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the allegations respecting the withdrawal of trade union status from the FGB, to note the information submitted by the Government;(b) regarding the detention of Mr. Ongaro, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations and principles set out in paragraph  above, in particular, concerning the possibility of reviewing his case, and to emphasise that no trade unionist should be kept in prison or deprived of his freedom of movement without having been brought before the courts with the least possible delay.
.The complaint was submitted by a communication of  December  and the complainants, provided additional information by a letter of  December . The Government sent its observations in a communication of  April .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee has already had occasion to consider questions of arrest during states of emergency, specifically in a case concerning Argentina and a previous arrest of Mr. Ongaro. Although it has always refrained from expressing an opinion on the political aspects of a state of emergency, it has emphasised that such measures should be accompanied by adequate judicial safeguards applied within a reasonable period and that a person under arrest should be afforded the guarantee of regular judicial proceedings with the least possible delay.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the withdrawal of trade union status from the Buenos Aires Printers' Federation:(i) to call attention to the principles and considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above;(ii) in view of the consequences of this measure, to suggest to the Government that it consider the possibility of reviewing its decision;(b) regarding the detention of Mr. Ongaro, to recall the principles set out in paragraph  above and to request the Government to supply, in the light of these principles, detailed information regarding Mr. Ongaro's situation;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has obtained the information requested.Geneva,  May .

128,".The complaint of the Buenos Aires Journalists' Association is contained in a communication dated  January . A copy of this complaint was forwarded to the Government, which sent a reply on  May .
.Argentina has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  January  the complainant alleges that the Ministry of Labour has threatened to revoke its ""trade union status"" and its right to represent workers.
.In its letter of  May  the Government states that it is of the opinion that the complaint does not provide a sufficient basis upon which to found a case. It states further that the conditions prevailing in the country have caused it to introduce anti-inflationary measures to prevent the constant diminution of the real value of incomes. For this purpose a National Accord dealing with salaries was drawn up by Government, employers and workers and is contained in Act No. , which also affirmed the provisions of Act No.  concerning the negotiation of collective agreements. Recently, according to the Government, wages and salaries have been adjusted according to these legal provisions. The Government adds that the principles of Convention No.  are applied in the country on the basis of a true coincidence of aims of Government and organised labour.
.The Committee considers that if ministerial revocation of the trade union status of the complainant organisation should effectively prevent it from exercising normal trade union functions, this would appear to call in question the principle established in Convention No.  according to which workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority.
.Since, however, the complainant has not submitted any further information in substantiation of its complaint, although given the opportunity to do so, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination on its part.",0,1974,Argentina
129,".The complaint from the International Union of Food and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) was submitted by a communication of  May . The complainant submitted further information by a letter of  June . The Government presented its observations in a communication of  May .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The IUF alleges in its initial communication that its General Secretary, Mr. Dan Gallin and his Regional Secretary for Latin America Mr. Enildo Iglesias, when visiting several Latin American countries to prepare for the IUF Sixth Regional Conference for Latin America, which took place in April , were invited in particular to Peru, to attend the Congress of the National Federation of Hotel and Allied Workers (Lima, - March) and the inauguration of the new premises of the Perulac (Nestl) Workers' Union (Chiclayo,  March). These two organisations are affiliated to the IUF.
.On  March, continues the complainant, Mr. Gallin and Mr. Iglesias were arrested by the Peruvian security police at Chiclayo and taken to police headquarters in Lima, where they were held without charges and incommunicado throughout the day of  March. Upon release, they were taken to a hotel and kept there under police guard until the following morning. Being confined to the hotel, they were unable to attend the Congress of the National Federation of Hotel and Allied Workers which began on the evening of  March.
.In its second communication, the complainant refers to similar earlier events it states that Mr. Iglesias visited Peru in May . The police arrested him at Cajamarca on  May at the end of a trade union meeting. After a short interrogation, he was transferred to Chiclayo and interrogated again. The next day he was taken to Lima (still under arrest and incommunicado) and interrogated by various police departments. He was expelled on  May. The only explanation offered, despite repeated requests made by him, was that his arrival in the country had coincided with the strike by one of the organisations affiliated to the IUF.
.The complainant adds that Mr. Iglesias returned to Peru on  July  and was summoned the next day before the Prefect of the City of Lima (the highest police authority in the city) who interrogated him about the reasons for his presence in Peru, the length of his stay, etc. The Prefect was satisfied with his explanations and said that he was free to do what he liked and would have no difficulties in the future unless his visit coincided with a labour conflict in which a union affiliated to the IUF was involved; apart from that he could freely visit affiliated organisations and participate in their congresses, etc., as in the past.
.The Government states in its reply that Mr. Gallin and Mr. Iglesias entered Peru with tourist visas and, despite that, indulged in activities prejudicial to public order, such as participating on  May  in the activities of the National Federation of Hotel and Allied Workers. Consequently, continues the Government, in view of Mr. Iglesias' previous activities and the activities in which the two leaders were involved with Mr. Arturo Castillo Chirinos, General Secretary of the Perulac Workers' Union and a well-known agitator, the police had conducted Mr. Iglesias and Mr. Gallin to Lima to obtain explanations regarding the reasons for their stay in Peru. According to the Government, the inquiry showed that Mr. Iglesias had taken part in trade union matters of a domestic nature completely unassociated with the touristic nature of his trip. For that reason, the authorities had been obliged, in order to safeguard peace and public order, to expel the two leaders.
.The Government then describes certain earlier events which, it maintains, show that Mr. Iglesias is an agitator and a disturber of internal public order. He had entered Peru on  May  and had unsuccessful talks the next morning with the management of Perulac concerning the position of workers in that undertaking who had started a strike. On  May, he had gone to Chiclayo to take part in a meeting with Perulac workers and had offered them a sum equivalent to $, for the continuation of the strike. He had then gone to Cajamarca on  May to attend a general meeting of the union and had again offered financial aid for the continuation of the strike. Mr. Iglesias' activities, continues the Government, were not therefore those of a tourist and as they further aggravated the existing labour conflicts, the authorities had expelled him. He had returned to Peru on  July  for talks with the leaders of three national unions, including the two referred to.
.Statements made by Mr. Gallin on  March , adds the Government, show that his activities were designed to promote labour disputes in the country. In , for example, the IUF had handed over , soles to the Perulac Union for the workers on strike and had also sent , soles to the Peruvian Food and Allied Workers' Federation in  in support of a strike. The Government concludes that the action taken against Mr. Gallin and Mr. Iglesias was based on the undeniable right of every State to exercise its domestic sovereignty in defence of internal public order and to ensure smooth industrial relations. It considers that the complainant interfered in the country's internal affairs.
.This case concerns two leaders of an international trade union organisation who were expelled, according to the Government, for having jeopardised public order by participating in the activities of national unions affiliated to the IUF whilst on a visit with tourist visas; one of them had previously supported labour disputes, in particular by providing money to support strikes organised by national workers' organisations.
.The Committee has already pointed out in the past that international trade union solidarity is one of the basic objectives of any trade union movement and that one of the corollaries of the right to affiliate with international trade union organisations is the right of the national organisations to enjoy all the advantages resulting from their affiliation. Nevertheless, the granting of such advantages must not conflict with the law, it being understood that the law should not be such as to render any such affiliation meaningless. Any government has the right to take the necessary measures to maintain public order and, for this purpose, to check the reason for a visit to the country by trade unionists who may be under suspicion in this connection.
.With specific reference to the visit to Peru made by Mr. Gallin and Mr. Iglesias in March , the Committee notes that its purpose, according to the complainant, was to attend the Congress of the National Federation of Hotel and Allied workers and the inauguration of the new premises of the Perulac Workers' Union. Still according to the complainant, the Prefect of Lima assured Mr. Iglesias In July  that he would have no difficulty in future in visiting unions affiliated to the IUF and in attending their congresses, provided that his visit did not coincide with a labour dispute. The Government claims that the statements made by Mr. Gallin in March  showed that the purpose of his activities was to support labour conflicts in Peru. The Government has given no further information in this connection, merely referring to financial support given to affiliated Peruvian organisations on the occasion of the strikes in , and pointing cut that Mr. Gallin and Mr. Iglesias had indulged in activities jeopardising public order, such as their participation on  May  in activities of the Federation mentioned.
.The Committee considers that, as a general rule, the visiting of affiliated national trade union organisations and participation in their congresses are normal activities for international workers' organisations, subject to the provisions of national legislation with regard to the admission of foreigners. The Peruvian Government does not specify why it considers that participation by Mr. Gallin and Mr. Iglesias in May  in the activities of the National Federation of Hotel and Allied Workers jeopardised public order and justified their expulsion from the country. The Committee notes in this connection the statements said to have been made by the Prefect of Lima to Mr. Iglesias and which appeared to define the authorities' attitude regarding participation in this type of trade union activity.
.Under these conditions, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body call the attention of the Government and all parties concerned to the considerations and principles set out in paragraphs  to , especially as regards relations and contacts between international trade union organisations and their national affiliates and respect by the former for national legislation.",0,1974,Peru
130,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",-1,1974,Dominican Republic

These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1974,Dominican Republic
132,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",-1,1974,Dominican Republic
133,"it again made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information.
.Regarding Cases Nos. , ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: three communications, of  October ,  September  and  June , from the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), a communication of  November , from the National Federation of Dockworkers, two communications, of  May  and  November , from the Stevedores' Union (POASI), a communication of  August , from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), two communications, of  September  and  July , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), three communications, of  November ,  July and  October , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).
.These complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, with requests for observations. Apart from some very general replies sent by communications of  January and  July , and despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the first complaints (Case No. ), the Committee received no information from the Government on the various allegations. In November  and May , the Committee sent urgent requests to the Government to submit the information requested (Case No. ).
.As the information requested on all these cases was not received, the Committee asked the Director-General in November  to communicate with the highest level of the Government, on behalf of the Committee, expressing the Committee's concern and urgently requesting the Government to provide the observations requested from it (Cases Nos. , ,  and ). The Government finally submitted information by communications of ,  and  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).",-1,1974,Dominican Republic
134,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.
.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May ",-1,1974,Dominican Republic
135,"the principle that employers should recognise the organisations representative of their staffs for the purposes of collective bargaining. The Committee has also pointed out that the competent authorities should, in all cases, have the power to proceed to an objective verification of any claim by a union that it represents the majority of the workers in an undertaking, provided that such a claim appears to be plausible.
.Under the Act recently adopted, the Minister may, in the event of doubt or dispute, order a poll in order to determine the union(s) which the employer must recognise for the purposes of collective bargaining if the workers vote to that effect. The Committee considers that, provided the Minister makes effective use of his powers to order a poll, these provisions should ensure that the type of dispute under consideration in the present case will not arise, and thus help to promote collective bargaining.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note, with particular interest, the new legal provisions which take account of the suggestions it made in previous cases, and which can be expected to put an end to anti-trade union practices and avoid disputes such as those described in the present case, and to decide as a result that the case does not call for further examination.
.The Jamaica Union of Bank Employees presented a complaint in a communication dated  May , and supplied additional information in a letter dated  June . The Government furnished its observations in communications dated  June and  October .
.Jamaica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant union describes in its first communication various infringements of trade union rights alleged to have been committed in connection with the refusal of the Jamaica Citizens' Bank to recognise it. According to the complainants, since  December  this bank has been engaging in acts of antiunion discrimination in order to prevent its staff from joining the union of their choice: threats of dismissal, denial of salary increases and attempts at infiltration and ""subversion"" of the complainant union. In February  the union submitted a claim for representational rights and an audited list of its members to the Ministry of Labour. Although the union established a prima facie case based on the fact that a considerable proportion of the staff were unionised, the Bank refused to attend a meeting to agree to a poll.
.The complainants add that during this period the Ministry of Labour acted merely as an avenue for the transmission of the views of the employer rather than as an effective vehicle for the solution of the dispute. The Bank increased its opposition to the union and took action which included the dismissal of a union official, the demotion of the president of the union, continual transferral of staff without due notice, the destruction of union documents and open threats of victimisation. It also sought to refuse certain categories of workers, defined as supervisors and confidential staff, the right to representation by the union, without any legal grounds whatsoever.
.The complainant union then called a strike, which, it states, arrested the state of ""subversion"", but did not succeed in closing down the operations of the Bank. The Bank continued to refuse to negotiate, and took action to place the Bank's staff club under the control of the management. The Ministry of Labour, for its part, is said not only to have failed to set up the necessary machinery to deal with the dispute but to have collaborated with the employer and was the first to supply strike-breakers. It conducted an investigation in which only managers of the Bank were interviewed, thus providing itself with a false basis on which to refuse to act against the Bank and to justify its reluctance to utilise fully the machinery for collective bargaining. According to the complainants, the police also collaborated with the Bank: on  April , twelve members of the union were arrested for lying down in the street; four days later, the general secretary of the union was physically assaulted by four police officers while demonstrating at the Bank's head office; the same day a high-level meeting was held between the management of the Bank and senior officers of the Jamaica constabulary force; two days later, eight strike pickets were arrested and remanded in custody, following a telephone call from the management.
.The complainants add that supporters of the union were threatened - both before and during the strike, and in collusion with other banks - with closure of loan accounts and banking facilities. The Minister of Labour is said to have admitted to being almost powerless to do anything because no national laws existed to give him effective authority to settle the dispute.
.In their second communication the complainants state that the Bank has drafted lists of strikers and sent them to all the commercial banks in the island so that none of these workers will ever again be employed in a bank. The Bank is also said to have attempted to have members of the union dismissed from their jobs in other industries such as the insurance and tourist industries, and to have informed various businesses, particularly supermarkets, not to accept the cheques of strikers. The Ministry of Labour, for its part, has not set up a Commission of Inquiry, although it has been requested to do so since  April .
.The Government, in its letter of  June , refutes entirely the accusations made against it. It states that a Bill to provide for the development and maintenance of more orderly industrial relations and more effective machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes has been tabled in the House of Representatives.
.The Government supplies more detailed information in its letter of  October . It declares that it encourages autonomy in industry, and that to this end the Ministry of Labour and Employment provides machinery for the determination of representational issues involving trade unions. By agreement with the parties concerned, the Ministry may take a poll by secret ballot to determine the wishes of the workers concerned; the agreement usually provides for a determination of the bargaining position based upon the outcome of the poll. A poll may also be taken by the Ministry to determine the extent of the membership of a union in a particular establishment. But no poll can be conducted without the co-operation of the employer, who must provide a list of the workers involved and permit Ministry officials to enter its premises and conduct such a poll during working hours. According to the Government, the Bill mentioned above, which is expected to become law shortly, contains provisions for the compulsory recognition of a trade union which wins a poll. In addition the National Constitution specifically guarantees to workers the right to belong to the trade union of their choice.
.The Government appends to its communication a series of documents concerning its role in the dispute. It is stated therein that the two parties requested the intervention of the Ministry, which asked the union to supply an audited certificate of membership (which it did) and the Bank to indicate whether any other union represented or was claiming to represent the workers, and to supply a list of its employees. The union informed the Ministry that the Bank refused to allow it to represent the supervisory staff, and the Bank requested the Ministry to intervene on this issue. Meetings were held separately with both parties, following which the Bank submitted a list of its employees. A comparison of this list with the union's certificate of membership showed that the union had established a prima facie case for representational rights. Both parties were accordingly invited to suggest convenient dates for a meeting to finalise arrangements for the taking of a poll, but the Bank announced that its legal representative was not available to attend such a meeting.
.On  April  the Bank informed the Ministry that a demonstration had started because of the dismissal of a worker. The union insisted that it was a strike and that the Ministry should intervene. An investigation was made on  April, continues the Government, and branch managers and union members were interviewed; union officers were not available. The information compiled indicated that the action had affected only two branches of the Bank (including the one where the dismissed worker was employed) and that only twenty-three workers out of one hundred and sixty-four had participated in it, assisted by a few outsiders holding office in the union. The Bank declared that its operations were not affected and refused to attend any meeting with the union because of alleged damage to cars and threats to management personnel and other employees who had remained on the job. The union again asked the Minister to intervene and reported that",0,1974,Jamaica
136,".The Committee already examined this case at its session in November  and on that occasion submitted an interim report. Since then, the Government has submitted a further two communications, dated  February and  April .
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May , the Latin American Central of Workers, on behalf of its affiliate in Guatemala, the National Central of Workers (CNT), alleged that, on the occasion of the demonstration on  May , the forces of the national army and government police attacked the procession, causing the death of four people and seriously wounding many others, whose total number had not been determined. The CLAT added that the dead and wounded included members of the National Central of Workers and particularly Julio Celso de Len, a national leader and member of the Executive Committee of CLAT, who had been seriously injured. Subsequently, CLAT submitted a list of three persons said to have been killed and fifteen others said to have been injured.
.In its reply of  June  the Government referred to a report by the Ministry of the Interior, regarding the events of  May . It was indicated in this report that the workers' parade had been authorised by the prefecture, at the request of the General Secretary of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA), throughout a large area of the city. During the parade, a group of - persons led by the leaders of the Guatemalian Christian Democrat Party had endeavoured to make the parade change its course.
.The national police had told the organisers that they must not depart from the authorised route. At that point, a hail of stones had been hurled at the police forces, injuring two policemen, damaging several shops and electric lighting. In addition, a group of persons had insisted on following an unauthorised route. The police had been forced to use tear gas. The demonstrators had then scattered, but shots had been heard, fired by persons who had infiltrated the procession. The meeting subsequently took place without further incident.
.The report rejected any responsibility on the part of the national police for the shooting, as they had been expressly ordered not to use fire-arms. According to the report, responsibility for the acts of violence lay with the persons who had infiltrated the demonstration. It was also stated in the report that a group of persons taking part in the procession had told the police that they regretted the interruption caused by persons who had nothing to do with the procession which they had organised.
.During its November  Session, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, in particular:- to call attention to various principles and especially to the fact that the institution of an impartial inquiry is a particularly appropriate means of elucidating the facts and determining responsibility when events occur which lead to the loss of human lives;- to ask the Government whether an impartial inquiry was carried out regarding the events which allegedly caused the death of a number of trade unionists and injuries to others and, if so, to communicate the conclusions of the inquiry and indicate whether those responsible had been brought to trial.
.In its latest communications, the Government indicated, in particular, that a judicial inquiry is carried out on all punishable offences in order to bring to justice those responsible. The case before the ILO was no exception.
.The Committee notes this information from the Government, which seems to show that the events which gave rise to this complaint have been the subject of an inquiry. The Committee nevertheless regrets that the Government has not communicated the conclusions of the inquiry as requested. Consequently, the Committee is unable to take a decision in full knowledge of the facts.
.Nevertheless, it appears from the replies supplied by the Government that the police forces were expressly ordered not to use their fire-arms during this demonstration. The Committee also notes that the events in question took place almost four years ago.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(i) to express its regret that the Government has not communicated the conclusions of the judicial inquiry carried out concerning the serious events of  May ;(ii) to decide that no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of the case.
.In a communication dated  May , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented a complaint of alleged violations of trade union rights in Guatemala. CLAT sent further information in a communication dated  May .
.The above communications were transmitted to the Government which, in a communication of  January , indicated that there had been no violation of trade union rights and that it would send its observations later. The latter were sent in a communication dated  June .
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  May  the Latin American Central of workers, in the name of its affiliate in Guatemala, the National Central of Workers (CNT), alleged that on the occasion of the May Day demonstration, the forces of the national army (G) and the government police attacked the procession, causing the death of four people and seriously wounding many others, whose total number had not yet been determined.
.The CLAT added that the dead and wounded included members of the National Central of workers, in particular Julio Celso de Len, a national leader and member of the Executive Committee of CLAT. According to the complainant organisation, this labour leader, whose life was said to be in danger, had been seriously wounded by three bullets as he was marching peacefully past the National Congress building.
.In its communication of  May  the CLAT provided a list of persons who were said to be either dead or wounded. The former include Roberto Casimiro Estrada L, of the Zacatn Peasant League; Rafael Caal Inocente, of the Mazatenango Peasant League; and Clemente Hernandez Garcia, of the Municipal Workers' Union. Among the wounded CLAT listed Julio Celso de Len, already mentioned in its previous communication, and the names of  other persons; the CLAT did not indicate whether the latter were officers of trade unions. The CLAT attached to its communication press cuttings reporting the events of  May .
.In its reply the Government stated that the complaint presented by the CLAT was unfounded and requested that the Committee decide that the complaint called for no further examination. The Government supplied information in the form of a report of the Ministry of the Interior on the events of  May .
.The report indicated that the workers' parade had been organised by the prefecture at the request of the General Secretary of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA). In order to facilitate the demonstration, a large area of the city was marked off for the procession.
.The procession was following its planned route when a group of  to  persons, led by the leaders of the Guatemalan Christian Democrat Party, suddenly appeared and interrupted it by trying to make it change its course in the direction of the central park.
.As the new itinerary had not been authorised by the prefecture, the national police told the organisers that they must not depart from the authorised route. At this point a hail of stones was hurled at the police forces, injuring two policemen, breaking the windows of a number of shops and completely destroying the traffic lights and the electric lighting at the crossing. In spite of the damage caused and the warning given by the security forces, a group of persons still insisted on following an unauthorised route. The national police therefore had no choice but to throw tear gas bombs to oblige the demonstrators to return to the planned route. The demonstraters then scattered, whereupon shots were fired by certain persons who had infiltrated the procession. After this moment of tension the police and security forces regained control of the situation and the planned meeting took place without further incident.
.The report of the Ministry of the Interior indicated that the national police co-operated in the procession and exercised effective supervision. The tear gas was used because of the column which tried to divert the procession, and a group of persons took the opportunity to commit acts of vandalism. The report rejected the responsibility of the national police for the shooting, as they had been expressly ordered not to use firearms. The responsibility for the acts of violence lay with the persons who had infiltrated the demonstration. Finally, the report points out that a group of persons taking part in the procession told the police that they regretted this interruption, which had been caused by persons who had nothing to do with the procession which they had organised.

141,".The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) is contained in a letter dated  April , and the Government's reply in a communication dated  October .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.After recalling other cases relating to Brazil which have come before the Committee, the WFTU states that the military police of Sao Paulo (Ninth Battalion) have sent out to undertakings in that state a ""secret industrial questionnaire"", a copy of which it appends. According to the complainants this questionnaire was despatched in pursuance of general instructions given by the Brazilian military authorities and is proof that trade union rights no longer exist in Brazil, and that the authorities are seeking by such means to exercise control over undertakings, their owners and their workers and to channel to their advantage the workers' claims and any demand for respect for freedom of association. The WFTU also calls for the release of trade unionists in prison, the cancellation of proceedings brought against them and the quashing of any sentences passed.
.This questionnaire contains a list of sixty points relating to various subjects. Some are concerned with the identification of the undertaking, its owners, its management, its parent company, if any, its production, etc.; others concern the existence of a security department, a fire-fighting section, a works canteen, accommodation, a sports ground and a civil defence plan yet other questions ask the number of employees, their average age, how they are paid. There is also a question as to whether any employees belong to the military police or the armed forces.
.The questionnaire also asks whether there are any natural leaders among the employees (requesting their names, addresses and jobs in the undertaking), people who incite to strike, trade union delegates or trade union organisations represented in the undertaking (one question asks what ends they pursue and what their relations are with the management; another queries the links between employees and unions).
.The Government protests at the way in which the WFTU has attempted to link its accusations with other cases that the ILO has examined previously on the basis of information officially challenged by the Government. It denies that the questionnaire was drawn up following general instructions given by the military authorities, stating that it was undertaken on the initiative of a battalion commander who wished to conduct a survey to help him in his preventive activities in that part of the city under his supervision (the Government points out, moreover, that the situation there is normal, as it is throughout the country). The Government goes on to state that this document has nothing to do with trade union matters but forms part of a general survey of undertakings, a confidential inquiry, of a kind carried out as a matter of course in any country, undertaken by the police for preventive purposes. The questionnaire relates solely to questions of industrial safety, civil defence, and other matters essential for the preparation of police protection plans. The Government considers that this affair is not a matter for the Committee as it has no connection with the activity of trade union organisations or with the rights of individuals, let alone the rights of trade unions.
.The Government adds that the WFTU offers no evidence in support of its allegations and is unable to quote a single event which has taken place as a result of this survey. The survey will not give rise to action of any kind against any person whatsoever except in cases of emergency or serious public disturbance; no action has been taken as a result of it and no person has suffered any infringement of his rights. The Government goes on to state that the trade unions in Brazil are operating in a peaceful and constructive social climate and are fully devoted to furthering the interests of the workers; they have not even taken cognisance of the facts reported by the WFTU, since these are irrelevant to their true objectives. The accusations made by the WFTU imply that the police should be debarred from conducting inquiries, from obtaining advance knowledge of the presence of persons likely to disturb public order and from obtaining the information which will -permit them to act promptly and effectively when required to do so.
.It emerges from the information available that the Ninth Battalion of the military police of Sao Paulo has drawn up and sent out to undertakings in the area a secret questionnaire referring to various aspects of the affairs of these undertakings, including the trade unions and leaders of the workers and likely instigators of strikes.
.The Committee notes the Government's explanations and its statement to the effect that this questionnaire has no bearing upon the present position of trade unionists. According to the Government it is a practice of a kind engaged in as a matter of course in any country.
.The Committee is of the opinion that the sending of such a questionnaire to undertakings by the military authorities is not in accordance with normal practice. In many countries records are kept by labour departments concerning trade unions and their leaders, but the situation is different when it is the military authorities which ask for information, especially on the natural leaders of the workers and likely instigators of strikes.
.The Committee considers that an inquiry into such matters may involve a risk of being put to improper use by the military authorities or the police in the event of a labour dispute (for example, workers might be taken into custody simply because they are on a list of persons thus established, even though they have committed no offence). The Committee points out, moreover, that this danger is implicit in the Government's statement to the effect that the questionnaire will not give rise to action of any kind against individuals ""except in cases of emergency or serious public disturbance"". The Committee further considers that this method is likely to create such an atmosphere of mistrust that it is hardly an appropriate means of furthering the development of harmonious industrial relations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above and to request the Government to take appropriate measures to avoid risks of the kind mentioned.",0,1974,Brazil
142,"order to defend the workers' interests.
.Apart from labour-management problems, continues the Government, the trade union of the workers had difficulties because of the disagreements which arose between the elected executive Committee and the lawyer for the complainant workers who was supported by certain members. These disagreements were so serious that they led to the dismissal of the lawyer. The Government adds, however, that it was in no way involved in this decision of the union. It was only when the duly elected leaders of the union recognised that they were no longer capable of managing the union, because of the atmosphere of hostility which prevailed between the various factions, that the Minister of Labour intervened.
.It is also necessary to point out, the Government adds, that when it received the initial communications from the trade union leaders concerning the disagreements between the groups of workers, it took the view that the matter lay outside its competence and that the workers themselves should resolve the problem. A communication had also been received by the Ministry from the workers pointing cut the serious disagreements and the irregularities within the union. According to the Government, this in itself shows the wisdom of the intervention of the Ministry following the request of the leaders of the union.
.The Government points out that it has always responded to claims made by the workers, while at the same time taking care not to take steps which might, directly or indirectly, adversely affect trade union activities. The Government could not remain indifferent to a union which was in a chaotic state because of internal problems. Other problems also arose between the union lawyer and the executive when the lawyer claimed as fees one half of the amount awarded by the court to the union.
.The closure of the union, claims the Government, was justified. Some groups had decided to take extreme measures, as had been stated by the union's president in a letter to the ministry in which he requested the Minister of Labour to protect the assets of the union and restore a situation of normalcy in its premises located in the undertaking. As regards the irregularities to which the complainants drew attention, the Government acted cautiously, using legal means to redress the situation. The Government points out that for a time after the confiscation of the factory at the Cajamar quarry, it remained under the control of the Abdalla group, but in the name of a trustee. The Government completed an inventory of the assets of Cajamar before any radical steps were taken. At present the Cajamar quarry was sequestrated and the workers were completely free to defend their interests. The complaint, therefore, states the Government, has become devoid of substance as a result of subsequent developments.
.The Government explains that its decision to confiscate was facilitated by the fraud which had been perpetrated by the Abdalla group against the Treasury. The activities of the group had been closely watched by the Government since , and all steps were taken thereafter to confiscate and reimburse the Treasury as well as to indemnify the workers. The Government could be blamed for some delays caused by bureaucratic conflicts between various administrative departments, but the workers had not helped the situation by addressing their complaints at various times to different government services.
.As for the allegation that the company put obstacles in the way of the workers who wished to belong to a union, the Government states that this matter is being dealt with by the federal police. Moreover, the Government adds, it sent secretly more than  labour inspectors at the same time to investigate the Abdalla group undertakings, and their report contains information on labour conditions which justifies the action subsequently taken against the company. Action was taken through the local labour division in Sao Paulo against the group, as well as through the federal police and the department of public security.
.The Government adds that, even if the union's lawyer has ceased to work for the union, the workers' interests are properly defended and their rights respected. Strikes took place when the workers deemed this appropriate, collective agreements were signed when agreement was reached and trade union activity followed its normal course so long as it was able to maintain a properly elected executive. This executive was only set aside when it declared itself no longer capable of fulfilling its role. The Government, in the exceptional circumstances which prevailed, only intervened at the request of the properly elected executive.
.No judicial appeal, however, states the Government, has been made either by the workers or by the former union lawyer against the intervention. In fact, states the Government, the measures were taken to ensure the very survival of the union. Once the confiscation of the factory was completed, the Minister of Labour took care to appoint an executive Committee of the union consisting of members of the organisation and this Committee is now seeking to restore a normal situation with a view to holding elections.
.The Government states that the Minister acted in the only way possible in such a situation and never previously have workers and Government acted so much in common than in the matter which ended in the confiscation of the assets of the Abdalla group.
.On several occasions in the past the Committee has been called upon to deal with cases concerning intervention by the Government of Brazil in the internal affairs of trade unions. In, these cases the Committee has drawn the attention of the Government to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee has also pointed out that the placing of trade union organisations under control entails a serious danger of restricting this right.
.Moreover, the Committee has stated in a number of cases that the principles of freedom of association do not prohibit control of the internal activities of a trade union when the latter infringes the law (which should not, however, be such as to undermine the principles of freedom of association), but it has considered it to be of maximum importance that, in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure, the control should be exercised by the relevant judicial authority.
.Matters involving no dispute between the Government and the trade unions but solely consisting in a conflict within the trade union movement itself are the sole responsibility of the parties themselves. For this reason, the Committee is not called upon to examine questions concerning the relations within the union involved in the complaint and in particular the accusations brought by the complainants against the union's president and the dismissal of the union's legal adviser.
.As regards the intervention in the union by the authorities, however, the Committee notes that it commenced as long ago as September  and that it still continues. From all the information at its disposal the Committee notes that the internal affairs of the union were in a state of disorder and workers attempted to call a general meeting. This general meeting could have resulted in a settlement of the internal problems. Because of the intervention of the authorities which was called for by the president, however, the general meeting could not be held.
.In all these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations contained in paragraphs  to  above, and in particular to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof;(b) to request the Government to take appropriate measures to bring to an end the intervention which commenced as long ago as September  and to enable elections to be held for the appointment of a new executive Committee in the Union of Industrial, Cement, Lime and Plaster Workers; and(c) to request the Government, in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph  of the th Report of the Committee, to inform the Committee prior to its session in November  of the measures taken to allow elections in the above-named organisation.",0,1974,Brazil

As background information, the complainants give an account of the relations between the workers at Perus, who are the workers of the industrial, Cement, Lime and Plaster Workers' Union of Sao Paulo and the Abdalla group management and of the difficulties experienced by them in obtaining recognition of their trade, union rights. In particular, the complainants give an account of a strike in  as a result of which  workers were dismissed. Following a long court trial, which lasted until , these workers were reinstated with the right to reimbursement of all wages they had lost. According to the complainants, the total sum involved amounted, by today's standards, to some  million cruzeiros, but the greater part thereof was not claimed since more than  per cent of the workers concerned had died in the interval.
.The complainants add that, following the change of government in , their union was put under control by the authorities and the chief of personnel of the Perus was appointed union administrator, a post he occupied for one year. Between  and , continue the complainants, the Abdalla group did everything to hinder trade unionism. Workers in Perus were transferred to another undertaking in the group, named Socal, and if they refused they were dismissed. No one working in Socal was allowed to become a union member. Complaints were made to the Minister but no action was ever taken, except that the Minister stated that workers in Socal were entitled to become members of the Perus workers' union.
.In August , continue the complainants, the union brought charges against the directors of the Abdalla group undertakings, Perus and Socal, but after many months the affair was dropped by the police.
.The complainants add that between  and  the internal situation in the union deteriorated. The majority of the workers had no confidence in the union's president whose activities, including the suspension of an executive member of the union in September , were unpopular with the members. In January  the union appointed a Committee to examine its financial position and a number of irregularities were brought to light. The president was accorded a certain time in which to put matters right and refund missing sums. No report was made at that time to the Minister of Labour, but it appeared clear to the workers that the eventual intervention of the Government was made to protect the president and to favour the Abdalla group.
.The complainants add that, following further attempts to bring the Abdalla group to justice, the appropriate Ministry finally took action under the Penal Code on  May , denouncing the directors for, inter alia, failure to allow the workers to exercise their legal rights when transferring them, and preventing them from participating in the only local trade union. The court action, state the complainants, is being heard by the Federal Court in Sao Paulo. The workers realised that the only solution to the problem of recovering the  million cruzeiros awarded to them by the courts in  was the confiscation of the assets of the company.
.According to the complainants, at the end of June , a part of the company's assets was confiscated. The quarries, however, were left in the hands of the Abdalla group. The workers demanded that Socal (Abdalla group) which controlled the quarries at Cajamar be wound up.
.The complainants added that the president of the union, wishing to please both the workers and the Abdalla group at the same time, dismissed the union's legal adviser who had served the union for  years. This action was denounced by the workers who demanded a general meeting. This meeting could not, however, take place because the Minister, who according to the complainants did not want to see the president lose his office, put the union under government control.
.The workers, state the complainants, continued their efforts to obtain the reasons for the arbitrary decision of the president to dismiss the union's lawyer and for the intervention of the authorities. The information obtained by the workers indicated that the president himself had requested the intervention by the authorities. The president, add the complainants, was satisfied that a general meeting had been avoided, but he has since exercised no trade union duties nor does he have any contacts with the workers.
.The complainants add that, since the president had not been dismissed, they decided to draw the attention of the Minister of Labour to the irregularities discovered after the examination of the union's accounts.
.Although deprived of their union as a result of the government intervention, the workers continued their struggle, and in April  the union's lawyer was able to obtain access to the file containing the reasons for the intervention of the Government. According to the complainants, the lawyer was able to ascertain that it was the union's president himself who had requested the intervention on  November , on the grounds that he could no longer control the union and the workers had threatened him with violence and even with death. On the following day, the Minister of Labour confirmed the intervention by virtue of article  and () of the Labour Code.
.According to the complainants, the labour delegate of the Ministry had accepted - without any evidence - the slanderous accusations made by the president. The president had not, however, been suspended and could have returned to office, but he had last the confidence of the workers and his return would have brought up again the question of a general meeting. For these reasons, the minister prolonged the intervention indefinitely.
.The complainants state that it was only at the beginning of July  that the members of the temporarily-imposed executive Committee began to listen to the workers' claims and, at the time of lodging the complaint, the accounts were being examined by the Ministry.
.On  May , the complainants continue, a petition was addressed to the President of the Republic concerning the activities of the Abdalla group, and the workers recalled to the Minister of Labour the events which had led to the government intervention, requesting the reopening of their headquarters once a week for the purpose of meeting to discuss their problems, even in the presence of the officials of the Government. No response has been received from the Minister.
.In a further communication from the National Labour Front, dated  September , submitted by the World Confederation of Labour on  September , reference is made to the numerous interventions of the Brazilian Government in the activities of trade unions, and in particular to the intervention affecting the Union of Industrial, Cement, Lime and Plaster Workers.
.In its reply dated  January , the Government explains that for a number of years the industrial undertakings which formed part of the Abdalla group had established a system of work which was not in accordance with the labour laws, and that this had given rise on several occasions to court proceedings being taken against them at the instance of the workers.
.At the time, continues the Government, no intervention was considered necessary since questions involving labour and management are normally regulated by the labour courts which, in Brazil, are tripartite in character. Relations between labour and management, however, deteriorated and a series of strikes took place while court proceedings were going on. Two of these strikes lasted  and  days respectively. These strikes, states the Government, indicate in themselves that freedom of association is exercised. In Brazil, the right to strike is permitted under the Constitution and by Law No. /. In fact, continues the Government, the strike of  days was the beginning of a long legal battle against the Abdalla group which resulted in the group's being called upon to pay the sum of ,, cruzeiros to the  workers who had been unfairly dismissed.
.After a period of fairly reasonable relations between the workers and the employers, the Government was forced to take direct action against the group in order to protect the interests of the workers who were suffering from irregularities and even violence perpetrated by the employers. Contrary to what is stated by the complainants, the Minister of Labour himself took court action against the Abdalla group, which ended in the confiscation of all the assets of the group. The facts show, states the Government, that a hard struggle was engaged in by the authorities in",0,1974,Brazil
144,"attached to its communication a press cutting which reported that the Labour Day ceremony took place in an orderly fashion.
.The Committee notes that the complaint relates to incidents that took place on the occasion of a May Day procession, during which the forces of order are alleged to have killed a number of trade unionists and wounded others. The Committee observes that the Government places the responsibility for the events on a group of persons who are alleged to have attempted to divert the procession from its authorised route. Moreover, according to the Government, the shots were fired by persons who had infiltrated the demonstration and not by the police force, which did not use its firearms. Finally, the Committee observes that the Government's remarks do not refer to the trade unionists who, according to the allegations of the complainant, were killed or injured.
.In previous cases the Committee has considered that the right to organise public meetings and processions on the occasion of May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights. However, trade unions must conform to the general provisions applicable to all public meetings and must respect the reasonable limits which may be fixed by the authorities with a view to maintaining public order.
.In the present case, the authorisation to organise a procession had been granted on condition that it followed a predetermined itinerary. The Committee is of the view that such a reservation does not constitute a violation of trade union rights.
.As regards the events which caused the death of a number of trade unionists and injury to others, the Committee recalls that it has, on many occasions, stressed the desirability of instituting an impartial inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and to determine responsibility in the event of disturbances causing loss of life. The Government's reply does not indicate whether or not an impartial inquiry in particular, the Government does not state whether the persons who had infiltrated the demonstration and who were allegedly responsible for the shooting and the deaths and injuries, have been found and whether their responsibility has been established by the competent legal authorities.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of those concerned to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above;(b) to ask the Government whether an impartial inquiry was carried out to elucidate the facts and to determine responsibility for the events which allegedly caused the death of a number of trade unionists and injuries to others and, if so, to communicate the conclusions of the inquiry and to indicate whether those responsible for the incidents have been brought to trial;(c) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has obtained the information requested from the Government.",0,1974,Guatemala
145,"it again made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information.
.Regarding Cases Nos. , ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: three communications, of  October ,  September  and  June , from the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), a communication of  November , from the National Federation of Dockworkers, two communications, of  May  and  November , from the Stevedores' Union (POASI), a communication of  August , from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), two communications, of  September  and  July , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), three communications, of  November ,  July and  October , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).
.These complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, with requests for observations. Apart from some very general replies sent by communications of  January and  July , and despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the first complaints (Case No. ), the Committee received no information from the Government on the various allegations. In November  and May , the Committee sent urgent requests to the Government to submit the information requested (Case No. ).
.As the information requested on all these cases was not received, the Committee asked the Director-General in November  to communicate with the highest level of the Government, on behalf of the Committee, expressing the Committee's concern and urgently requesting the Government to provide the observations requested from it (Cases Nos. , ,  and ).

146,"the Government Employment Services had provided a driver for the Bank during the strike. In fact, according to the Government, this person had been supplied by a private employment agency, like all the other workers recruited by the Bank.
.The Government goes on to state that the Minister had several further meetings with both parties, but despite all his efforts the Bank still refused to attend any meeting with the union. The strike petered out due to the small number of participants and the fact that some of the strikers sought and obtained reinstatement while others obtained alternative employment. As concerns the refusal to set up a board of inquiry, the Government states that this procedure is reserved for use in major issues involving the national interest or issues in which public opinion is likely to lend weight to any recommendations made, such recommendations not being binding on the parties. This case was not considered to involve such issues. The Government likewise refutes the accusations of collaboration between the police and the employer and points out that workers are allowed to engage in peaceful picketing. However, continues the Government, on  April and  May  employees of the Bank who were union members and other union officers blocked the entrance to the Bank and blocked traffic in the street. They defied an order to move and used threatening and insulting language to the police. They were arrested, tried during the first week of September, found guilty, admonished and discharged.
.The case essentially concerns the refusal of a bank to agree that the complainant union should represent its staff, despite the intervention of the Government. According to the complainants the employer committed, before and during the resultant strike, acts of anti-union discrimination and interference in the union's activities. Lastly, strike pickets were arrested.
.As concerns these arrests, the Committee wishes to point out, as it has already done in the past, that while pickets acting in accordance with the law should not be subjected to interference by the authorities, it may be considered legitimate for a legal provision to prohibit pickets from disturbing public order and threatening workers who continue to work. The Committee notes that according to the Government workers are allowed to engage in peaceful picketing during a work stoppage, but in this specific instance they blocked the entrance to the Bank as well as traffic in the street, refused to move and used threatening and insulting language to the police. The Committee further notes that they were found guilty by the courts and discharged.
.The Committee also observes that the Government's reply gives no information about the acts of anti-union discrimination said to have been committed by the Bank, especially prior to the strike, or about the acts of interference in the union's activities. The Committee has already stressed in another case relating to Jamaica that complaints against anti-union practices should normally be examined by national machinery; although it would be desirable to settle such grievances wherever possible by discussion without treating the process as a form of litigation, in cases where differences of opinion arise resort should be had to impartial bodies or individuals representing the final step of the grievance procedure. The Committee is of the opinion that these considerations and principles are equally valid in the present case as concerns the allegations relating both to anti-union practices and to acts of interference by the employer.
.With regard to the refusal by the Bank to recognise the complainant union, the Committee recalls that it has several times examined similar complaints concerning Jamaica. It appeared from the information available in those cases - and the present case bears it out - that where a poll is conducted on the basis of an agreement between the parties, that agreement usually provides for a determination of the bargaining position based upon the outcome of the poll; a fact-finding poll, on the other hand, not being based upon an agreement, merely determines the wishes of the workers in respect of the claimant union. In any event, no poll of any kind can be conducted by the Ministry without the co-operation of the employer, who must provide a list of the names of the workers involved and permit the Ministry to enter and conduct such a poll on its premises during working hours.
.The Committee notes that in the present case, although a claim for recognition supported by an audited certificate of membership was submitted to the Ministry of Labour and Employment the union's claim appeared to be sufficiently well founded to justify the taking of a poll, the employer refused to co-operated and thus made it impossible for the poll to be conducted.
.The Committee has emphasised in previous cases including similar cases involving Jamaica the importance which it attaches to the principle that employers should recognise for collective bargaining purposes the organisations representing the workers employed by them. The Committee has also stated that the competent authorities should, in all cases, have the power to proceed to an objective verification of any claim by a union that it represents the majority of the workers in an undertaking, provided such a claim appears to be plausible, and that, if the union concerned is found to be the majority union, the authorities should take appropriate conciliatory measures with a view to obtaining the employer's recognition of that union for collective bargaining purposes.
.In this connection the Committee has noted that a Labour Relations and Industrial Disputes Bill is now before the House of Representatives and that it contains provisions for the compulsory recognition of a trade union which wins a poll. The Bill provides that the Minister may, at the request of the employer or of any trade union claiming bargaining rights in relation to a group of workers in the proposed unit, cause a ballot to be taken for the purpose of determining which unions are most representative, and that, if the ballot shows that a majority of workers wish a particular union to represent them, the employer is obliged to recognise that union as bargaining agent or be liable to stringent penalties. The Committee has remarked that, although from the language of the Bill it would appear that the Minister has discretion as to whether to order such a poll or not, the Minister has stated in Parliament that it has been decided to legislate for compulsory recognition of trade unions based on ""certification procedures"" including compulsory poll-taking.
.The Committee notes with interest the Government's statement to the effect that this Bill is expected to become law shortly. The Committee is of the opinion that under this new law it should be possible to avoid disputes of this kind and collective bargaining should be facilitated.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as concerns the allegations relating to anti-union practices and acts of interference by employers in the activities of the union, to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraph ;(b) as concerns the refusal by the Bank to recognise the complaining union:(i) to draw the Government's attention once again to the considerations and principles expressed in paragraphs  and ;(ii) to express the hope that the above-mentioned Bill will soon become law; and(iii) to request the Government to keep it informed of any developments in this connection.Geneva,  February .

147,".The complaint by the International Metalworkers Federation (IMF) is set out in two communications dated  and  April . The Government submitted its comments in a letter dated  November .
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The IFM states that the Director-General of Olivetti Colombiana S.A., Mr. Luciano Bianco, has acquired, since his arrival in , a reputation as an anti-trade unionist. It states that from  to  there was a succession of disputes as a result of his intransigent attitude, which the Colombian workers find particularly irritating on the part of a foreign representative of a large multinational company. Moreover, the Government was obliged to order that company to pay fines in  and  because of breaches of the labour law.
.The National Union of Employees of Olivetti Colombiana, adds the complainants, protested to the company and to the labour inspectorate, by letter, between  July  and  February , against the company's anti-trade unionist practices. It claims that more than twenty active trade unionists have been wrongfully dismissed since October , often in direct breach of the law. The IMF gives the names of several workers thus dismissed, including one dismissed notwithstanding his trade union immunity (fuero), and of trade unionists who had been victims of other anti-trade union practices such as suspension, transfer and the refusal of normal promotion. It was also stated that the management initiated legal proceedings to obtain the withdrawal of trade union immunity from the president of the union so as to be able to dismiss him. Mr. Bianco is also said to have acquired the habit of insulting union leaders and trying to pick quarrels with them. An assistant manager of the company is even said to have challenged a union leader to a duel. The National Union claims that since  it has been obliged to file more than fifty law suits against the company for non-payment for work on Sundays or public holidays or the normal differential for night work. The union further complains that in order to step up its anti-union pressure the company has withdrawn several privileges already acquired, such as the daily ten-minute rest break.
.The IMF adds that the labour inspector attempted, in vain, to deliver a memorandum from the union to the manager; when the union representatives arranged to be accompanied by two policemen, the latter could only note that the attempt had failed. The complainant emphasises that a multinational company is involved and that flagrant infringements of recognised rights by a subsidiary of such a company have repercussions in other countries. The IMF states that despite visits by labour inspectors and fines, the Colombian Government has not succeeded in making the undertaking see reason, which explains the complaint to ILO.
.The Colombian Government has transmitted in a letter dated  November  a copy of a decision taken on this matter by a labour inspector. This recalls first of all that the President of the National Union of Employees of Olivetti Colombiana S.A. requested an inquiry and sanctions against that company for persecution of a trade union, that an attempt at conciliation had been unsuccessful and that an administrative inquiry had been undertaken. The labour inspector then presents evidence: the preamble of the decision contains extracts from evidence given by workers and it is stated that the employer did not succeed in disproving the allegations made. It is stated that five trade unionists were dismissed between  December  and  April .
.The decision states that right of association is guaranteed and protected by articles  and  of the Labour Code, by Decree No.  of  and certain penal provisions. It then summarises certain facts and notes that the undertaking has clearly committed breaches of the standards for the protection of freedom of association. It points out, amongst other things, that members of the union were subjected to coercion which, although indirect, could not fail to influence the state of mind of every worker and to have an adverse effect on the relationships between the union's leaders and its members. A union leader had been dismissed, despite his immunity, as had five union members in less than four months. Those constituted one of many clear signs of the coercive policy followed by the company to prevent its employees from exercising freely their trade union rights.
.It is also mentioned in the decision that the labour inspectorate had on a number of occasions imposed penalties on the company for infringement of labour law, having become convinced that the latter had been flagrantly and systematically violating the rights acquired by the workers. For these reasons, it had fined the company , pesos for breaches of articles  and  of the Substantive Labour Code and of Decree No.  of .
.It can be seen from the information available that Olivetti Colombiana has committed various acts of anti-trade union discrimination, especially by dismissing or exercising coercion on trade unionists. The Government has communicated the text of a decision by the labour inspectorate, imposing a fine on the company for this reason.
.The Committee considers that, so long as protection against anti-trade union discrimination is effectively provided, the methods adopted to protect workers against such practices may vary from one State to another, but that, if discriminatory practices occur in a country, the Government concerned should, whatever methods may normally be used, take all necessary measures to remedy the situation.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that the right of association is guaranteed and protected by articles  and  of the Labour Code; in addition to providing for penal sanctions, these articles stipulate that the labour administration shall impose fines of  to , pesos on guilty parties. Decree No.  of  December  is complementary to these provisions in that it lists the actions on the part of the employer which are considered as breaches of the right of association. This list consists essentially of the practices referred to in Article  of Convention No. . In addition, articles  to  grant special immunity (fuero sindical) to certain trade union leaders and to the founders of a union as well as to workers who are members of it before the granting of legal status.
.The Committee notes that the labour inspectorate had already imposed penalties on Olivetti Colombiana occasions for systematic violation of the labour law. It notes that in the case under discussion the labour inspectorate, after attempting conciliation, fined the undertaking , pesos for the anti-trade union practices constituting the subject of the complaints.
.Under these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, whilst calling the attention of the Government to the view stated in paragraph  above, to decide that the case calls for no further examination.",0,1974,Colombia
148,".The Committee already examined this case in February , when it presented the definitive conclusions set out in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. As the Government had submitted further information before the examination of that report by the Governing Body at its th Session (May ), the Governing Body decided to postpone its examination of the case.
.The complaint by the Jamaican Union of Bank Employees was submitted by a letter of  May . Additional information was provided by a communication of  June . The Government submitted its observations in communications of  June and  October  and further information by a communication of  May .
.Jamaica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its first communication, the complainant union described various infringements of trade union rights alleged to have been committed in connection with the refusal of the Jamaica Citizens Bank to recognise it. According to the complainants, this Bank had committed acts of anti-union discrimination since  December  in order to prevent its staff from organising in the union of their choice. The acts consisted of threats of dismissal, refusal of salary increases, attempts at infiltration and ""subversion"" of the complainant union. In February , the Union submitted a claim for representational rights and an audited list of its members to the Ministry of Labour. Although the Union established a prima facie case based on the fact that a considerable proportion of the staff was unionised, the Bank refused to attend the meeting to agree to a poll.
.The complainants added that during this period the Ministry of Labour acted merely as a channel for the transmission of the employers' views, instead of seeking rather to find an effective solution to the dispute. The Bank increased its opposition to the union and took action which included the dismissal of a union leader, demotion of the President of the Union, continual transferral of staff without due notice, destruction of union documents and open threats of victimisation. It also sought to refuse certain categories of workers, defined as supervisors and confidential staff, the right to representation by the union, without any legal grounds whatsoever.
.The complainant union then called a strike which, it stated, stopped the ""subversion"" but did not succeed in closing down the operations of the Bank. The Bank maintained its refusal to negotiate and took action to place the Bank's staff club under the control of the management. The Ministry of Labour was said not only to have failed to set up the necessary machinery to deal with the dispute, but also to have collaborated with the employer and to be the first to supply strike breakers. It conducted an investigation in which only managers of the Bank were interviewed, thus providing itself with a false basis on which to refuse to act against the Bank and to justify its reluctance to make full use of the collective bargaining machinery. According to the complainants, the police also collaborated with the Bank: on  April ,  members of the Union were arrested for lying down in the street; four days later, the General Secretary of the Union was assaulted by four police officers while demonstrating in front of the Bank's head office; the same day, a high-level meeting was held between the management of the Bank and senior police officers; two days later, eight strike pickets were arrested and remanded in custody following a telephone call from the management.
.The complainants added that supporters of the union were threatened - both before and during the strike and in collusion with other banks - with the closure of loan accounts and banking facilities. The Minister of Labour was said to have admitted to being almost powerless to do anything because no national laws existed to give him effective authority to settle the dispute.
.In their second communication, the complainants stated that the Bank had drafted lists of strikers and sent them to all the commercial banks on the island so that none of these workers would ever again be employed in a bank. The Bank was also said to have attempted to have members of the Union dismissed from their jobs in other industries such as insurance and tourism, and to have informed various businesses, particularly supermarkets, not to accept the cheques of strikers. The Ministry of Labour had not set up a commission of inquiry, despite requests to do so submitted to it since  April .
.The Government, in its letter of  June , refutes entirely the accusations made against it. It states that a Bill to provide for the development and maintenance of more orderly industrial relations and more effective machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes has been tabled in the House of Representatives.
.The Government supplied more detailed information in its letter of  October . It states that it encourages autonomy in industry and that to this end the Ministry of Labour and Employment provides machinery for the settlement of issues involving trade union representation. With the agreement of the parties concerned, the Ministry may take a poll by secret ballot to determine the wishes of the workers concerned; the agreement usually provides that the outcome of the poll will determine the bargaining position of the parties. A poll may also be taken by the Ministry to determine the number of members of a union in a particular establishment, but no poll can be conducted without the co-operation of the employer. The latter must provide a list of the workers involved and permit ministry officials to enter its premises and conduct such a poll during working hours. The Government stated that the Bill mentioned contains provisions for the compulsory recognition of a trade union which wins a poll. The Government appended to its communication a series of documents concerning its role in the dispute.
.The Government submitted with a communication of  May  a copy of Act No.  of  April  in respect of labour relations and occupational disputes. Section  of this Act provides for court action and a fine not exceeding $, for any person guilty of anti-trade union discrimination. With respect to the representation of workers by one or more trade unions, section  provides that the Minister may, in the event of doubt or dispute, order a poll in order to determine the workers' organisation(s) entitled to negotiate with the employer. If the majority of the workers vote in favour of a union, the employer must recognise its bargaining rights or lay himself open to severe penalties. Several unions may acquire this right in relation to an employer if each receives at least  per cent of the votes. An employer who impedes a vote is punishable with a fine not exceeding $,. If the Minister is unable to settle a dispute regarding the determination of the category of workers concerned by the vote, he must refer the dispute to a court.
.The case thus relates basically to refusal by a bank to recognise the complainant union as representing its staff, despite intervention by the Government. According to the complainant, the employer was guilty of anti-trade union practices before and during the subsequent strike. In addition, strike pickets were arrested.
.Regarding these arrests, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the workers are authorised to place peaceful strike pickets, but that in the case under discussion the pickets had blocked the entrance to the bank and traffic in the street, had refused to go away and had used threatening and insulting language towards the police. The Committee also notes that they were found guilty by the courts and then released.
.The Committee also notes that the Government's reply contains no specific information on the anti-trade union acts by the Bank, particularly prior to the strike. The Committee has already pointed out, in another case relating to Jamaica, that complaints concerning anti-union practices should normally be examined by appropriate machinery. The Committee notes that the new Act of  April  provides for recourse to a court and severe sanctions in the event of anti-union activities. The Committee considers that this new Act can be expected to prevent the practices which the complainants allege have been used by the employer.
.Regarding refusal by the Bank to recognise the complainant union, the Committee recalls that it has on several occasions examined similar complaints relating to Jamaica. The information available in these cases, as confirmed by the first information communicated by the Government in the present case, shows that in any case the Ministry could not organise a poll in order to determine the representative union(s) entitled to conduct collective bargaining, without the collaboration of the employer. In the case under discussion the employer refused his collaboration and thus prevented a poll being organised.
.The Committee has pointed out, in similar cases concerning Jamaica, the importance which it attaches to",1,1974,Jamaica
149,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.
.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May ",-1,1974,Dominican Republic
150,"abuses that might result from the creation of a monopoly should be left to the judicial authorities.
.In their communications, the ICFTU, the WCL, the WFTU and the CLAT refer to the ban on May Day celebrations imposed by the Government. The complaining organisations state that when the police intervened during demonstrations in Santiago, people were injured and more than  were arrested. In Valparaiso, too, more than  workers were arrested.
.The complainants also state that the international trade union Confederations and several of their affiliates had sent delegations to manifest their solidarity with the Chilean workers. The delegates from the CLAT and from a number of Spanish Confederations were refused entry on their arrival in Chile.
.The Government remarks that on  May the legislation on the freedom of assembly of trade union organisations was already in force. The Minister of Labour had publicly stated that the workers could celebrate Labour Day at meetings of their organisations. The Minister of the Interior, for his part, refused to authorise a meeting in the streets that a group of persons including several trade union leaders had expressed the wish to organise. This meeting had been described as an ""artistic and cultural gathering"". However, owing to the political nature of statements made by the organisers, the Government considered that it was its duty not to authorise such a gathering, in accordance with the provisions concerning the keeping of the peace.
.The Government points out that in Chile authorisation has always been required for the holding of peaceful gatherings in public places. Certain leaders had accordingly stated that if they did not obtain authorisation to hold the meeting they would not participate in any action in breach of the traditional standards of public order. However, another group preferred to exploit May Day for political purposes, called for the breaking off of the dialogue with the Government and provoked the authorities into refusing permission for the meeting. This group organised a rally of  persons.
.The disturbances which followed, and in particular the physical assaults upon the police, led to the arrest of  persons, including  students,  white-collar workers and technicians,  housewives,  self-employed persons,  persons without any known occupation and  wage earners. No trade union officials were arrested. Fifty-two persons were prosecuted ( for assaults on policemen and  for breaches of the State Security Act). All the others were released by order of the judicial authorities.
.The Government remarks that at that very moment the labour authorities were meeting with , trade union officials to analyse the most important features of the new laws to be adopted shortly.
.In conclusion, the Government states that it is untrue to assert that it banned the celebrating of May Day. Far to the contrary, it reminded trade unions that they were absolutely free to hold meetings all over the country to commemorate this important date.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that the  persons remaining in custody have been released by decision of the Court of Appeal of Santiago, against which the Government will not appeal.
.The Committee notes that the persons arrested during the May Day demonstrations have now all been released. It nevertheless wishes to emphasise, as it has done on countless occasions, and in particular in connection with the present case, that the right to organise public meetings and processions on May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights, provided the legal provisions on public order are observed. The Committee further draws attention to the fact that the Government has not furnished observations on the allegations concerning the expulsion of foreign trade unionists who had come to celebrate May Day in Chile. Although governments have a sovereign right to decide who shall and who shall not be admitted to their territory in accordance with the legislation applicable to aliens in general, the Committee wishes nevertheless to stress the importance it attaches to the right of national trade unions to maintain relations with occupational organisations in other countries and international Confederations.
.At various stages in the examination of this case, the Committee has examined allegations concerning the detention or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists. In a report examined by the Committee in November , the Government provided information on  of the  persons mentioned in the list established by the Committee in its th Report. In February , the Government stated that there were no trade unionists detained in Chile. At that time the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to continue to supply information on the persons mentioned in the th Report, and in particular on the results of the efforts made to trace missing persons.
.In this connection the Government states that on  March , the Supreme Court instructed the Court of Appeal of Santiago to appoint one of its judges to undertake a special mission to investigate and pronounce decisions on cases of persons presumed missing still pending in the courts within its jurisdiction. These cases involve, inter alia, the following persons: Jos Luis Baeza, Carlos Contreras Maluje, Hctor Manuel Contreras, Jos Corvaln, Juan Elias Cortez, Uldarico Donaire, Jaime Patricio Donato, Humberto Fuentes, Mario Jess Juica, Guillermo Glvez, Fernando Lara, Guillermo Martinet, Juan Moraga, Miguel Morales, Miguel Nazal, Rodolfo Marcial Nuez, Luis Recabarren G, Manuel Recabarren R, Raimundo Riquelme, Jorge Salgado, Jos Santander, Pedro Silva Bustos, Jorge Solovera, Jos Toloza, Julio Roberto Vega, Carlos Vizcarra, Jos Arturo Weibel, Ricardo Weibel, Juan Gianelli, Carlos Lorca Tobar, Exequiel Ponce, Jos Sagredo Pacheco, Fernando Navarro, Waldo Pizarro and Fernando Ortiz. The Supreme Court has issued the same instruction to the Court of Appeal of Talca with respect to the case of Luis Eduardo Vega Ramirez. The Government will communicate the results of the proceedings pending in due course.
.The Committee notes that judges of the courts of appeal of Santiago and, Talca are investigating the cases of missing persons, most of whom have been mentioned in the complaints before the Committee it once again requests the Government to continue to supply information as to the results of the efforts made to trace these persons, and, in general, on the persons mentioned in the list included by the Committee in its th Report.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the adoption of new trade union legislation:(i) to note with interest that the guiding principles announced by the Government in preparing the new trade union legislation took account of the principles set out in the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(ii) to express its regret that the Government has not found it possible to supply the text of the Bill before it becomes law;(iii) to urge the Government to take all the necessary measures so that the provisions of the new legislation will comply with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and so that they will be adopted as soon as possible, and that the text will be sent promptly to the Committee so that it can evaluate their conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(iv) to insist on the need for this legislation to be brought into force speedily and fully so as to put an end to the restrictions on trade unions;(b) as regards the right to hold meetings;(i) to note with interest the adoption of Legislative Decree No.  to supplement Legislative Decree No.  as concerns the right to hold meetings in trade union premises, without previous authorisation;(ii) however, to point out that trade unions ought to have the right to freely organise meetings either in trade union premises or in other appropriate premises;(c) with regard to collective bargaining:(i) to note that the Government confirms that the new law on the subject will be promulgated not later than  June ;(ii) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above as concerns the level at which collective bargaining would take place;(d) with regard to the removal from office of on Lillo:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above as concerns measures for the removal from office of trade union officials;(ii) to request the Government to supply information as to the results of the administrative inquiry carried out by the customs authorities;(e) with regard to the dissolution of several trade union organisations, to request the Government to supply information as to the outcome of the appeals pending in the courts and as to the ultimate destination of the assets of the dissolved organisations;(f) with regard to the incidents which occurred on May Day :(i) to note that all the persons arrested are now at liberty;(ii) to recall that the right to organise public meetings and processions on May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights, provided the legal provisions on public order are observed;(iii) to stress the importance of the right of national trade unions to maintain relations with occupational organisations in other countries",0,1975,Chile
151,"and international Confederations;(g) with regard to the detention or disappearance of serving or former trade union officials, to note that judges of the courts of appeal of Santiago and Talca have been instructed to investigate the cases of missing persons, including many trade unionists, and to request the Government to continue to supply information as to the results of the proceedings pending and, in general, on the persons mentioned in the list included by the Committee in its th report;(h) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee last examined this case at its November  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Since it last examined the case, the ILO transmitted to the Government for its comments communications from the complainant organisations concerning the measures taken by the Government in regard to trade union matters in October . The communications in question were from the World Federation of Trade Unions (dated  October ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (dated  October ), the International Metalworkers' Federation (dated  October ), the International Federation of Textile, Garment and Leather workers (dated  October ), and the Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (dated  November ). The ILO also transmitted a letter from the United Front of Chilean Workers (dated  December ) and communications from the World Federation of Trade Unions and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions dated  December  and  January , respectively, supporting the allegations made by a Committee for the defence of trade union rights in Santiago de Chile in a letter dated  October . Moreover, the World Confederation of Labour transmitted, on  December , a communication from the Latin American Federation of Textile, Clothing, Footwear, Leather and Allied Workers referring to the same facts as the allegations previously received from the other complainants.
.For its part, the Government forwarded information and comments in communications dated  November ,  and  January  and ,  and  February . It should also be recalled that the Government had sent a report dated  October  which the Committee had been unable to examine in depth at its November  Session.I. Question of the adoption of new trade union legislation
.In a statement made in October , which the Committee had noted at its last session, the Minister of Labour had announced that the draft Labour Code was nearing completion and that the Government had adopted a legislative decree which guarantees full freedom for workers to establish trade unions.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee, noted that the new trade union legislation was nearing completion and expressed the hope that the Committee would be able to examine this at its February  Session and that it would be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.In its communication dated  January , the Government indicates that the Minister of Labour has received and studied reports of the Council of State regarding trade union rights and collective bargaining. In an annex to this communication it is stated that the competent Committee of the Council of State held talks with numerous leaders of national organisations of workers and employers in different sectors of activity. The list of persons consulted shows that the workers' leaders heard by the Committee belonged to various trends in the trade union movement.
.The Government also declares that the draft reform of the political Constitution is currently being examined by the Council of State. The final text will contain basic standards relating to trade union rights and collective bargaining it will be submitted to a referendum.
.The present Minister of Labour, appointed at the end of , made public in a statement made on  January  in the presence of leaders of workers' and employers' organisations, the substance of the ""Social Plan"" setting out the Government's basic objectives and decisions regarding the establishment of a new institutional system for labour matters.
.In its communication dated  January  the Government states that the process of working out the ways and means of implementing this ""Social Plan"" has involved numerous meetings with workers' and employers' leaders. In addition, a high-level special Committee has been set up to collect the proposals submitted by leaders representing the various trends and to submit as soon as it can conclusions concerning the final draft of the trade union legislation.
.The principles underlying this ""Social Plan"", as given out by the Minister of Labour, should lead to a system of trade unionism with the following characteristics:- Free trade unionism, which means the right of the workers to act collectively through trade unions formed and organised according to the wishes of their members with no other restrictions than those established by law to ensure respect of the common good and the proper functions of the trade unions. This freedom entails as corollaries the right of the worker to join or leave a trade union by the voluntary and intransmissible exercise of his own free will, as well as the right of the trade union assembly to act as the central decision-making body of the trade union. As regards the number of trade unions that there may be in an undertaking and the right to form federations and Confederations, the law will have to lay down standards which allow the workers the variety they desire and at the same time meet the requirements for a rational and efficient functioning of the economy and the undertakings.- Democratic trade unionism, which means the freedom of the members to appoint their executive organs and the guarantee that the latter act in conformity with the decisions taken by the members.- Trade unionism endowed with resources, which means the obligation of the members to pay contributions to their organisation. Such contributions could be made by deduction at source by decision of each member in the case of a works union and of the majority of the members in the case of federations and Confederations.- Independent and depoliticised trade unionism. This must exclude any use of the trade union organisation by groups or interests which are foreign to it, whatever their nature or origin. In view of past experience it is imperative not to permit the politicisation of trade unions and the prevent their being directed by persons engaged in party political activities or propagating doctrines contrary to the fundamentals of the institutional system. Decisions concerning each individual case of ineligibility and incompatibility will rest with independent tribunals. To offset these restrictions, the elected trade union leader will enjoy guarantees ensuring his independence in the exercise of his functions.
.In presenting the general outline of this ""Social Plan"", the Minister indicated that the law respecting trade union organisations would be enacted for  June . Its enactment forms part of a gradual process which in the immediate future means establishing the widest possible freedom of assembly and adopting standards designed to facilitate the payment of workers' contributions to their unions.
.The Minister of Labour indeed announced the adoption of a resolution of the Minister of the interior, dated  January , addressed to all the country's provincial administrators and governors, whereby all the executives of trade union organisations, be they trade unions, federations or Confederations, are authorised to hold ordinary or extraordinary meetings with their members to deal with the organisation's affairs without it being necessary to request prior authorisation from the competent authorities. Such meetings must be held at union headquarters and outside working hours. The provisions have been taken up again in Legislative Decree No.  published in the Official Journal on  February ; the Legislative Decree abrogates, moreover, section  of Legislative Decree No.  relating to union meetings. It specifies that, if the organisation has no premises in which to hold its meetings, it can hold them in private premises provided that previous notification is given to the nearest police station. The provisions in question equally apply to associations of public servants as well as to employee groups in the public or semi-public sectors.
.Legislative decree No.  was also promulgated on  February  with a view to granting facilities to workers' organisations to enable them to collect contributions from their members without delay. The system adopted provides for the possibility of using, on a voluntary basis, the system of deduction of contributions at source by the employer. According to the Government, this arrangement has been favourably received both by the employer and by the workers it also applies to union organisations in agriculture as well as to public servant associations. Lastly, Legislative Decree No.  provides that the affiliation of a trade union to an organ of higher level must be decided by an absolute majority of unionists during a",0,1975,Chile
152,"meeting especially called for this purpose at which an Inspector of Labour or Notary must be present. The decision to affiliate must be reviewed every two years and decisions to collect trade union contributions by federations and Confederations must be ratified by first degree general meetings to be of effect.
.The Government indicates finally, that it will provide more detailed information on the new trade union legislation for the next session of the Committee, since by then it will be in a position to give exact details of the content of the standards to be adopted once all the opinions have been heard.
.The Committee notes the statement of the Minister of Labour according to which the new trade union legislation is due to be adopted before  June . The Committee considers, in the light of the information provided by the Government, that the main principles underlying this legislation should permit the adoption of provisions ensuring greater respect of the principles of freedom of association than those which were in force. In addition, the Committee notes with interest that provisions have been adopted with a view to guaranteeing freedom of assembly for trade union organisations. It also notes that a legislative decree to facilitate the collection of trade union contributions has been promulgated.
.The Committee will not, however, be able to express its opinion in full knowledge of the facts as to whether the new trade union legislation is in conformity with the generally recognised principles on the matter until it is in possession of the complete text of the relevant provisions. The Committee notes in this regard the assurance given by the Government that more detailed information will be provided for its next session. In this context, and bearing in mind the concerns expressed within the ILO in regard to the trade union situation in Chile, the Committee cannot overemphasise the importance of its being able to examine the provisions of the legislation before their envisaged promulgation in June . It therefore expresses the firm hope that the Government will be in a position, for its next session, to provide it with all the information necessary for a thorough examination of the draft legislation as well as the measures envisaged by the Government for implementing the new law.
.In the meantime, the Committee considers it useful to recall the recommendations formulated by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission respecting the adoption of new trade union legislation. The Commission had considered that such legislation should, to be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association enshrined in the Constitution of the ILO and in order to be able to ratify the freedom of association Conventions, should recognise, in particular, the following principles:
.The Committee must also stress the value of systematic and thorough consultation of employers' and workers' organisations in the course of drafting trade union legislation. In this respect, the Committee notes that the Minister of Labour held talks with leaders representing various trends in the trade union movement as well as with employers' representatives.
.Finally, the Committee must point out that it would be highly desirable for the new legislation to be implemented in full as rapidly as possible so as to put an end to the major restrictions which have been imposed on trade union organisations since .II. Trade union activities(a) Collective bargaining.In a speech delivered in October , the Minister of Labour had indicated that the country was preparing to restore collective bargaining in a new and modern way which would render it more effective in a really free society. According to the Minister, such progress had been made possible by the success with which the Government and the people of Chile had overcome the economic catastrophe in the country. Collective bargaining would take place at the level of the undertaking.
.In a speech delivered in October , the Minister of Labour had indicated that the country was preparing to restore collective bargaining in a new and modern way which would render it more effective in a really free society. According to the Minister, such progress had been made possible by the success with which the Government and the people of Chile had overcome the economic catastrophe in the country. Collective bargaining would take place at the level of the undertaking.
.At their November  Session, the Committee and the Governing Body had expressed the hope that, when restoring collective bargaining, the Government would take account of the principles expressed by the Committee concerning compulsory arbitration which would be contrary to freedom of association.
.In presenting the Government's ""Social Plan"" at the beginning of January , the minister of Labour stated that what had to be aimed for was a system of collective bargaining which would be:- effective and just, which would suggest that it be conducted within each undertaking, without prejudice to the exceptions strictly necessary in the case of activities where such an arrangement would not be viable;- technical, which would require that both parties with full knowledge of the relevant factors involved and with the aid of any technical assistance required;- responsible and integrated, which can only be achieved within the framework of conciliation procedures since experience proved that mediation and arbitration arrangements did not enjoy the necessary confidence to facilitate equitable and peaceful solution of wage negotiations. Because of this, strikes proliferated to the extent that, instead of being the last resort in an unresolved conflict, they became a regular and immediate means of seeking a solution to such dispute. It is clear that striking cannot be legally accepted when it affects services in the public interest or when a work stoppage seriously impairs the population's health or food supplies, the country's economy or national security. In requiring compulsory arbitration in these cases, Chile is following the pattern prevailing in the most advanced democracies in this field. On the other hand, the situation is different in undertakings where strikes do not have such effects on society and where the problem is confined to a dispute between employers and workers without vitally affecting the State or the population. In these cases, there is nothing preventing the possibility of occupational strikes and lock-outs.
.In winding up this point, the Minister of Labour pointed out that his statements on collective bargaining did not concern employees of the State and municipalities. Finally, he indicated that the legislation respecting collective bargaining would enter into force before  June .
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government on this point, in particular regarding the early adoption of new legislation on collective bargaining. The Committee also notes with interest that, according to the statements of the Minister of Labour, the procedure of compulsory arbitration would not be applied to all collective labour disputes, contrary to what had been previously announced, but only to limited cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee expresses the hope that the re-establishment of collective bargaining which the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission had already declared to be a general aspiration of trade union circles, will be effective in the very near future. In the opinion of the Committee, this would constitute an important factor in improving industrial relations in the country.
.The Committee noted nevertheless that, according to the statement of the Minister of Labour, the framework for collective bargaining will be mainly at the level of the undertaking. In this regard, the Committee considers it useful to point out that the law should not stand in the way of the participation of federations and Confederations in voluntary collective negotiations concerning conditions of work.(b) Allegations concerning collective labour disputes
.Some of the complainant organisations, and in particular the ICFTU and the WFTU, had referred to collective labour disputes which had recently taken place in Chile, particularly in the mining sector at Chuquicamata. The complainants explained that, after two years of fruitless action to obtain higher wages, the workers of Chuquicamata had submitted, on  August , a list of the following social and economic demands: a  per cent increase in wages, an increase in the residence allowance, an increase in the production bonus and scholarships for children who were studying. The management of the public mining undertaking reacted by dismissing trade union leaders who had taken part in the assembly during which the list of demands had been approved. In protest against these measures and against the prices of meals in the undertaking, the miners began what has been known as the ""canteen strike"", refusing to take their meals in the canteens of the undertaking.
.Following this movement, the Government declared a state of siege throughout the province. This measure had various consequences, in particular the obligation to submit a duly justified written request for the holding of any meeting or assembly, to be presented  hours in advance to the Garrison Commander. Movements of persons within the province and leaving the province were controlled, as was entry to the mines, to which only the workers were allowed access. In addition, workers were arrested, sent to a remote part of the country, or placed under house arrest.
.In",0,1975,Chile
153,".The complaint from the Latin American Central of Workers and that from the World Confederation of Labour were submitted in communications dated  January  and  February , respectively. The Government submitted its observations by a communication of  September .
.Colombia has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants state that the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) has been waiting since  for the granting of legal personality, although it has fulfilled all the conditions foreseen by law for that purpose. They submitted in support of their allegations a photocopy of documents from various departments of the Ministry of Labour, which confirm that the legal provisions have been respected and support the recognition of the CGT.
.The Government states in its reply that the CGT received legal personality by resolution No.  of  July .
.The Committee has already had to examine several cases relating to Colombia in which a workers' organisation had difficulty in obtaining legal recognition. It must also be added that under the national Labour Code, legal personality is essential for a trade union organisation to be able to act as such. In the present case, a period of about four years elapsed, without any explanation from the Government, between the application for the granting of legal personality and obtention of this status by the CGT.
.The problem is bound up with the principle that workers' organisations are entitled to form federations and Confederations or to join them and the principle that the acquisition of legal personality by trade unions, their federations and Confederations shall not be subject to any condition of such a nature as to restrict this right. The Committee considers in particular that whilst it is true that the founders of a trade union must comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to hamper freedom to form organisations.
.Subject to the reservation expressed in the preceding paragraph, the Committee, noting that the situation out of which the complaint arose has been dealt with, considers that it would be pointless for it to pursue the matter further and accordingly recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1975,Colombia
154,"establish trade unions. In future, the setting up of a trade union would be decided by more than  per cent of established workers in an establishment or enterprise. This percentage should not represent less than  workers. Non-unionised workers will be represented by the works delegate and will contribute to the expenses connected with the collective agreement. The distinction that, up to now, existed between unions of workers and employees will be abolished. A special statute has been adopted for public servants.
.The Committee notes the statement that the draft Labour Code is nearing completion and that henceforth a legislative decree adopted by the Government guarantees freedom to workers to establish trade unions. The Committee hopes that it will be able to examine the provisions of the new Labour Code at its next session and that these will be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association, and in particular, with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission.II. Trade union activities in the country(a) Collective bargaining.The Government had stated in its earlier report that the country's economic situation had considerably improved. Nevertheless, conditions were not yet suitable for the reestablishment of the normal collective bargaining machinery, which was to remain suspended until  March . The Government further stated that a new system of collective bargaining was in an advanced stage of consideration. The system of automatically readjusting remuneration at quarterly intervals continued to be applied, as did the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  of , which extended the scope of agreements in writing, collective agreements, arbitration awards and tripartite Committee decisions to all workers in the branch of activity concerned.
.The Government had stated in its earlier report that the country's economic situation had considerably improved.

The system of automatically readjusting remuneration at quarterly intervals continued to be applied, as did the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  of , which extended the scope of agreements in writing, collective agreements, arbitration awards and tripartite Committee decisions to all workers in the branch of activity concerned.
.With regard to the tripartite Committees, the Government referred to the information already supplied in November  to the effect that their decisions were now accorded deliberative status. It confirmed that it was the task of the government representatives on these Committees to safeguard the general interest by preventing excesses prejudicial to the community. However, the role played by the State would gradually become more and more secondary.
.The Minister of Labour further told the representative of the Director-General that restoration of collective bargaining would perhaps take place in  and that the provisions which would require to be taken to this effect were being studied. It was foreseen that in case the parties did not reach agreement, either directly or through mediation, recourse would be had to arbitration as a final solution. The arbitrators would be nominated by agreement between the parties or by independent bodies such as the courts.
.At its May  Session, the Committee noted with interest the trend in favour of restoration of collective bargaining. Nevertheless, it pointed out that what seemed to be envisaged was that, in the absence of an agreement between the parties in the collective bargaining process, the dispute which would result would be dealt with by compulsory arbitration. In other words, recourse to strikes would be prohibited. The Committee recalled the recent statement made by the minister of Labour according to which recognition of the right to strike would also be examined within the framework of the process of normalisation. In this connection the Committee recalled that the right to strike constituted one of the essential elements whereby workers and their organisations might promote and defend their occupational interests. While a prohibition of the right to strike might be acceptable during collective bargaining or during the validity of a collective agreement or in the case of public servants or essential services, a general prohibition of the right to strike would be contrary to the principles of freedom of association.
.In his speech of  October  the Minister stated that the country was preparing to restore collective bargaining in a new and modern way which would render it more effective in a really free society. According to the Minister, such progress had been made possible by the success with which the Government and the people of Chile have overcome the economic catastrophe in the country. Collective bargaining will take place at the level of the undertaking. The Minister also pointed out that the trade union elections would enable collective bargaining to take place with a more solid representation for Chilean workers.
.The Committee notes the statements made by the Minister of Labour regarding this question. These confirm the information already provided by the Government at the last session of the Committee. The Committee hopes that, when restoring collective bargaining, the Government will take account of the principles and considerations expressed by the Committee at its last session concerning compulsory arbitration for collective disputes in general, which would be contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(b) Collective labour disputes
.Some of the complainant organisations referred to collective labour disputes which had recently taken place in Chile. For example, in a telegram of  September , the ICFTU states that following a strike by the miners of the Chuquicamata copper mine, the authorities declared a state of siege in the region, arrested  workers and dismissed others.
.In its three communications of September , the WFTU also refers to the situation in the Chuquicamata mining sector. The complainant organisation explains that, after two years of fruitless action to obtain higher wages, the workers of Chuquicamata submitted, on  August , a list of the following social and economic demands: a  per cent increase in wages, an increase in the residence allowance, an increase in the production bonus and scholarships for children who were studying. The management of the public mining undertaking reacted by dismissing trade union leaders who had taken part in the assembly during which the list of demands had been approved. In protest against these measures and against the prices of meals in the undertaking, the miners began what has been known as the ""canteen strike"", refusing to take their meals in the canteens of the undertaking.
.Following this movement, the Government declared a state of siege throughout the province. This measure had various consequences, in particular the obligation to submit a duly justified written request for the holding of any meeting or assembly, to be presented  hours in advance to the Garrison Commander. Movements of persons within the province and leaving the province were controlled, as was entry to the mines, to which only the workers were allowed access. In addition, six workers were arrested and sent to a remote part of the country, and three others were placed under house arrest. The number of arrests increased, continues the WFTU, reaching  on  September. The complainants supplied a list of  persons who were arrested on charges of ""political activism"" and adds that further arrests have reportedly been made of miners who are presumed to be active in the Christian Democratic and Communist Parties. In addition, according to the WFTU,  miners have been threatened with dismissal.
.The WFTU reports that talks between the Government and the copper miners' leaders have been interrupted, and that the chairman of the CODELCO public copper undertaking did not attend the meeting with the trade union leaders, which was scheduled to be held in Santiago.
.Finally, the complainant organisation refers to a further ""canteen strike"" which is said to have been followed by about a thousand of the , workers of the Huachipato works of the Pacific Steel public undertaking for the purpose of obtaining a  per cent over-all increase in pay. This claim was presented to the undertaking a few months ago.
.The texts of the communications transmitted by the complainant organisations concerning this matter were sent to the Government, which transmitted certain information thereon in a report dated  October . It states, in particular, that the dispute has been settled through negotiations and that the workers who were dismissed have been reinstated. In addition the workers who were arrested have been released.
.The Committee notes this information. It proposes to examine this question in a more detailed manner at its next session.(c) Trade union elections
.Several complainant organisations, in particular the ICFTU, the WCL and the WFTU, sent, on ,  and  October , telegrams to the ILO protesting against the method employed by the Government in organising the trade union elections on  October . The ICFTU and the WCL state that the , trade union leaders presently in office are unable to present their candidatures. According to the ICFTU this is a trick by",0,1975,Chile
155,"of trade union rights
.At various stages in the examination of this case, the Committee examined allegations concerning the detention and disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists. In its report of  October , the Government had provided information on  of the  persons mentioned in the list established by the Committee in its th Report. While noting this information the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to continue to supply information on the persons appearing on this list.
.In its communication of  February , the Government states that there are no trade unionists actually detained in Chile. Regarding the persons who are presumed disappeared, it indicates that it will continue to keep the ILO informed of the result of the searches underway and of the cases instituted before the judiciary.
.The Committee notes this statement made by the Government and requests it to continue to supply information on the persons appearing on this list, in particular on the results of the efforts made to trace the missing persons.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the adoption of new trade union legislation:(i) to note that this is due to be adopted before  June ;(ii) to note with interest that two legislative decrees covering organisations in every sector were adopted on  February  to guarantee the right of trade unions to meet and to favour the collection of members' fees;(iii) to recall to the Government's attention the recommendations formulated by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission concerning the adoption of new trade union legislation, cited in paragraph  above;(iv) to express the firm hope that the Government will be able to provide all the necessary information for a thorough examination of the Bill and the measures envisaged for its application by the Committee at its next session;(b) as regards collective bargaining, to point out to the Government the principles and considerations expressed in paragraphs  and  above, and to express the hope that collective bargaining will be restored in the very near future;(c) as regards the collective dispute at Chuquicamata, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations expressed in paragraphs  to , and to decide that, taking into account the agreement reached between the parties, further examination of this aspect of the case would be pointless;(d) as regards trade union elections:(i) to stress that the right of workers organisations to elect freely their leaders constitutes an indispensable condition for them to be able in fact to act in full freedom and to promote effectively the interests of their members, and to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraphs  to  above;(ii) to point out that the exclusions practised in the elections of October  were not in conformity with these principles;(iii) to note, however, the statement of the Government that new elections could be held in the trade unions concerned on the basis of the new trade union legislation that will not include different types of exclusions required in the elections of October ;(e) as regards the removal from office and dismissal of the trade union leaders:(i) to note that an agreement was concluded between the copper workers leaders mentioned in the complaints and the CODELCO undertaking, and to decide that, for this reason, further examination of this aspect of the case would be pointless;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the principle whereby public sector workers should enjoy the right to organise and adequate protection against acts of antiunion discrimination;(f) as regards the dissolution of several trade union organisations, to note that an appeal has been lodged by them in the courts, and to request the Government to provide information on the results of these judicial proceedings and on the subsequent allocation of the assets of the dissolved organisations;(g) as regards the detention or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists, to note the statement of the Government in paragraph  and request it to continue to supply information on the persons appearing on the list established by the Committee in its th Report, in particular on the results of the efforts made to trace missing persons;(h) to take note of this interim report.
.The last report sent by the Government of Chile under article  of the ILO Constitution concerning the measures taken to give effect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission was examined by the Committee and the Governing Body at their May-June  Session. On this occasion the Committee also examined Case No. . It is appropriate to recall that the Committee examined the matters at issue taking account of the information gathered by the representative of the Director-General during a direct contact mission between  and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At the May-June  Session the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the trade union situation by  October  and its observations on the allegations made in Case No. .
.Since it last examined the case, the Committee has received communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( September,  and  October ), the World Federation of Trade Unions (, ,  September and  October ), the World Confederation of Labour ( and  October ), the International Union of Workers in Agriculture, Forests and Plantations ( October ), the International Union of Public Service and Allied Workers ( October ), the International Union of Building, Wood and Construction workers ( October ), the Latin American Central of Workers ( October ), and the International Union of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers ( October ). The Government sent, by a communication dated  October , the text of certain statements made by the Minister of Labour. The Government also sent a report dated  October  and a communication dated  November . Because of the late date on which these communications were received the Committee was unable to examine these at its present session. It proposes to examine the matters raised in these communications in a more detailed manner at its next session.
.Because the new allegations submitted by the new organisations within the context of Case No.  cover various important aspects of trade union life, the Committee decided to examine the questions relating to the evolution of the trade union situation and the case before it concerning Chile in a single document.I. Question of the adoption of new trade union legislation
.In its previous report the Government had stated that Book II of the draft Labour Code, which deals with trade union rights, was being examined by the Council of State, which had reported on the question around the middle of . The Government further indicated that the ministry of Labour was finalising the text of these provisions. In this connection the authorities told the representative of the Director-General that the promulgation of new trade union legislation was part of a process of evolution of which the first stage would be the adoption of a new system of collective bargaining.
.At its May  Session, the Committee, while taking note of the developments in the trade union situation and, in particular, of the Government's intention to restore collective bargaining, pointed out that a system of collective bargaining presupposed the absence of restrictions on the legitimate activities of trade union organisations, especially as regards their internal administration. Such a system presupposed, in particular, that trade union organisations should be able freely to call meetings and should be represented in the course of negotiations by leaders who were freely elected by their members. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, pointed out to the Government that one of its priorities should be the repeal of Legislative Decree No.  and the promulgation, as soon as possible, of legislation in conformity with the principles of the ILO.
.In a statement made on  October  the Minister of Labour reaffirmed that freedom of association was one of the main orientations in the new institutional labour system and that there could only be restrictions of this freedom on grounds affecting the general interest. The new concept of trade unionism, stated the Minister, fully recognises the right of occupational organisations to protect their legitimate interests provided that they adopt a responsible attitude. This attitude necessarily implies that their interests are compatible with the common good, a fact which eliminates the systematic development of social conflict, but which, on the other hand, implies the seeking of solutions to social conflicts by means that are peaceful and just.
.The minister announced that the draft Labour Code was nearing completion and that the Government had adopted a legislative decree which guarantees full freedom of workers to",0,1975,Chile
156,"Union of Textile and Clothing Workers, the Industrial Federation of Building, Wood and Construction Workers and the Industrial National Federation of Mineworkers. The organisations are dissolved and their legal personality removed. The same applies to their affiliates. Their assets are transferred to the State.
.Whatever the reasons invoked by the Government in the legislative decree dissolving these organisations, the Committee must point out that the procedure followed in these cases for the dissolution of these organisations is not compatible with the principle that workers' organisations should not be dissolved by administrative authority. The measures taken are of a particularly serious nature since affiliated organisations are also affected under the legislative decree, and their assets transferred to the state (article  of the decree). Accordingly, the Committee would request the Government to provide, as soon as possible, its observations on this aspect of the case.IV. Civil liberties relevant to the exercise of trade union rights
.In its previous report the Government had stated that the state of siege had not been prolonged on  March . The country was thus governed by the provisions relating to a state of emergency, which were more flexible than those providing for a state of siege. The Government had also stated that it hoped that it would be possible for the restrictions associated with the state of emergency to be eliminated to the extent practicable within the near future. The government authorities had stressed to the representative of the Director-General the importance which should be attached to the amnesty granted in accordance with Decree No.  of  April .
.At its June  Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, noted with interest the measures taken by the Government, especially as regards the amnesty, and expressed the hope that other measures would be adopted, as soon as possible, in order to fully establish the exercise of civil rights, thus permitting the return to a normal trade union situation.
.As regards the allegations concerning the detention or the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists, the Committee, in May , regretted that it had been unable to note from the information supplied by the Government that any progress had been made as regards the supply of the information expected concerning the persons mentioned in the present case who were said to have been detained or who had disappeared. Furthermore, the Committee noted the contradictions between the statements made by the Government and those made by the complainants who had supplied various details concerning the detention of numerous trade unionists or former trade unionists who had subsequently disappeared. The Committee also noted that a number of habeas corpus applications were being dealt with by the courts concerning persons who had disappeared and that the authorities would inform the ILO as to the full scope of these judicial procedures. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to continue its investigations in order to trace the missing persons and to transmit information on the results of the judicial proceedings that were taking place.
.In its report dated  October  the Government provides information on  out of the  persons named in the latest list established by the Committee while noting this information the Committee wishes to request the Government to continue to supply information on the persons appearing on this list.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the adoption of new trade union legislation, to note that this legislation is nearing completion and to express the hope that the Committee will be able to examine this at its next session, and that it will be in full conformity with the principles of freedom of association;(b) as regards collective bargaining, to express the hope that the Government, in restoring collective bargaining, will take account of the principles and considerations expressed by the Committee at its previous session concerning compulsory arbitration for collective disputes;(c) as regards the allegations concerning collective labour disputes, to note that the Committee will make a more detailed examination, at its next session, of the information provided by the Government on this matter;(d) as regards the allegations concerning the trade union elections, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above; and to request it to transmit information concerning the reasons for fixing certain cases of ineligibility in the legislative decree on elections;(e) as regards the allegations relative to the removal from office or dismissal of trade union leaders, to note that the Committee will, at its next session, examine the text of the judgement in the cases of Juan Fincheira, Milton Puga, Carlos Arellano and Arturo Latuz;(f) as regards the allegations concerning the dissolution of trade union organisations, to point out that the procedure followed in these cases was incompatible with the principle that workers' organisations should not be dissolved by administrative authority, and to request the Government to provide its observations on this question as soon as possible;(g) as regards the allegations concerning the detention or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists, to note the information provided by the Government and to request it to continue to supply information on the persons appearing on the latest list established by the Committee in its th Report; and(h) to take note of this interim report.
.The last report submitted by the Government of Chile under article  of the ILO Constitution on the measures taken to comply with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission was examined by the Committee and the Governing Body at their November  session.,
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At that session the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, and to submit a report on this subject by  April .The Government supplied this report in a communication dated  March .Additional information was provided by the Government in communications dated  and  April .
.Following consultations between the Government of Chile and the Director-General it was decided to have recourse to the direct contacts procedure. The Director-General appointed Mr. Luis Segovia, official of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him on this mission. Interviews were held between  and  May .
.In the course of his mission, the representative of the Director-General met with the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, the Secretary of State and the Adviser for International Affairs of this Ministry. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Justice, and the Secretary of State for the interior. He was also able to have interviews with a number of former ministers of labour. In the premises of the trade unions he met workers' leaders who belonged to various trends in the trade union world. Finally, at the headquarters of the Confederation for Production and Commerce he met with the president of this central employers' organisation and with the leaders of affiliated organisations which cover a number of branches of activity including agriculture, commerce and construction.
.The representative of the Director-General was afforded all the necessary facilities by the authorities. During his interviews with the authorities and with the employers' and workers' leaders great interest was demonstrated by all of them in the direct contacts mission, and they expressed the hope that this mission could make a contribution to the normalisation of the trade union situation in the country. On various occasions, the representative of the Director-General was told of the importance which all attached to the procedures applied by the ILO in trade union matters and especially to the work done by the competent ILO bodies as regards the trade union problems which had arisen in the country.
.The Committee has examined the evolution of the trade union situation in Chile as well as the questions before it in Case No. , taking account of the information supplied by the representative of the Director-General which has been of great use to it in the performance of its task.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ) the Government of Chile has transmitted a further report on the evolution of the situation as regards the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association;(b) to note that the promulgation of the new legislation on trade unions, which is still being prepared, is provided for in the process of evolution of the trade union situation, but to point out to the Government that one of its priorities should be the repeal of Decree-Law No.  and the promulgation, as soon as possible, of legislation in conformity with the principles",0,1975,Chile
157,"dispute which has arisen. They include a partial list of the detainees.
.The Government states in its reply that the allegations do not accurately reflect the events. It states that a high level military commission has been instructed to inquire into the events of  June . Certain persons (both civilian and military) who are suspected of being implicated in the events have been remanded in custody and held at the disposal of the competent courts. The Government states that the temporary occupation of the offices of the National Peasants' Union and the General Confederation of Labour was decided upon in order to avoid a worse situation. These offices were returned to the organisations and the leaders, arrested as a precaution, are now free. The Government adds that it will severely punish the persons responsible, without distinction.
.The Committee has to consider particularly serious events which occurred in the Department of Olancho. It does not have at its disposal sufficient information on which to reach a decision on these events at this stage, but notes that a military commission has been instructed to carry out an inquiry and that civilian and military suspects have been remanded in custody, at the disposal of the competent courts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that the occupied trade union offices have been evacuated and the arrested leaders have been released;(b) to request the Government to provide detailed information on the results of the inquiry carried out regarding the violence in the Department of Olancho;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report as soon as it has received the information requested.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1975,Honduras
158,".The Committee last examined this case at its session in November  when it submitted an interim report (contained in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report) to the Governing Body.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCL had alleged that the Honduras army attacked the institute of the trade union federations in the Department of Olancho, killing five persons and injuring several. It had also alleged that all officers of the General Central of Workers had been arrested and that the Government was endeavouring to destroy the National Peasants' Union (a body affiliated to the WCL and the Latin American Workers' Confederation),  militant members of which were in prison. According to the complainants, , peasants marched on the capital to protest against the infringements of fundamental rights and freedom of association.
.The Latin American Federation of Peasants (FCL) claimed that the Government had massacred peasants in the Department of Olancho and that the military forces had occupied all headquarters of the National Peasants' Union and the General Central of Workers, arresting all their leaders. In other communications, the FCL stated that these events were the outcome of various problems which had been accumulating and which had remained unresolved over the years. It recalled the tragic events of  and stated that the persons responsible were the same as those who were responsible then (who maintain paramilitary organisations). The National Peasants' Union, added the complainants, had always maintained a positive attitude to these questions which remained unsolved despite numerous agreements with the Government. The FCL appended to its letters a large volume of documents relating in particular to the agrarian reforms demanded by the National Peasants' Union, to that body's meetings with the authorities and the results of the meetings, and to the dispute which had arisen. They included a partial list of the detainees.
.The Government had stated in its original reply that the allegations did not accurately reflect the events. It stated that a high-level military commission had been instructed to inquire into the events of  June . Certain persons (both civilian and military) who were suspected of being implicated in the events had been remanded in custody and held at the disposal of the competent courts. The Government also stated that the temporary occupation of the offices of the National Peasants' Union and the General Central of Workers had been decided upon in order to avoid a worse situation. These offices were returned to the organisations and the leaders, arrested as a precaution, were now free. The Government added that it would severely punish the persons responsible, without distinction.
.The Committee, taking the view that it did not have at its disposal sufficient information on which to reach a decision on these events at that stage, noted that the occupied trade union premises had been evacuated and that the arrested trade union leaders had been released. It requested the Government to provide detailed information on the results of the inquiry which was to be carried out by the military commission regarding the violence in the Department of Olancho.
.By two communications dated  January and  February , the Government transmitted additional information with regard to the complaint.
.The Government confirms that no trade unionists are being held in detention and that the persons responsible for the events which took place in the Department of Olancho are being dealt with by the competent courts.
.In addition, the Government transmits a copy of a text which it has sent to the Secretary-General of the United Nations in reply to a complaint against the Government of Honduras submitted to the Commission on Human Rights by the World Federation of Rural Workers concerning these events. From this text, the Committee notes that a commission of Inquiry was appointed by the Government to investigate the matter. When the detailed report of that Commission was issued the authorities ordered that charges be brought against those persons, whether civilian or military, who had been responsible for the above events. These persons were being held at the Central Prison and would be tried in accordance with the law. The events at Olancho, states the Government, occurred without the knowledge of the higher authorities of Honduras.
.The Government also states that the Secretary of Labour and Social Welfare has been instructed to carry out a full inquiry as to the measure of protection afforded by the law - and especially the Law on Agrarian Reform - to workers and peasants. In fact, through, the National Agrarian Institute, agreements have been reached with the peasant families concerning the lands in question which have been assigned to them legally.
.The Government appends to its communication the text of the order given to the Attorney General to take appropriate and speedy action to bring to justice the persons responsible for the events in the Department of Olancho in which a number of persons, including two women and two priests, lost their lives. The Government also appends to its communication a notice from the Director of the Central Prison in which several persons are named as being held in this connection.
.From the information at its disposal, the Committee notes that a Government inquiry into the serious events which took place in the Department of Olancho in June  has led to the arrest of a number of persons, both civilian and military, who were responsible for these events. It would also seem clear that the issues which culminated in the disturbances in Olancho related more particularly to questions of land tenure and agrarian reform. However, the Committee cannot overlook the fact that these disturbances led to the death of a number of peasants as well as to the occupation of trade union premises and the arrest of trade union leaders. The Committee notes the Government's statement that these premises have been evacuated and that the trade union leaders have all been released. In taking note of this information, the Committee would point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and that governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.In all the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the confirmation given by the Government that no trade unionists are being detained and to draw the attention of the Government to the principle expressed in the preceding paragraph regarding the arrest of trade unionists;(b) to note that the persons responsible for the events referred to by the complainants have been arrested and will be brought to trial and to request the text of the judgments pronounced in these cases; and(c) subject to the above, to decide that, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, the case does not call for further examination on its part.
.The complaints were submitted in two communications of  June , one from the World Confederation of Labour and the other from the Latin American Federation of Peasants (FCL). The FCL submitted additional information in communications of  and  July . The Government submitted its observations by communications of  and  August .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCL states that the Honduras army attacked the institute of the trade union federations in the Department of Olancho, killing five persons and injuring several. It also alleges that all officers of the General Confederation of Labour have been arrested and that the Government is endeavouring to destroy the National Peasants' Union (a body affiliated to the WCL and the Latin American Central of workers,  militant members of which are in prison. According to the complainant, , peasants marched on the capital to protest against the infringements of fundamental rights and freedom of association.
.The WCL claims that the Government has massacred peasants in the Department of Olancho and that the military forces have occupied all headquarters of the National Peasants' Union and the General Confederation of Labour, arresting all their leaders. In other communications, the WCL states that these events are the outcome of various problems which have been accumulating and which have remained unresolved over the years. It recalls the tragic events of  and states that the persons responsible are the same as were responsible then (who maintain paramilitary organisations). The National Peasants' Union, adds the complainant, has always maintained a positive attitude to these questions, which have remained unsolved despite numerous agreements with the Government. The WCL appended to its letters a large volume of documents relating in particular to the agrarian reforms demanded by the National Peasants' Union, that body's meetings with the authorities and the results of the meetings, and on the",0,1975,Honduras
159,"the Government to gain control over the trade union movement. The WFTU considers that this measure violates trade union rights.
.The Director-General transmitted these recent protests of the complainants to the Chilean Government. In its communication of  November  the Government provides the text of Legislative Decree No.  concerning the change of trade union executive Committees by election, and of Legislative Decree No.  concerning these elections.
.The Minister, in his speech of  October , had stated that free, direct and secret elections would take place in the unions in undertakings in the private sector on  October . If, in the future, a minimum membership period of two years is required for participation in elections for trade union leadership, this time all unionised workers will be able to vote in their own organisations. The new executive Committee will consist of three persons.
.The Minister continued that, in order for these elections to constitute the start of a new phase of Chilean trade unionism, conditions of eligibility have been established in order to guarantee, in particular, the ""depolitisation"" of trade union life. To this end, there will be no formal presentation of candidates in these elections. Workers will be able to vote for any member of the union who has been at least five years in the undertaking (or two years if the undertaking has existed for less than five years). Those persons who have participated in acts of a party political nature, or who have been active in a political party or who have had party political or other responsibilities or who have represented a political party cannot be elected to office. In addition, no trade union leader actually in office can be re-elected in the course of these new elections. This last rule does not mean that the authorities are unaware of the work accomplished by the present leaders, but it has become necessary to promote a new generation of trade union leaders. Every trade union leader who does not fulfil the eligibility conditions will cease to exercise his functions. All questions concerning the lack of eligibility or the cessation of functions of trade union leaders will be dealt with by the Director of Labour, with a right of appeal to the courts mentioned in the legislative decree. The elections will take place in the presence of a labour inspector whose task will be to see to it that they take place in due form. The newly-elected leaders will hold office for a period of four years. Finally, the Minister indicated - referring to the employers - that the authorities would punish severely any attempt to prevent or in any way hinder the taking place of the elections. The Government, in its report dated  October , confirms the statements made by the Minister.
.The Committee proposes to examine this question in a more detailed manner at its next session. It has, however, noted that the legislative decree on the elections contains provisions on ineligibility. It considers it appropriate to make certain preliminary comments on the matter. In principle, the lifting of the prohibition to hold trade union elections which was in force to date by virtue of Legislative Decree No.  of , could signify progress, provided that the principles of freedom of association are respected including the right of workers freely to elect their representatives. The Committee would request the Government to transmit information concerning the reasons for maintaining these cases of ineligibility.III. Measures affecting certain trade union officials and organisations(a) Removal from office and dismissal of trade union leaders.At its May  Session the Committee examined complaints relating to the removal from office or dismissal of a number of trade union officials. The first concerned three officials of a copper miners' union (Milton Puga, Director of the Occupational Union of Employees in the Copper Mines of El Teniente; Juan Fincheira, Chairman of the same union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and metallurgy Workers; Carlos Arellano, Director of the same union); two officials of the National Confederation of Bank Associations of the State of Chile, namely the President, Andrs del Campo Hamel, and the Vice-President, Arturo Moreno Patio; the President of the National Federation of Port Workers of Chile and the National Federation of Maritime Workers, Mr. Carlos Frez Rojo.
.At its May  Session the Committee examined complaints relating to the removal from office or dismissal of a number of trade union officials. The first concerned three officials of a copper miners' union (Milton Puga, Director of the Occupational Union of Employees in the Copper Mines of El Teniente; Juan Fincheira, Chairman of the same union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and metallurgy Workers; Carlos Arellano, Director of the same union); two officials of the National Confederation of Bank Associations of the State of Chile, namely the President, Andrs del Campo Hamel, and the Vice-President, Arturo Moreno Patio; the President of the National Federation of Port Workers of Chile and the National Federation of Maritime Workers, Mr. Carlos Frez Rojo.
.The three trade union leaders of the copper workers and Arturo Latuz, director of the occupational union of Caletoras had also been dismissed from their jobs. In these cases it seems that the undertaking had recourse to one of the reasons for dismissal introduced in the legislation by Legislative Decree No.  of , namely the participation in illegal acts provoking the absence of workers. The persons mentioned had been assigned to residence, and there had been a work stoppage or absenteeism on the part of certain of the workers of El Teniente (the measure of assignment to forced residence had been reported subsequently). The persons concerned had appealed to the labour court and the matter was still being dealt with. As a result of their loss of employment they had automatically lost their trade union responsibilities and had been replaced by new trade union leaders under the procedure provided for in Legislative Decree No. .
.At its May  Session the Committee recalled that national legislation which laid down that all trade union leaders must belong to the occupation in which the organisation functioned might jeopardise the exercise of trade union rights. In fact, the dismissal of a worker who was a trade union leader could, by making him forfeit his position as a trade union official, affect the freedom of action of the organisation and the right of the workers to freely elect their representatives and might even encourage acts of interference by employers. Furthermore, the Committee considered that the cases relating to trade union leaders in the banking and maritime sectors pointed to the existence of discretionary intervention on the part of the administrative authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions which was incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to intervene with a view to the reinstatement of those concerned in their trade union functions and, in the case of dismissal, in their employment, and to transmit the text of the judgement to be handed down in the cases of Juan Fincheira, Milton Puga, Carlos Arellano and Arturo Latuz.
.The Government states in its report dated  October  that the four former trade union leaders in the copper industry reached an agreement with the management of the National Copper Undertaking before the Court of Rancagua. The Government annexes a copy of their agreement to its report. The Committee will examine this information at its next session.(b) Dissolution of several trade union organisations
.Shortly before the session of the Committee, allegations were presented by several complainant organisations concerning the dissolution by the Government of certain trade union organisations. The communications sent to the ILO in this connection were transmitted to the Government, whose observations on the matter have not yet been received.
.The Committee has taken note of the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  of  October  (published in the Official Journal) concerning the dissolution of seven trade union organisations. The reasons set out in the decree indicate, in the first place, that it is the duty of the State to ensure that ""intermediate institutions"" act within the limits of their competence, and to protect citizens against activities which may lead, directly or indirectly, to the development of social strife or subversive doctrines that are contrary to the general interest. Secondly, it is stated that the conduct of those organisations mentioned in the legislative decree shows that their means of action or their objects coincide with Marxist principles or objectives. For this reason, the decree continues, these organisations have seriously and persistently distorted the nature of their functions to such a point that their existence and their functioning are incompatible with the necessity to safeguard national unity.
.Accordingly, the following are prohibited and considered as illegal organisations: the Ranquil Confederation, the United Confederation of Peasant Workers, the National Federation of Metallurgical Unions, the Occupational Union of Construction Workers of Santiago, the National",0,1975,Chile
160,"its report submitted in October , the Government had indicated that the dispute had been settled by negotiations, as a result of which various bonuses and allowances had been granted to the workers and that the workers dismissed had been reinstated. In addition, the workers who were arrested had been released.
.The Government states moreover in its communication dated  January  that there was no strike movement during this collective dispute but only a refusal to take meals in the canteens of the undertaking as a mark of protest against the delay in satisfying their claims. Some elements sought to make use of this legitimate protest to obtain political benefits, a move which the Government prevented in so far as it went beyond the occupational scope of the activities which trade unions should exercise. Furthermore, a worsening of the dispute would have affected the entire national economy. No trade union leader was involved in the activities which were extraneous to the purely occupational movement. The Government repeats that the workers dismissed for having participated in subversive activities were all reinstated. It declares that the relocation of certain workers had been of brief duration and that the place of residence assigned them was only  kilometres from Chuquicamata. Finally, the Government indicates that, in the course of the negotiations, relations were never severed between the management of the undertaking and the trade unions, and the dispute was settled a month and a half after it had begun.
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government regarding this collective labour dispute. It notes that the dispute in question did not involve a strike but only a protest action in support of claims of an occupational nature. According to the Government, the dismissals and placing under forced residence of certain workers were carried out because of the subversive activities conducted by the persons concerned on the occasion of this dispute. These measures were later rescinded.
.While noting this statement, the Committee is bound, however, to point out that the dismissals of workers occurred very shortly after the general assembly had decided to launch the protest movement. Moreover, the articles which appeared in the Chilean press concerning this affair show that trade union leaders of all tendencies called for the reinstatement of those concerned. The Committee also observes that the declaration of a state of siege in the region following the events in question resulted in major restraints being placed upon the activities of the trade union organisation, in particular as regards the right of assembly.
.The Committee notes, finally, that the dispute was settled through agreement between the parties. As a result, it considers that, while drawing the attention of the Government to the considerations expressed above, it would be pointless to go any further into this aspect of the case.(c) Trade union elections
.Several complainant organisations, including the ICFTU, the WCL and the WFTU, sent communications protesting against the method employed by the Government in organising the trade union elections on  October . Some of them state that the , trade union leaders who were in office prior to that date were unable to present their candidatures.
.In a communication dated  November , the Government supplied the text of Legislative Decree No.  concerning the change of trade union executive Committees by election, and of Legislative Decree No.  confirming these elections. The Committee had also noted a speech made by the Minister of Labour announcing the organisation of these elections shortly before the date fixed for them to be held and describing the procedure adopted as well as the conditions of eligibility established.
.At its November  Session, the Committee proposed to examine this question in a more detailed manner at its next session. It had, however, noted that the legislative decree on the elections contains provisions on ineligibility and had indicated that, in principle, the lifting of the prohibition to hold trade union elections which was in force to date by virtue of Legislative Decree No.  of , could signify progress, provided that the principles of freedom of association are respected including the right of workers freely to elect their representatives. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body had requested the Government to transmit information concerning the reasons for maintaining these cases of ineligibility.
.At its present session, the Committee examined carefully the regulations on the organisation of these elections transmitted by the Government. Legislative Decree No. , dated  October , reveals that the elections concerned basic organisations in the private sector, i.e. at the undertaking level. The scope of the legislative decree excluded organisations in the public sector as well as in the agricultural, maritime and copper sectors. This legislative decree provides, in section , that workers' trade unions will be administered by an executive Committee consisting of three persons. Section  introduces amendments to section  of the former Labour Code respecting conditions of eligibility for the functions of trade union leader. According to the article as amended, to be elected to the leadership of a trade union organisation persons must possess the following qualifications:(a) they must be at least  years of age;(b) they must be Chilean. However, foreigners married to persons of Chilean nationality and persons residing in the country for more than five years may become trade union leaders;(c) they must not have been sentenced for a crime or misdemeanour, and an action for a crime or misdemeanour must not be pending against them;(d) they must be able to read and write;(e) they must have five years' unbroken service with the undertaking (except where the undertaking has existed for less than five years);(f) they must not have engaged in party political activities, been active in a political party, had responsibilities a public representative or as a representative of a political party during the preceding ten years.Non-fulfilment of any of these eligibility conditions during a trade union leader's term of office will constitute grounds for incapacity to exercise the functions of the office. However, in its communication of  February , the Government points out that the fact of having exercised political activities will not constitute a ground for ineligibility. An incompatibility will only exist when a political office and trade union function are carried out simultaneously..In accordance with section  of the legislative decree, the Directorate of Labour is responsible for seeing that the rules laid down in section  of the Labour Code, as amended, are applied at all times. The Directorate of Labour will deal with questions arising in connection with the conditions established in paragraph (f) of this section and will settle them according to a procedure fixed by regulations. The person concerned will be able to appeal to the competent court for labour matters at the headquarters of the trade union within five days, without any possible extension. The court must call upon the Director of Labour to prepare a report which must be submitted within  days. It must hand down its judgement within the following  days.
.In accordance with section  of the legislative decree, the Directorate of Labour is responsible for seeing that the rules laid down in section  of the Labour Code, as amended, are applied at all times. The Directorate of Labour will deal with questions arising in connection with the conditions established in paragraph (f) of this section and will settle them according to a procedure fixed by regulations. The person concerned will be able to appeal to the competent court for labour matters at the headquarters of the trade union within five days, without any possible extension. The court must call upon the Director of Labour to prepare a report which must be submitted within  days. It must hand down its judgement within the following  days.
.According to section , to assume his functions as a trade union leader, the member must swear the following oath before the competent labour inspector: ""I swear that I fulfil the conditions required by the law to perform the duties of leader of a trade union organisation, that I do not and will not participate in political activities or in a political movement during the exercise of my duties, that I shall not attempt to politicise trade union organisations by distorting their objectives, that I shall not consent to be a party to such ends and that my sole objective shall be the just representation of the affiliated workers."" Two copies of the oath will be drawn up and signed jointly by the trade union leader and the labour inspector.
.The Legislative Decree also contains temporary provisions respecting the organisation of the elections on  October . All trade union members who fulfilled the conditions set forth in the Decree are candidates. Consequently, the presentation of candidatures is not authorised. Each union member has two votes and the three persons who have obtained the greatest number of votes are elected. The election must be conducted in the presence of a labour inspector or an official appointed for",0,1975,Chile
161,"this purpose. The elected leaders will hold office for a period of four years. The oath required by the Legislative Decree must be sworn within  days of the election. The leaders who are currently holding offices which are not subject to election under the Legislative Decree must swear a similar oath to that required of the new leaders. Those who do not comply with this obligation will cease to exercise their functions. Finally, persons whose term of office was prorogued or who were appointed under the terms of Legislative Decree No.  may not be appointed as trade union leaders.
.The various communications from the Government show that Legislative Decree No.  laid down temporary standards and that the final procedure for trade union elections will be defined in the new legislation. In the view of the Government, the elections carried out on  October  had the merit of being the first to be held with a truly secret ballot. The Government also points out that  per cent of the workers concerned voted. As regards the conditions of eligibility laid down by the Legislative Decree, the Government points out that these applied both to the leaders whose term of office had been prorogued by Legislative Decree No.  (and hence elected before September ) and to those appointed in accordance with the temporary standards placed on seniority. The Government also states that the elections have not produced consequences for federations and Confederations for the latter are administered by their own by-laws and these do not require leadership in a first-degree organisation so as to become a member of their controlling organ. Finally, the Government states, in its communication dated  January , that the new trade union legislation will not retain this type of exclusion.
.In his speech of  January , the Minister of Labour also indicated that all future trade union elections would be governed by permanent provisions. Moreover, these provisions will provide for the possibility for a specified number of members of a trade union which has renewed its executive Committee in accordance with Legislative Decree No.  to call for the removal from office of the leaders once only in the course of their term of office. A new election will then be held according to the terms of the final legislation on the subject.
.The Committee considers that the right of workers' organisations to elect their leaders freely constitutes an indispensable condition for them to be able in fact to act in full freedom and to promote the interests of their members effectively. For this right to be fully acknowledged it is essential that the public authorities refrain from any intervention which might interfere with the exercise of this right, whether it be in determining conditions of eligibility of leaders or in the conduct of the elections themselves.
.The Legislative Decree which governed the elections of  October  laid down conditions of eligibility, some of which raised problems of compatibility with the principles of freedom of association, in particular the provisions concerning seniority in the undertaking, the fact that candidates may not have been sentenced or have an action pending against them for a crime or misdemeanour (i.e. including offences which might not be grounds for justified disqualification for the exercise of trade union functions), and non-participation in political activities. As regards this last point, the Committee also notes that the newly elected leaders, or those remaining in office, have been required to swear an oath in order to exercise their functions and to permit themselves thereby not to engage in political activities. The Committee considers that the imposing of such an obligation on trade union leaders might involve restrictions on the freedom of action of trade union organisations incompatible with the principles of freedom of association.
.The Committee notes that, in addition to these conditions of eligibility, the Legislative Decree laid down a temporary standard ruling out the election of leaders whose term of office was extended or who had been appointed by virtue of Legislative Decree No. . In other words, in the trade unions in which elections had been held, the trade union leaders in office at the time of the elections, including those who had been elected before , could not be candidates. The Committee considers that such an exclusion was not only contrary to the principles of freedom of association, but it also deprived these organisations of experienced leaders.
.Nevertheless, the Committee notes the recent statements of the Minister of Labour according to which new elections would be held before the term of office of the leaders elected in October  expires, and that these elections will be organised on the basis of the new trade union legislation which, according to the Government will not retain this type of exclusion. In this regard the Committee notes the Government's statement that the fact of having exercised political functions will, in the future, no longer constitute a ground of ineligibility.
.The Committee notes, finally, that the number of leaders of an organisation should be limited to three persons. It considers that matters of this type should be for the trade union organisations themselves to decide.III. Measures affecting trade union officials and organisations(a) Removal from office and dismissal of trade union leaders.Complaints had been presented regarding the removal from office and dismissal of several trade union officials. Certain of these concerned four copper workers' officials (Milton Puga, Director of the Occupational Onion of Employees in the Copper Mines of El Teniente; Juan Fincheira, Chairman of the same union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and Metallurgy Workers; Carlos Arellan, Director of the same union; and Arturo Latuz, Director of the Occupational Onion of Caletones).
.Complaints had been presented regarding the removal from office and dismissal of several trade union officials. Certain of these concerned four copper workers' officials (Milton Puga, Director of the Occupational Onion of Employees in the Copper Mines of El Teniente; Juan Fincheira, Chairman of the same union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and Metallurgy Workers; Carlos Arellan, Director of the same union; and Arturo Latuz, Director of the Occupational Onion of Caletones).
.The four leaders in question had been dismissed from their jobs. In these cases it seems that the undertaking had recourse to one of the reasons for dismissal introduced in the legislation by Legislative Decree No.  of , namely the participation in illegal acts provoking the absence of workers. The persons mentioned had been assigned to residence, and there had been a work stoppage for absenteeism on the part of certain of the workers of El Teniente (the measure of assignment to forced residence had been rescinded subsequently). The persons concerned had appealed to the labour court. As a result of their loss of employment they had automatically lost their trade union responsibilities and had been replaced by new trade union leaders under the procedure provided for in Legislative Decree No. .
.The Government had stated in its report of October  that Juan Fincheira, Milton Puga, Carlos Arellano and Arturo Latuz had reached an agreement with the National Copper Undertaking before the Court of Rancaqua, by virtue of which the undertaking cancelled the dismissal of these persons. For their part, the persons concerned had given up the responsibilities they exercised within the National Copper Undertaking, El Teniente Division, as well as everything which goes with being a worker in the El Teniente Division, starting from  November . The persons concerned had in addition received various indemnities including a special and voluntary one, amounting to  months' wages and  months' in the case of Arturo Latuz (in compensation for the trade union immunity of which he could possibly avail himself).
.Since its last session, the Committee has received allegations stating that the agreement reached between the National Copper Undertaking and the leaders removed from office was not arrived at in accordance with the will and desires of the persons concerned but as a result of the pressure exercised on them and their families and the distressing economic situation in which they found themselves.
.For its part, the Government states in its communication of  January  that the parties agreed not to await the judgement of the Court of Rancagua and requested the Court to approve an agreement which would terminate all controversy. The indemnities were granted in accordance with the law and accepted freely by the parties - there can be no doubt about this since the workers benefited throughout from the advice and support of capable and freely chosen defence.
.The Committee notes that the dispute between the four leaders in question and the National Copper Undertaking was the subject of an agreement between the parties. It notes, however, that contradictory statements have been made on this point, the allegations stating that pressure was put on the leaders, while the Government stresses their free acceptance of the agreement in question. In this regard, the Committee notes that the agreement was",0,1975,Chile
162,"reached before the competent court and that the trade union leaders were able to be assisted by freely chosen defence counsel. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that it would be pointless to pursue the examination of this aspect of the case.
.The complaints also referred to the removal from office of trade union leaders in the public sector (in the National Confederation of Workers' Association in the State Bank of Chile - Messrs. Andrs del Campo Hamel and Arturo Moreno Patio - and the National Federation of Maritime Employees - Mr. Carlos Frez). In addition, new allegations refer to dismissals and removal from office of trade union leaders in the teaching (Messrs. Esteban and Ilabaca) and public works (Messrs. Jorge Ramirez and Luis Muoz) sectors.
.In its report, dated  October , the Government had stated that, as regards the leaders of the National Confederation of workers' Associations in the State Bank of Chile, the term of office of these persons, according to the rules of the organisation, was two years. Their term of office should, therefore, have ended in  and they remained in office solely by virtue of the temporary standards which prolonged the term of office of trade union leaders. Because of the extreme length of the period in which they had exercised their functions and at the request of the staff of the Bank themselves, the Government had put an end to the term of office of Andrs del Campo Hamel and Arturo Moreno Patino. The appointment of their replacements on the executive Committee of the Confederation was effected by the persons concerned themselves. The Government added that the two leaders in question continued to perform their occupational functions in the bank. Finally, the Government stated that standards would be laid down within  days to govern the organisation of bank workers.
.The WFTU and the ICFTU, for their part, referred to the promulgation of Legislative Decree No. , dated  October , in which there is a provision authorising the Minister of the Interior to dismiss any official of the public service without any guarantee or immunity.
.In its communication of  February , the Government supplies information about unionists in the maritime sector as well as the education and public works sectors about whom it is alleged that they have been removed and, in some cases, dismissed. Regarding the Chairman of the Harbour Workers' Federation, Carlos Frez, the Government points out that he was replaced by the Vice-Chairman because he had made use of the organisation for aims not related to the interests of the union and incompatible with the functions vested in him. The person concerned has been submitted to an administrative procedure conforming to the decree with force of law, No.  of , and consequently, his services in the undertaking have been terminated. There are no legal proceedings over this affair. Messrs. Esteban and Ilabaca, from the education sector have on their part been submitted to proceedings examined by the regional secretariat of the Minister for Education at Curico for infringement of the decree with force of law, No.  of . Those concerned have not presented any appeal. The Government is not aware that Mr. Esteban has been a union leader, whereas Mr. Ilabaca was until . As regards Messrs. Jorge Ramirez and Luis Muoz, members of the workers' association of public works, the Government points out that these two persons were removed by their own union in December . Subsequently they underwent an administrative procedure for absence from work. Finally, the Government points out that no official has been dismissed by virtue of Legislative Decree No. , which has been in force for over three months.
.The Committee notes the information provided regarding the removal from office tad dismissal of public sector workers' leaders. This raises the more general problem of the right to organise in the public sector. The  Labour Code provides, in section , that wage-earning and salaried employees in the service of the State or municipal authorities or belonging to State undertakings do not have the right to form a union or to belong to any union. Likewise, section  of the Administrative Regulations prohibits wage-earning and salaried employees in the service of the State from forming trade unions. Nevertheless, for many years now, public sector workers have formed various organisations of a trade union nature.
.The Committee makes a point of recalling in this regard that the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission had considered that the right to form organisations of their choice should be granted to all workers both in the private and in the public sector, including officials in the service of the State. The granting of this right to public employees means that they must enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, as was stressed by the International Labour Conference in adopting the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ).(b) Dissolution of several trade union organisations
.Allegations were presented by several complainant organisations concerning the dissolution by the Government of certain trade union organisations in October . The Committee had taken note, at its November  Session, of the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  of  October  (published in the Official Journal) concerning the dissolution of seven trade union organisations. The reasons set out in the decree indicate, in the first place, that it is the duty of the State to ensure that ""intermediate institutions"" act within the limits of their competence, and to protect citizens against activities which may lead, directly or indirectly, to the development of social strife or subversive doctrines that are contrary to the general interest. Secondly, it is stated that the conduct of those organisations mentioned in the legislative decree shows that their means of action or their objects coincide with Marxist principles or objectives. For this reason, the decree continues, these organisations have seriously and persistently distorted the nature of their functions to such a point that their existence and their functioning are incompatible with the necessity to safeguard national unity.
.Accordingly, the following are prohibited and considered as illegal organisations: the Ranquil Confederation, the United Confederation of Peasant Workers, the National Federation of Metallurgical Unions, the Occupational Union of Construction Workers of Santiago, the National Union of Textile and Clothing Workers, the Industrial Federation of Building, Wood and Construction workers and the Industrial National Federation of Mineworkers. These organisations were dissolved and their legal personality, where appropriate, removed. The legislative decree specifies moreover that the same applies to their affiliate organisations (section ). Finally, the assets of the dissolved organisations are transferred to the State (section ).
.However, in its communication of  November , the Government, referring to an official statement of the Director of Labour, pointed out that the dissolution measure had not been applied to the basic unions since the affiliated organisations had not been counted exactly. In addition, the Minister of the Interior had indicated that the current holding of their assets is only temporary and that the Government has decided that these assets are intended for the workers in the undertaking concerned and that they will have full and free use, management and possession of them.
.At its November  Session, the Committee had, in particular, pointed out that the procedure followed in this case for the dissolution of these organisations was not compatible with the principle that workers' organisations should not be dissolved by administrative authority. Accordingly, the Governing Body had, on the recommendation of the Committee requested the Government to provide, as soon as possible, its observations on this aspect of the case.
.In its communications of  January and  February , the Government states that all the organisations concerned had lodged a Constitutional appeal for protection before the Santiago Court of Appeal and that, as a result, the matter is pending in the civil courts. The Government adds that the workers have not been deprived of the right to organise and that they retain the possibility of forming and promoting organisations for the legitimate defence of their interests. Moreover, it points out that, in accordance with the law, the assets belonging to the dissolved organisations have been listed by the minister of Public Property and will be destined for the organised workers themselves if the Court denies the appeals for protection. The Government also points out that the organisations affiliated to the dissolved groups have not been touched by the dissolution measures. The Government will be mindful of the principles set out by the Committee on this question in its ""Social Plan"" to be put into concrete form in the new legislation.
.The Committee notes that the dissolved organisations have lodged an appeal and that the case is pending before the judiciary. The Committee would like to be informed about the results of these court proceedings. It considers that it would also be useful for it to be provided with information on the subsequent assignment of the assets of these dissolved organisations.IV. Civil liberties relevant to the exercise",0,1975,Chile
163,".The Committee has already examined Case No.  at its November  session, when it submitted an interim report. Since then the Government has sent a further communication dated  February . The complaints relating to Case No.  have come from the Trade Union of Carpenters, Bricklayers, Timber and Allied workers of Managua, the World Federation of Trade Unions and the General Labour Confederation of Managua (Independent). They are contained, respectively, in communications dated  September ,  February  and  January . The WFTU supplied further information on  January . The Government forwarded its observations by communications dated  December  and  March .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders(i) to note the release of the persons named by the complainants;(ii) to draw attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above concerning, firstly, the detention of trade union officials, and, secondly, the independence of the trade union movement, and, in particular,(iii) to point out to the Government that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found involves restrictions of trade union rights;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to interference by the authorities in the drawing up of trade union rules and the granting of legal personality to draw attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above, and in particular(i) to the fact that an appeal should lie to the courts against any administrative decision for refusal to register the rules of a trade union or to grant a trade union legal personality, and that,(ii) whilst it is true that the founders of a trade union must comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to hamper freedom to form organisations.",0,1975,Nicaragua
164,"of a social and economic nature are traditional forms of trade union action on the occasion of May Day. Trade unions should have the right to organise freely whatever meetings they wish to celebrate May Day, provided that they respect the arrangements made by the authorities to ensure the keeping of the peace.
.The ICFTU and the WFTU alleged in communications of May  that the Government had deprived of their nationality Messrs. Luis Meneses, General Secretary of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUT), and Humberto Elgueta and Ernesto Araneda, members of the External Committee of the CUT. As the Government had not yet furnished its observations on this matter, the Governing Body requested it in November  to forward its comments on this grave act.
.The Government stated in its communication of  January  that the persons concerned - who were living abroad - had behaved in an unpatriotic manner. They had launched a campaign among the international community designed to isolate Chile and bring down its Government. The Government added that they had levelled slanderous charges at the highest governmental and military authorities; this attitude had been manifested in communications, signed by them and containing unfounded accusations, insults and calumnies, addressed to various international bodies to encourage them to suspend loans, cancel agreements, etc. Such an attitude, continued the Government, was severely damaging to the essential interests of the State and was punishable under article () of the Chilean Constitution by loss of nationality. The Government could not do other than enforce this provision, having regard to national security, development and the country's safety, and had issued Decree No.  (published in the official Gazette on  May ), which was perfectly legal and received the assent of all the Ministers of State.
.The Government went on to state that Legislative Decree No.  of  allowed a person affected by such a measure to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court within  days of its publication. Mr. Elgueta had adopted this procedure, and the Court, by  votes to , had declared the above-mentioned decree to be null and void as far as the appellant was concerned. The Government, bowing to this decision, had issued Presidential Decree No,  of  December  (published in the Official Gazette on  December ), rescinding the measure taken against Mr. Elgueta. This proved, continued the Government, that the judicial power was entirely independent from the executive power. As for Messrs. Meneses and Araneda, the reasons which compelled the authorities to impose this severe penalty under the Constitution still subsisted.
.The Committee notes with interest that the measure taken against Mr. Elgueta has been revoked following an appeal to the Supreme Court. Bearing in mind the decision taken by this judicial body, the Government may wish to reconsider the extremely serious deprivation of rights to which Messrs. Meneses and Araneda have also been subjected.
.The WFTU and the WCL had alleged in January  that an armed group had raided the premises of the National Association of Public Employees (ANEF), and that the Vice-President of this organisation had been brutally assaulted on this occasion. The Government had stated that criminal proceedings had been initiated in this case and that the Minister of the Interior had requested the Director-General of the Investigation Service to ensure that the inquiries reached a satisfactory conclusion as speedily as possible. No further information having been received from the Government by November , the Committee expressed its regret that this was so and emphasised that a climate of violence - symptomised by acts such as this - might constitute serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and that such occurrences called for severe measures on the part of the authorities.
.In its communication of  January  the Government repeated the information summarised above. It added that the ANEF had been carrying on its activities normally at its headquarters and in the rest of the country, its leaders travelling continually within the country as well as going abroad to participate in events of all kinds.
.The Committee notes this last information.
.Within a more general context, the Committee has been informed that consultations are taking place between the Director-General and the Government of Chile with a view to having recourse to the direct contacts procedure in the near future.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists:(i) to express its regret that the Government has supplied no further information with respect to the many persons named by the complainants as having been arrested or disappeared, and to urge the Government to supply particulars of the inquiries made into the situation of the persons named in the list annexed to the present case;(ii) to note that the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn has not been continued despite the recommendations of the Committee and the Governing Body, which were formulated on the basis of new facts which had arisen, and to deplore the fact that it is therefore impossible for the Committee to form an opinion in full knowledge of the facts on a matter of such seriousness;(iii) to note that, according to the Government, Messrs. Samuel Astorga, Eduardo Berrios and Ramn Velasquez were not arrested, to bring this reply to the attention of the complainants, and to request the Government to forward its observations concerning the arrest of Juan Montecinos;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the assignment of trade unionists to forced residence:(i) to note with interest the release of seven trade union officials assigned to forced residence in November ;(ii) to note, however, that the Government has not specified the offences of which they were accused, and to draw its attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraph  with respect to guarantees of due process of law;(iii) to request the Government to indicate the precise reasons for which measures of assignment were taken against the persons mentioned in paragraph  above;(c) with regard to the allegations concerning the bringing of pressure to bear on trade union leaders and the refusal to allow certain trade union organisations to celebrate May Day, to draw the Government's attention to the principles set forth in paragraph , and to emphasise in particular that the holding of peaceful meetings and the voicing of demands of a social and economic nature are traditional forms of trade union action on the occasion of May Day;(d) with regard to the allegations concerning the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from trade union officials in exile, to note with interest the rescinding of the measure taken against one of these officials following an appeal to the Supreme Court, and to suggest to the Government, bearing in mind the decision taken by this judicial body, the possibility of reconsidering with respect to the other two persons named by the complainants the extremely serious deprivation of rights to which they have been subjected;(e) to note that consultations are taking place with a view to having recourse to the direct contacts procedure in the near future;(f) to take note of this interim report.
.In pursuance of the resolution concerning human and trade union rights in Chile adopted by the international Labour Conference at its th Session (June ), and following requests from the Governing Body, the Government submitted four reports under article  of the ILO Constitution on the measures taken to comply with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, whose final report had been accepted by the Government. The first of these reports was examined by the Governing Body during its th Session (November ). The others were the subject of reports by the Committee which were respectively approved by the Governing Body at its th, st and rd Sessions (May , November  and May ).
.In paragraph  of its st Report, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, and to submit a report on this subject by  October . The Government submitted this report in a communication dated  September .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the decision taken by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May ), the Government of Chile has submitted a further report on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on freedom of Association;(b) to express once more its deep concern at the slowness in adapting new trade union legislation and to urge the Government to repeal Legislative Decree No. , and to promulgate without",0,1975,Chile
165,"delay legislation guaranteeing the free exercise of trade union rights;(c) to request the Government to provide information on the functioning of tripartite Committees and to state what measures are being taken or envisaged to ensure greater freedom in collective bargaining; and to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraph  above;(d) to request the Government to furnish the information requested in paragraphs ,  and  concerning, respectively, the Ranquil Confederation and the United Confederation of Workers and Peasants, the FENATEX and the FIEMC, and the ANESE;(e) to note with interest the Government's communication to the effect that the persons placed at the disposal of the executive authorities, and as such detained under the powers conferred under the state of siege provisions, have now been released;(f) to note also that the allegations relating to the arrest or disappearance of certain serving or former trade union officials are being examined within the context of Case No. ;(g) to request the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission, and to submit a report on this subject by  April .
.The Committee has already examined this case in February, May and November  and in February and May . It submitted an interim report at each of these sessions.
.Just before the May  Session, and since that session, the office received a number of communications from the following complaining organisations bearing the dates indicated hereafter: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May ); World Federation of Trade Unions ( May,  June,  July and  September ); Trade Unions International of chemical, oil and Allied Workers ( July ). These communications were transmitted to the Government for its observations. The Government supplied information in a communication dated  September .
.The allegations at issue concern the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists and pressure exerted upon trade union officials, the raiding of trade union premises, the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from trade union leaders in exile and refusal to allow certain trade union organisations to celebrate May Day.
.The complainants had communicated the names of numerous serving or former trade union officials who had been arrested or who had disappeared. The Government had supplied information concerning several of the persons named by the complainants. It had also stated on several occasions that nobody was or had been under arrest on account of his status as a trade unionist or his trade union activities, but for breaches of the law or for reasons of public order.
.At its May  Session, the Committee recommended the Governing Body:(i) to note that some of the persons mentioned by the complainants as having disappeared were at liberty in the country; others, however, had left the country;(ii) to remind the Government that it had not yet transmitted information on a large number of persons;(iii) to urge the Government to continue its investigations into the disappearance of the trade unionists in respect of whom it stated that it had no information, and to request it to communicate the findings, and to request the Government to supply information on the situation of the persons listed in the annex to the present case;(iv) to request the Government to allow the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn to be pursued with the greatest care and objectivity, and to communicate the findings of the inquiry.
.In a telegram dated  May , the WFTU referred to a communication from the External Committee of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUT) alleging the arrest by the National Intelligence Department (DINA), in March , of Juan Eduardo Berros Morales, an official of the Chilean Confederation of Employees in the Private Sector (CEPCH). This trade union official was said to have been arrested at his home at dawn. He was beaten up and taken, blindfold, to a building where he remained for about  hours, being tortured and interrogated. He was subsequently freed at a spot near his home, to which he was authorised to go after being threatened that he and his family would be killed if he revealed what had happened to him. A case had been filed in this respect with the Santiago courts under the amparo procedure.
.In its communication of  June , the WFTU referred to the interrogation by the DINA on  June  of two trade union officials, Samuel Astorga and Ramn Velasquez, at Pudahuel Airport on their return from Caracas, where they had attended a trade union meeting. In a later communication from the WFTU it was stated that the persons who had carried out the interrogation identified themselves as security agents. The documents these trade union officials had with them were seized.
.The WFTU appended to its communication of  July  a document explaining the different forms of arrests made in Chile. In some cases the period in custody is very short. The persons concerned are arrested at their homes or in the streets and taken to interrogation centres, where they are tortured. They are freed after a few hours or a few days. They are enjoined not to reveal what has happened to the judicial authorities or to the Church. In some cases, the persons in question are forced to continue to collaborate with the security services. Other arrests are followed by disappearance. Lastly, some persons, a few days after their arrest by the security services, are placed at the disposal of the competent military or ordinary court, whereupon they are transferred to a public prison.
.The document sent by the WFTU also stated that a number of trade union officials had been molested as part of an attempt to create a general climate of fear among the workers' representatives. These incidents were said to be connected with the activities of these officials on the occasion of May Day. The trade union leaders who had signed a document entitled ""Analysis and aspirations of the Chilean workers after  months of military government"", which was submitted to the Government on May Day, stated in a communication addressed to the Archbishop of Santiago that subsequently ""overt, illegal and abusive pressure"" had been brought to bear on the trade union leaders who had associated themselves with this document.
.The communication from the WFTU went on to refer to a number of amparo submissions filed by trade union leaders as a result of acts directed against them personally. The persons concerned: Hector Hugo Cuevas Salvador, President of the Industrial Federation of Building, Woodworking and Building Materials Workers; Fernando Bobadilla Pisani, President of the National Textile and Clothing Workers' Federation; Ricardo Celedonio Lecaros Gonzlez, President of the National Federation of Iron and Steel and Metalworking Industrial Unions; Sergio de Jess Villalobos, President of the Ranquil Confederation. All these leaders, whose organisations had all been signatories to the document submitted to the Government on May Day, were subsequently followed by vehicles and persons in civilian clothes. The premises of their organisations or their homes were kept under surveillance, and some of them received a series of anonymous telephone calls.
.In its communication of  July , the Trade Unions International of Chemical, Oil and Allied Workers alleged that Carlos Contreras Maluje, a member of the single National Union of Chemical and Pharmaceutical Laboratory Workers, was arrested in October  by the DINA. He was injured at the time of his arrest, and since then nothing more had been heard of him.
.The WFTU's communication of  September  contained additional information about serving and former trade union officials whose arrest or disappearance had been mentioned in earlier complaints. This complaint also contained new allegations concerning the arrest or disappearance between  and  of  serving or former trade union officials who were not named in earlier complaints. This information and these allegations were communicated to the Government for its observations. Appended to this communication was a list of  other persons who did not have the status of trade union officials but who, according to the complainants, were arrested and then disappeared because they were members of a trade union, and had engaged in legitimate trade union activities before or after the change of regime. The dates of these arrests were spread over the period from September  to August . The Committee requests the complainants to supply particulars as to the trade union membership and activities of the persons in question.
.In its communication of  September , the Government supplied some information about persons named in the annexes to the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission's report in respect of whom the Committee had requested information as to their present circumstances. The persons whose names follow are at liberty after serving sentences of imprisonment or forced residence: Jaime Aros Cruz, Alfonso Carreo Diaz, Juan Elpidio Gonzlez, Edgardo Lobos Flores, Guillermo Mardones Campos, Rolando Oato Zambrano, Isabel Peiford, Osvaldo Tello Gomez. Another person, Hernn Venegas Cutio, is serving a prison",0,1975,Chile
166,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",-1,1975,Dominican Republic
167,"been dismissed from his job at the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning (where he was also general secretary of the union) and subsequently, on the grounds of a strike called by the workers of the institute, had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga and detained under the same conditions. These two persons were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common law offenders.
.The Government replied that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. For this reason, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic had charged him before the municipal court of Tibs with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. The trial had not yet been completed.
.As regards the case of Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, continued the Government, he had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga, for which he was also being prosecuted before the municipal court of Tibs.
.The Committee took note of this information. It nevertheless noted that the facts impugned go back to July  and that the trade unionists concerned have not yet been brought to trial. Moreover, it was not possible to determine with any certainty whether the persons concerned were still detained. The Committee recalled the importance it attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political nature or under common law, which the Government considers to have no bearing on their trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried rapidly by an impartial and independent judicial authority. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had drawn the Government's attention to this principle and requested it to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the two cases.
.In its letter of  April  the Government states that proceedings have been instituted against the two abovementioned trade unionists before the Higher Court of San Jos, which has ordered them to be released on , colons bail each
.It would appear from available information that proceedings have been instituted against two trade union officials for strikes in public services. They have nevertheless been released on bail. The Committee has stressed on a number of occasions that recognition of the right of public employees to organise does not imply the right to strike.
.Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, the Committee has pointed out in a number of cases concerning Costa Rica that, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented. In the present case, section  of the Labour code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for settlement.
.Nevertheless, in one of the above-mentioned cases relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special act setting up the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. The Committee therefore feels it to be necessary, in the present case, for the Government to specify whether section  was applicable to the collective labour disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.The National Union of Social Security Employees alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected.
.The Government had supplied no comments in this connection. In November  the Committee recalled that freedom of assembly and election by trade union organisations, without interference by employers and the public authorities, constitutes an essential guarantee of the free exercise of trade union rights. Furthermore, Article  of Convention no.  stipulates that workers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by employers (either directly, or by their agents or members) in their establishment, functioning or administration. In particular, acts which are designed to support workers' organisations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, are deemed to constitute acts of interference. The Governing Body had requested the Government to communicate its observations on this aspect of the case.
.The Government has still not supplied comments in this connection.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not yet seen fit to reply to these allegations, which refer to incidents that took place three years ago. In an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention, and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that the occupational organisations were provided by the national legislation with the means to enforce the rights guaranteed to them under the said provisions.) The Committee subsequently noted that Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to protect workers' organisations from acts of interference by employers and their organisations. According to section  of the Labour Code ""any case not provided for by this Code, the regulations hereunder or acts supplementary or related thereto shall be decided in accordance with the general principles of labour law, equity and local custom and usage; in default thereof the provisions laid down in the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Organisation shall be applied in the first place, in so far as they are not contrary to the laws of the country, and thereafter the principles and enactments of ordinary law"". The Committee had also pointed out that Convention No. , by virtue of its ratification by Costa Rica, had been incorporated in the national legislation, and accordingly considered that it would be most appropriate for the Government to examine the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions ensuring the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers and their organisations.
.The Committee considers that these conclusions are also applicable in the present case. It would appear from an observation made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in  that a draft law concerning collective labour relations containing provisions giving protection to workers' organisations against acts of interference has been submitted to the legislative assembly but has not yet been adopted.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the dismissal of two trade union officials, to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro in his employment, and also to request it to transmit the text of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor;(b) as regards the arrest of two other trade union officials:(i) to recall the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  and  regarding strikes in public services;(ii) to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code is applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Town Planning;(iii) to note that Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes have been released on bail, and to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in their cases, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) as regards the interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly, to urge the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaints of the National Union of Social Security Employees, the General Confederation of workers and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica are contained in communications dated  June ,  August ",-1,1975,Costa Rica
168,"as it is pronounced.
.The Committee takes note of this information. However, it feels bound to draw attention once again to the considerable time that elapsed between the dismissal of Sobrado Chaves on  February  and the institution of legal proceedings. It wishes to repeat that a particularly rapid procedure should be applied for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. Any worker who is dependent on his employment will inevitably have difficulty in waiting for a long time once he has been deprived of his job because of what appears to him to be antiunion discrimination. Some countries have tackled this problem by means of emergency summary procedures; in the view of the Committee, adoption of such procedures on a temporary or permanent basis would undoubtedly help to improve the system of protection against forms of anti-union discrimination, especially dismissals.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government once again to secure the adoption without delay of the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers;(b) to take note of the information communicated by the Government concerning the existence of a compulsory arbitration procedure where strikes are prohibited, as in the case of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and to request it to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to draw the Government's attention, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, to request it to communicate, as soon as it is pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in respect of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor, and to note further the information provided by the Government on Acua Castro;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November , when it submitted the interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (November ).
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding refer to the dismissal or arrest of trade union officials and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly. The Government sent further information by a letter of  April .
.According to the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), Mr. Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary UNDECA, had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State (Contralora general de la Repblica) on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Mr. Acua Castro in the elections.
.The General Confederation of Workers (CGT) and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO) referred to the situation of Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of UNEBANCO. It was alleged that Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the bank. Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Carl Os Manuel Acua Castro, the Government referred to a circular issued by the office of the Chairman of the Social Security Fund. It affirmed that the versions given of the case were untrue and that the measure in question constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. The Government stated that on  January  the court of first instance, the San Jos labour court, judged that the suit filed by Mr. Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  April  the court of second instance, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos, upheld this judgement. Finally, the Social Security Fund had filed an appeal before the Supreme Court for the quashing of the sentence. The Supreme Court had not yet given judgement.
.The Government further indicated that on  August  the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for, authorisation to dismiss Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves. The bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. The courts considered that the dismissal was unjustified. On  February , Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the judicial authorities as the judges had expressed the view that the grounds for dismissal were controversial and might be diversely construed.
.In November , the Committee noted that these two cases had been brought before the competent courts, where they were still pending. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had requested the Government to supply the text of any judgements rendered.
.The Government attaches to its communication of  April  the judgement rendered by the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund. This decision, dated  August , confirms those of the lower jurisdictions. It states that the judges consider that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro were unjustified and orders the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless consider that Mr. Acua Castro did not prove that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.In addition, states the Government, proceedings have been instituted before the San Jos labour court against the Bank of Costa Rica in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves. The proceedings, which began on  April , are not yet completed.
.The Committee notes the decision of the Supreme Court concerning the first of the persons cited by the complainants. In this connection, the Committee has pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of an act of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts judged that Mr. Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees, had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Committee considers it desirable that the Government should re-examine this case and envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro.
.In addition, the Committee feels obliged to point out that, although the aforementioned order of the Supreme Court is dated  August , the Government made no mention of it in its earlier communications (dated  May ). The Committee can only regret that this was not done, and trusts that the Government will communicate a copy of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves as soon as this has been rendered. In the latter connection, the Committee notes that Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed over a year ago and that the legal proceedings are not yet completed. It wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities
.The CGT also alleged that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, had first been removed from his job and subsequently, owing to a strike which had been called by the general assembly of the union for  to  July , had been charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. He was imprisoned and was refused bail.
.In addition, stated the complainants, Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP), had",0,1975,Costa Rica
169,"Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and of Mario Devanda Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP) and of the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. According to the complainants, both had first been dismissed from their jobs; subsequently, because of the strike called by the workers of the establishments in which they had been employed, they were charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. Both were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common criminals.
.The Government had replied that Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The Public Prosecutor had brought charges against him of riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Mario Devanda Brenes had been charged with the same offences. The Government stated that these two persons were to be brought to trial before the Higher Court of San Jose, which had ordered them to be released on bail of , colons each.
.Proceedings had therefore been instituted against the two trade unionists for strikes in public services. The Committee recalled, in this connection, that recognition of the right of public employees to organise did not imply the right to strike. Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented.
.In the present case, section  of the Labour Code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for compulsory settlement. Nevertheless, in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special law setting up the Costa Rican Electricity institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. In June , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code was applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. The Governing Body had also requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of the principles and considerations outlined above and specifies that section  of the Labour code is fully applicable to the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, pursuant to section , paragraphs (a) and (d), of the Code:For the purposes of the last preceding section () the following shall be deemed to be public services:(a) all work performed by persons in the employment of the State or a state institution, if the work in question is not of the same nature as work performed also by private undertakings carried on for profit;(d) work performed by employees who are strictly indispensable for the maintenance in operation of private undertakings which cannot suspend their services without causing serious and immediate prejudice to public health or public economy in general, such as clinics and hospitals, and municipal hygiene, cleaning and lighting services;The Government adds that the trial of Alfaro Ziga and Devanda Brenes is still before the Higher Penal Court, following an appeal by the defence.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.Finally, the Committee had received allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union officials. According to the Complainants, Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Acua Castro in the elections. It was further alleged that Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO), had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the Bank. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.The Government affirmed that, according to the Social Security Fund, Acua Castro's dismissal constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. Nevertheless, the Labour Court and, subsequently, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos had judged that the suit filed by Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  August , the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court had confirmed this decision. It stated that the judges considered that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Acua Castro were unjustified and ordered the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless considered that Acua Castro had not proved that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.The Government further stated that, on  August , the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for authorisation to dismiss Cristin Sobrado Chaves. The Bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. On  February , Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The Bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the labour judge of San Jos but that the proceedings, which began on  April , were not yet completed.
.The Committee noted the decision of the Supreme Court concerning Acua Castro. In this connection, it pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts had judged that the trade union official had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to envisage the possibility of reinstating Acua Castro in his employment. The Committee further noted that Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed a long time ago and that the legal proceedings were not yet completed. It recalled the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, and the Governing Body had requested the Government to transmit, as soon as it was pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in the case of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that Acua Castro held for several months the post of chief of the technical co-operation and international affairs unit of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which he had left of his own free will to take up a post in the private sector. As regards Sobrado Chaves, adds the Government, this case is still before the Labour Court but the judgement is expected to be handed down very soon and will be communicated to the ILO as soon",-1,1975,Costa Rica
170,"and incitement to a collective stoppage of public services. According to the indictment put before the criminal court, on the occasion of a strike at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute in July of that year, these persons, who had no connection with the Institute (Mr. Alfaro Ziga having been dismissed from it a few months earlier, as stated above), insinuated themselves into the movement and by haranguing them and making subversive speeches incited some  workers to take part in a collective cessation of their public duties; they succeeded in persuading them to stop work, thus paralysing the main electricity supply plant. Also according to the indictment, the strike had been declared unlawful that very same day by the labour court - a ruling not found acceptable by the strikers, who insulted and stoned the Civil Guardsmen who arrived two days later to enforce the court order.
.The Government furnishes a judicial attestation to the effect that in May , when Mr. Devandas Brenes was elected to be a member of the Legislative Assembly, the examining magistrate eliminated him from the proceedings, which he continued with respect to the other accused. The Government considers that it has demonstrated that these persons participated in an unlawful strike staged in an institution for which they did not work and not ""in strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions"" it further states that neither the dismissals nor the measures taken to preserve law and order constituted breaches of the ILO Conventions on freedom of association.
.With regard to Mr. Sobrado Chaves, who, as stated above, was General Secretary of the Onion of Bank Employees of Costa Rica at the time of his dismissal, the Government also supplies the text of the judgement pronounced by the labour judge and confirmed on appeal, rejecting his claim against the bank. These judgements state that in connection with a collective dispute, Mr. Sobrado Chaves was appointed by the employees of the bank to be one of their representatives at a conciliation tribunal. The bank authorities considered that he was subsequently guilty of unjustified absences and requested authorisation from the courts to dismiss him, which was refused so long as the collective dispute was still pending. The bank dismissed him as soon as the dispute was settled in the judgement it is declared proven that this person absented himself from work  times over a period of two months without having given due notice. The court states that employers may not refuse time off to employees appointed to represent the workers at conciliation proceedings, but that this right of an employee is not unrestricted, but is limited to the time required to attend such proceedings and does not extend to other activities unconnected with the conciliation tribunal. In the case in question, according to the judgement, the repeated absences did not coincide with any of the hearings of the conciliation tribunal.
.The Committee observes that the Government has now supplied detailed information about these events, which occurred some time ago. It considers nevertheless that the texts of the judgements in question have been useful in helping it to reach its conclusions.
.The Committee and the Governing Body have constantly emphasised the importance of the principle that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. In this very case, the Committee has pointed out that such a guarantee is also necessary in the case of trade union officials in order to give effect to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations must have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee has nevertheless stated that this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances. In certain cases the Committee has expressed the view that dismissal for absence from work without the employer's permission does not appear in itself to constitute an infringement of freedom of association.
.As concerns the dismissal of three general secretaries of organisations of workers in the public sector, the Committee observes that they took place in different circumstances and for different reasons, two of the persons concerned being accused of failing in their duty as employees to an extent considered by the country's courts to be sufficiently serious to justify their dis-missal in the other case, the official concerned was one of a group of workers who lost their jobs as a result of a forced reduction in staff.
.In these circumstances, the Committee notes that in the cases to which the complaints refer it has not been proved that there was any infringement of freedom of association. Nevertheless, whatever the grounds for these dismissals may have been, it appears desirable to draw attention to the inevitably prejudicial effects upon trade union organisations and their members, and upon industrial relations, deriving from situations of this kind. The Committee wishes to point out that in the public sector an effective means of helping to prevent such situations may be to put into practice measures inspired by the principles of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not only as concerns the protection of public employees against anti-union discrimination (Article  of the Convention) but also as regards the determination, through negotiation or other methods as provided for in the Convention, of the nature and scope of the facilities to be afforded, without prejudice to the efficient operation of the service concerned, to the representatives of recognised public employees' organisations (Articles  and ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as concerns the question of the protection of workers' organisations against possible acts of interference by employers, to draw the Government's attention once again, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, to the desirability of adopting special legislative measures in order to give full effect to this principle;(b) with regard to the dismissal of trade union officials in the public sector:(i) to take note of the fact that the Government has supplied the texts of the judgements pronounced in these cases, from which it appears that in the cases in question there has been no infringement of freedom of association;(ii) nevertheless, with a view to preventing possible acts of anti-union discrimination and the harmful consequences deriving from the dismissal of trade union officials, to draw attention to the importance of putting into practice the measures indicated in paragraph  above;(c) to bring this report to the notice of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, respectively. The Governing Body approved the first of these reports at its th Session (November ) and the second at its th Session (June ). The Government sent further information in a letter dated  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined these cases, the Committee's conclusions related to the dismissal and arrest of trade union leaders and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly.
.With regard to the latter point, the complainants had alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected. The Government had made no observations on this point and the Committee had expressed its regret that the Government had not done so.
.Referring to the conclusions it had reached in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that workers' organisations, in particular, were provided by the national legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their associations. Although Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect, a draft law concerning collective labour relations did contain them; the draft law had been submitted to the legislative assembly but had not yet been adopted.
.On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, in June , urged the Government to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations. In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of these observations.
.The allegations outstanding also refer to the arrest of Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of",-1,1975,Costa Rica
171,".The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May and November ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, which are to be found in its nd Report (paragraphs  to ), st Report (paragraphs  to ) and th Report (paragraphs  to ). The Governing Body approved these reports in November  and in June and November  (th, th and th Sessions), respectively. The Government handed over various documents with a bearing on the case at an interview on  June  between the Minister of Labour and the Chairman of the Committee, and supplied further information in a communication dated  July .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its sessions in June and November , the Committee made certain comments in relation to the question of principle raised by the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the affairs of its employees' union. In September  the Government sent information with respect to one aspect of the question, namely the reasons for the dismissal of a trade union official.
.Recalling its conclusions in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that ratification of Convention No.  involved an undertaking, under the terms of Article  of that Convention, to ensure that workers' organisations in particular were provided by the legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their organisations. Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in June , the Governing Body urged the Government to adopt the necessary provisions without delay in a communication dated  September , the Government stated that it had taken note of these recommendations, which the Governing Body reiterated in November  when it approved paragraph  of the Committee's th Report.
.In its further observations of  July  the Government states that the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the union UNDECA never took place. Among the documents supplied is an attestation by the authorities of the Fund to the effect that an examination of the accounts for the period to which the complaint refers ( and ) shows that the Fund did not pay the travelling expenses of workers as an inducement to attend a certain trade union meeting, as has been claimed by the complainants. The Government also draws attention to the information furnished earlier to the effect that a judgement pronounced in August  had declared it not proven that Mr. Carlos Acua Castro, an official of the union, had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities. The Government supplies the text of this judgement. In addition, in letters sent to the ILO by Mr. Acuo Castro - now a Ministry of Labour official - and a number of the UNDECA officials who had signed the complaint, it is acknowledged that the facts were not as serious as was claimed in the first place.
.The Committee notes this information. It nevertheless considers that its general conclusions as to the need for legislative provisions which will protect workers' organisations against possible interference by employers are still applicable. In effect, to give the necessary publicity to provisions such as those of Article  of the Convention and ensure that full effect is given to them in practice, even in cases where ratification has the effect of incorporating the international standard in municipal law, it is highly important that these provisions, accompanied by provision for appeals and penalties to ensure that they are complied with, should be embodied explicitly in the relevant legislation. The Committee is therefore of the opinion that the recommendations already approved by the Governing Body in this respect should be maintained.
.The other matters still outstanding concern the dismissal from their jobs of three other officials of unions of employees in the public sector and the criminal proceedings brought by the authorities against two of them. These events occurred in  and . According to the allegations, Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service workers, were dismissed from their jobs. Subsequently, according to the complainants, because of strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions, they were charged with incitement to strike and other offences and imprisoned. The Government stated that Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during a strike in July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and that the Public Prosecutor had charged both him and Devandas Brenes with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of public services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Both were to be brought to trial and the court had allowed them to be released on bail.
.Bearing in mind the principles it had upheld in this connection, the Committee examined the provisions of the Labour Code which prohibit strikes in the public services and make it compulsory for any disputes between employers and workers in this sector to be referred to the labour courts. The Committee pointed out in particular that where strikes were prohibited or restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interest of the workers to the full, including in particular the existence of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties could take part at every stage and in which the awards were binding in all cases on both parties and must be fully and promptly implemented. In this connection the Government confirmed that the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed in the Labour Code was applicable to disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in November  the Governing Body requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.The remaining dismissal involved Mr. Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica. He had been dismissed in February , according to the complainants, on the false pretext of unjustified absences from work. The Government stated inter alia that legal proceedings were pending in connection with this matter. In November  the Committee and the Governing Body drew attention to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. The Government was requested to supply the text of the judgement handed down in the case relating to the dismissal of Mr. Sobrado Chaves.
.The documents and observations communicated by the Government on  June and  July  include the texts of the judgements requested. As concerns Mr. Devandas Brenes, it is stated in the judgements pronounced by the labour court and the Higher Labour Court in September and October  that he was discharged on  March  by the institute of Housing and Town Planning together with other workers, as part of a retrenchment of staff rendered necessary by financial difficulties. The judges considered it proven that Mr. Devandas Brenes had been dismissed for this reason and not arbitrarily or as a means of anti-union persecution, and that the employer had obtained authorisation in advance from an advisory board as required by the collective agreement. As regards Mr. Alfaro Ziga, the judgements, likewise of first and second instance, pronounced in March and May  state that he was dismissed in February  by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The union had filed a complaint with the Legislative Assembly against the authorities of the Institute, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. The Assembly set up a commission of inquiry. Later the union executive had a statement published in the press accusing the authorities of the institute of anti-union persecution. The latter enjoined Mr. Alfaro Ziga to substantiate some of the charges made, which he did not do himself, but left it to the union, whereupon he was dismissed. The court considered that the dismissal was justified, observing, inter alia, that while the union was a separate legal entity from its members, this fact did not exonerate Mr. Alfaro Ziga from his responsibilities as an employee in his relations with his employer. According to the court, the statement published by the union was based on charges made personally by this employee, who did not substantiate them as instructed by his employer, and was thus guilty of dishonesty and disloyalty. The court considered that there was just cause for dismissal on the ground of serious non-compliance with the obligations deriving from a contract of employment as specified in the Labour Code.
.The Government also supplies information concerning the criminal proceedings initiated in  against Messrs. Devandas Brenes and Alfaro Ziga on charges of riot",1,1975,Costa Rica
172,"and incitement to a collective stoppage of public services. According to the indictment put before the criminal court, on the occasion of a strike at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute in July of that year, these persons, who had no connection with the Institute (Mr. Alfaro Ziga having been dismissed from it a few months earlier, as stated above), insinuated themselves into the movement and by haranguing them and making subversive speeches incited some  workers to take part in a collective cessation of their public duties; they succeeded in persuading them to stop work, thus paralysing the main electricity supply plant.

The Governing Body approved the first of these reports at its th Session (November ) and the second at its th Session (June ). The Government sent further information in a letter dated  September .

.On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, in June , urged the Government to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations. In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of these observations.
.The allegations outstanding also refer to the arrest of Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of",-1,1975,Costa Rica
173,"Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and of Mario Devanda Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP) and of the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. According to the complainants, both had first been dismissed from their jobs; subsequently, because of the strike called by the workers of the establishments in which they had been employed, they were charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. Both were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common criminals.
.The Government had replied that Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The Public Prosecutor had brought charges against him of riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Mario Devanda Brenes had been charged with the same offences. The Government stated that these two persons were to be brought to trial before the Higher Court of San Jose, which had ordered them to be released on bail of , colons each.
.Proceedings had therefore been instituted against the two trade unionists for strikes in public services. The Committee recalled, in this connection, that recognition of the right of public employees to organise did not imply the right to strike. Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented.
.In the present case, section  of the Labour Code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for compulsory settlement. Nevertheless, in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special law setting up the Costa Rican Electricity institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. In June , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code was applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. The Governing Body had also requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of the principles and considerations outlined above and specifies that section  of the Labour code is fully applicable to the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, pursuant to section , paragraphs (a) and (d), of the Code:For the purposes of the last preceding section () the following shall be deemed to be public services:(a) all work performed by persons in the employment of the State or a state institution, if the work in question is not of the same nature as work performed also by private undertakings carried on for profit;(d) work performed by employees who are strictly indispensable for the maintenance in operation of private undertakings which cannot suspend their services without causing serious and immediate prejudice to public health or public economy in general, such as clinics and hospitals, and municipal hygiene, cleaning and lighting services;The Government adds that the trial of Alfaro Ziga and Devanda Brenes is still before the Higher Penal Court, following an appeal by the defence.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.Finally, the Committee had received allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union officials. According to the Complainants, Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Acua Castro in the elections. It was further alleged that Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO), had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the Bank. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.The Government affirmed that, according to the Social Security Fund, Acua Castro's dismissal constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. Nevertheless, the Labour Court and, subsequently, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos had judged that the suit filed by Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  August , the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court had confirmed this decision. It stated that the judges considered that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Acua Castro were unjustified and ordered the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless considered that Acua Castro had not proved that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.The Government further stated that, on  August , the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for authorisation to dismiss Cristin Sobrado Chaves. The Bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. On  February , Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The Bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the labour judge of San Jos but that the proceedings, which began on  April , were not yet completed.
.The Committee noted the decision of the Supreme Court concerning Acua Castro. In this connection, it pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts had judged that the trade union official had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to envisage the possibility of reinstating Acua Castro in his employment. The Committee further noted that Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed a long time ago and that the legal proceedings were not yet completed. It recalled the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, and the Governing Body had requested the Government to transmit, as soon as it was pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in the case of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that Acua Castro held for several months the post of chief of the technical co-operation and international affairs unit of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which he had left of his own free will to take up a post in the private sector. As regards Sobrado Chaves, adds the Government, this case is still before the Labour Court but the judgement is expected to be handed down very soon and will be communicated to the ILO as soon",-1,1975,Costa Rica
174,"as it is pronounced.
.The Committee takes note of this information. However, it feels bound to draw attention once again to the considerable time that elapsed between the dismissal of Sobrado Chaves on  February  and the institution of legal proceedings. It wishes to repeat that a particularly rapid procedure should be applied for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. Any worker who is dependent on his employment will inevitably have difficulty in waiting for a long time once he has been deprived of his job because of what appears to him to be antiunion discrimination. Some countries have tackled this problem by means of emergency summary procedures; in the view of the Committee, adoption of such procedures on a temporary or permanent basis would undoubtedly help to improve the system of protection against forms of anti-union discrimination, especially dismissals.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government once again to secure the adoption without delay of the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers;(b) to take note of the information communicated by the Government concerning the existence of a compulsory arbitration procedure where strikes are prohibited, as in the case of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and to request it to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to draw the Government's attention, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, to request it to communicate, as soon as it is pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in respect of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor, and to note further the information provided by the Government on Acua Castro;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November , when it submitted the interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (November ).
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding refer to the dismissal or arrest of trade union officials and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly. The Government sent further information by a letter of  April .
.According to the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), Mr. Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary UNDECA, had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State (Contralora general de la Repblica) on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Mr. Acua Castro in the elections.
.The General Confederation of Workers (CGT) and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO) referred to the situation of Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of UNEBANCO. It was alleged that Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the bank. Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Carl Os Manuel Acua Castro, the Government referred to a circular issued by the office of the Chairman of the Social Security Fund. It affirmed that the versions given of the case were untrue and that the measure in question constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. The Government stated that on  January  the court of first instance, the San Jos labour court, judged that the suit filed by Mr. Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  April  the court of second instance, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos, upheld this judgement. Finally, the Social Security Fund had filed an appeal before the Supreme Court for the quashing of the sentence. The Supreme Court had not yet given judgement.
.The Government further indicated that on  August  the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for, authorisation to dismiss Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves. The bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. The courts considered that the dismissal was unjustified. On  February , Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the judicial authorities as the judges had expressed the view that the grounds for dismissal were controversial and might be diversely construed.
.In November , the Committee noted that these two cases had been brought before the competent courts, where they were still pending. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had requested the Government to supply the text of any judgements rendered.
.The Government attaches to its communication of  April  the judgement rendered by the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund. This decision, dated  August , confirms those of the lower jurisdictions. It states that the judges consider that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro were unjustified and orders the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless consider that Mr. Acua Castro did not prove that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.In addition, states the Government, proceedings have been instituted before the San Jos labour court against the Bank of Costa Rica in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves. The proceedings, which began on  April , are not yet completed.
.The Committee notes the decision of the Supreme Court concerning the first of the persons cited by the complainants. In this connection, the Committee has pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of an act of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts judged that Mr. Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees, had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Committee considers it desirable that the Government should re-examine this case and envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro.
.In addition, the Committee feels obliged to point out that, although the aforementioned order of the Supreme Court is dated  August , the Government made no mention of it in its earlier communications (dated  May ). The Committee can only regret that this was not done, and trusts that the Government will communicate a copy of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves as soon as this has been rendered. In the latter connection, the Committee notes that Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed over a year ago and that the legal proceedings are not yet completed. It wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities
.The CGT also alleged that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, had first been removed from his job and subsequently, owing to a strike which had been called by the general assembly of the union for  to  July , had been charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. He was imprisoned and was refused bail.
.In addition, stated the complainants, Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP), had",0,1975,Costa Rica
175,"been dismissed from his job at the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning (where he was also general secretary of the union) and subsequently, on the grounds of a strike called by the workers of the institute, had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga and detained under the same conditions. These two persons were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common law offenders.
.The Government replied that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. For this reason, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic had charged him before the municipal court of Tibs with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. The trial had not yet been completed.
.As regards the case of Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, continued the Government, he had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga, for which he was also being prosecuted before the municipal court of Tibs.
.The Committee took note of this information. It nevertheless noted that the facts impugned go back to July  and that the trade unionists concerned have not yet been brought to trial. Moreover, it was not possible to determine with any certainty whether the persons concerned were still detained. The Committee recalled the importance it attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political nature or under common law, which the Government considers to have no bearing on their trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried rapidly by an impartial and independent judicial authority. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had drawn the Government's attention to this principle and requested it to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the two cases.
.In its letter of  April  the Government states that proceedings have been instituted against the two abovementioned trade unionists before the Higher Court of San Jos, which has ordered them to be released on , colons bail each
.It would appear from available information that proceedings have been instituted against two trade union officials for strikes in public services. They have nevertheless been released on bail. The Committee has stressed on a number of occasions that recognition of the right of public employees to organise does not imply the right to strike.
.Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, the Committee has pointed out in a number of cases concerning Costa Rica that, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented. In the present case, section  of the Labour code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for settlement.
.Nevertheless, in one of the above-mentioned cases relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special act setting up the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. The Committee therefore feels it to be necessary, in the present case, for the Government to specify whether section  was applicable to the collective labour disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.The National Union of Social Security Employees alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected.
.The Government had supplied no comments in this connection. In November  the Committee recalled that freedom of assembly and election by trade union organisations, without interference by employers and the public authorities, constitutes an essential guarantee of the free exercise of trade union rights. Furthermore, Article  of Convention no.  stipulates that workers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by employers (either directly, or by their agents or members) in their establishment, functioning or administration. In particular, acts which are designed to support workers' organisations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, are deemed to constitute acts of interference. The Governing Body had requested the Government to communicate its observations on this aspect of the case.
.The Government has still not supplied comments in this connection.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not yet seen fit to reply to these allegations, which refer to incidents that took place three years ago. In an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention, and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that the occupational organisations were provided by the national legislation with the means to enforce the rights guaranteed to them under the said provisions.) The Committee subsequently noted that Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to protect workers' organisations from acts of interference by employers and their organisations. According to section  of the Labour Code ""any case not provided for by this Code, the regulations hereunder or acts supplementary or related thereto shall be decided in accordance with the general principles of labour law, equity and local custom and usage; in default thereof the provisions laid down in the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Organisation shall be applied in the first place, in so far as they are not contrary to the laws of the country, and thereafter the principles and enactments of ordinary law"". The Committee had also pointed out that Convention No. , by virtue of its ratification by Costa Rica, had been incorporated in the national legislation, and accordingly considered that it would be most appropriate for the Government to examine the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions ensuring the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers and their organisations.
.The Committee considers that these conclusions are also applicable in the present case. It would appear from an observation made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in  that a draft law concerning collective labour relations containing provisions giving protection to workers' organisations against acts of interference has been submitted to the legislative assembly but has not yet been adopted.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the dismissal of two trade union officials, to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro in his employment, and also to request it to transmit the text of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor;(b) as regards the arrest of two other trade union officials:(i) to recall the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  and  regarding strikes in public services;(ii) to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code is applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Town Planning;(iii) to note that Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes have been released on bail, and to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in their cases, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) as regards the interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly, to urge the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaints of the National Union of Social Security Employees, the General Confederation of workers and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica are contained in communications dated  June ,  August ",-1,1975,Costa Rica
176,"and  March  respectively. The texts of these communications were transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations in letters of  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations relating to interference by the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the Union of Social Security Employees in June ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the terms of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), quoted in paragraph  above;(c) to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements rendered in the cases concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro and Mr. Sobrado Chaves;(d) to draw attention to the principle set forth in paragraph  above concerning guarantees of rapid judicial procedure, and to request the Government to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the proceedings against Mr. Alfaro Ziga and Mr. Devandas Brenes. Mr. Devandas Brenes;(e) to take note of the present interim report.",1,1975,Costa Rica
177,".The Latin American Federation of Workers in the Timber and Construction Industry (FLATICOM) presented a complaint by a communication of  August  alleging violation of freedom of association in Costa Rica.
.The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which submitted its comments by a letter dated  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.FLATICOM alleged in its complaint that members of the Executive Council of the union of the Association of Prefabricated Houses of the firm Terrenos, Urbanizaciones y Casas SA (TUCASA), which is affiliated to it, had been persecuted. The complainant organisation stated that on  July  seven leaders of that union, including the general secretary, had been unfairly dismissed.
.According to the complainants, this action proved clearly that there was anti-union discrimination in that undertaking. FLATICOM enclosed with its letter a communication which it had addressed to the Minister of Labour and Social Security, in which it called for the reinstatement of these union leaders.
.In its reply, the Government stated that it was quite possible that the undertaking was experiencing a difficult financial situation during the year , which would have explained the large-scale dismissals of workers from the undertaking during that period, since it was already evident that the firm was going bankrupt. Thus, continued the Government, from January to July ,  workers were dismissed, including the seven union leaders, and other persons had resigned.
.The dismissal of the union leaders resulted in the filing of a complaint for union persecution, on  July, by the Costa Rican Workers' Confederation with the National Directorate of Labour Inspection of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security. The text of the complaint in question is appended to the Government's communication.
.The Government also enclosed with its communication a copy of the report which the Inspector responsible for the case addressed to the National Director of Labour Inspection. In this document, the Inspector concluded that on the basis of the evidence produced ""there was persecution of the workers forming the union's executive council"". The matter was transmitted to a higher authority but, whilst the necessary complaints were being prepared for submission to the courts, the company filed a bankruptcy petition with the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice. Considering that it was of little importance to pursue the complaint for anti-trade union discrimination, but that it was more important to solve the serious social problem of unemployment, the Government endeavoured to help the workers and to ensure the payment of their entitlements and compensation. Consequently, the Government asked that the complaint be rejected.
.The Committee has always considered as a basic principle of freedom of association that workers must be adequately protected against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. This protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union delegates, since, in order to perform their trade union functions in complete independence, they must have the assurance that their trade union activities will not cause them any prejudice.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that an inquiry was carried out by the labour inspectorate after the dismissals, and that the matter was about to be referred to the courts when the undertaking went bankrupt.
.In these circumstances, and in view of the bankruptcy of the undertaking in question, whilst recalling the principles mentioned in paragraph  above, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of this case.",1,1975,Costa Rica
178,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1975,Dominican Republic
179,".The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May and November ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, which are to be found in its nd Report (paragraphs  to ), st Report (paragraphs  to ) and th Report (paragraphs  to ). The Governing Body approved these reports in November  and in June and November  (th, th and th Sessions), respectively. The Government handed over various documents with a bearing on the case at an interview on  June  between the Minister of Labour and the Chairman of the Committee, and supplied further information in a communication dated  July .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its sessions in June and November , the Committee made certain comments in relation to the question of principle raised by the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the affairs of its employees' union. In September  the Government sent information with respect to one aspect of the question, namely the reasons for the dismissal of a trade union official.
.Recalling its conclusions in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that ratification of Convention No.  involved an undertaking, under the terms of Article  of that Convention, to ensure that workers' organisations in particular were provided by the legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their organisations. Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in June , the Governing Body urged the Government to adopt the necessary provisions without delay in a communication dated  September , the Government stated that it had taken note of these recommendations, which the Governing Body reiterated in November  when it approved paragraph  of the Committee's th Report.
.In its further observations of  July  the Government states that the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the union UNDECA never took place. Among the documents supplied is an attestation by the authorities of the Fund to the effect that an examination of the accounts for the period to which the complaint refers ( and ) shows that the Fund did not pay the travelling expenses of workers as an inducement to attend a certain trade union meeting, as has been claimed by the complainants. The Government also draws attention to the information furnished earlier to the effect that a judgement pronounced in August  had declared it not proven that Mr. Carlos Acua Castro, an official of the union, had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities. The Government supplies the text of this judgement. In addition, in letters sent to the ILO by Mr. Acuo Castro - now a Ministry of Labour official - and a number of the UNDECA officials who had signed the complaint, it is acknowledged that the facts were not as serious as was claimed in the first place.
.The Committee notes this information. It nevertheless considers that its general conclusions as to the need for legislative provisions which will protect workers' organisations against possible interference by employers are still applicable. In effect, to give the necessary publicity to provisions such as those of Article  of the Convention and ensure that full effect is given to them in practice, even in cases where ratification has the effect of incorporating the international standard in municipal law, it is highly important that these provisions, accompanied by provision for appeals and penalties to ensure that they are complied with, should be embodied explicitly in the relevant legislation. The Committee is therefore of the opinion that the recommendations already approved by the Governing Body in this respect should be maintained.
.The other matters still outstanding concern the dismissal from their jobs of three other officials of unions of employees in the public sector and the criminal proceedings brought by the authorities against two of them. These events occurred in  and . According to the allegations, Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service workers, were dismissed from their jobs. Subsequently, according to the complainants, because of strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions, they were charged with incitement to strike and other offences and imprisoned. The Government stated that Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during a strike in July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and that the Public Prosecutor had charged both him and Devandas Brenes with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of public services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Both were to be brought to trial and the court had allowed them to be released on bail.
.Bearing in mind the principles it had upheld in this connection, the Committee examined the provisions of the Labour Code which prohibit strikes in the public services and make it compulsory for any disputes between employers and workers in this sector to be referred to the labour courts. The Committee pointed out in particular that where strikes were prohibited or restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interest of the workers to the full, including in particular the existence of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties could take part at every stage and in which the awards were binding in all cases on both parties and must be fully and promptly implemented. In this connection the Government confirmed that the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed in the Labour Code was applicable to disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in November  the Governing Body requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.The remaining dismissal involved Mr. Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica. He had been dismissed in February , according to the complainants, on the false pretext of unjustified absences from work. The Government stated inter alia that legal proceedings were pending in connection with this matter. In November  the Committee and the Governing Body drew attention to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. The Government was requested to supply the text of the judgement handed down in the case relating to the dismissal of Mr. Sobrado Chaves.
.The documents and observations communicated by the Government on  June and  July  include the texts of the judgements requested. As concerns Mr. Devandas Brenes, it is stated in the judgements pronounced by the labour court and the Higher Labour Court in September and October  that he was discharged on  March  by the institute of Housing and Town Planning together with other workers, as part of a retrenchment of staff rendered necessary by financial difficulties. The judges considered it proven that Mr. Devandas Brenes had been dismissed for this reason and not arbitrarily or as a means of anti-union persecution, and that the employer had obtained authorisation in advance from an advisory board as required by the collective agreement. As regards Mr. Alfaro Ziga, the judgements, likewise of first and second instance, pronounced in March and May  state that he was dismissed in February  by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The union had filed a complaint with the Legislative Assembly against the authorities of the Institute, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. The Assembly set up a commission of inquiry. Later the union executive had a statement published in the press accusing the authorities of the institute of anti-union persecution. The latter enjoined Mr. Alfaro Ziga to substantiate some of the charges made, which he did not do himself, but left it to the union, whereupon he was dismissed. The court considered that the dismissal was justified, observing, inter alia, that while the union was a separate legal entity from its members, this fact did not exonerate Mr. Alfaro Ziga from his responsibilities as an employee in his relations with his employer. According to the court, the statement published by the union was based on charges made personally by this employee, who did not substantiate them as instructed by his employer, and was thus guilty of dishonesty and disloyalty. The court considered that there was just cause for dismissal on the ground of serious non-compliance with the obligations deriving from a contract of employment as specified in the Labour Code.
.The Government also supplies information concerning the criminal proceedings initiated in  against Messrs. Devandas Brenes and Alfaro Ziga on charges of riot",1,1975,Costa Rica
180,"Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and of Mario Devanda Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP) and of the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. According to the complainants, both had first been dismissed from their jobs; subsequently, because of the strike called by the workers of the establishments in which they had been employed, they were charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. Both were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common criminals.
.The Government had replied that Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The Public Prosecutor had brought charges against him of riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Mario Devanda Brenes had been charged with the same offences. The Government stated that these two persons were to be brought to trial before the Higher Court of San Jose, which had ordered them to be released on bail of , colons each.
.Proceedings had therefore been instituted against the two trade unionists for strikes in public services. The Committee recalled, in this connection, that recognition of the right of public employees to organise did not imply the right to strike. Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented.
.In the present case, section  of the Labour Code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for compulsory settlement. Nevertheless, in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special law setting up the Costa Rican Electricity institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the Institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. In June , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code was applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning. The Governing Body had also requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of the principles and considerations outlined above and specifies that section  of the Labour code is fully applicable to the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, pursuant to section , paragraphs (a) and (d), of the Code:For the purposes of the last preceding section () the following shall be deemed to be public services:(a) all work performed by persons in the employment of the State or a state institution, if the work in question is not of the same nature as work performed also by private undertakings carried on for profit;(d) work performed by employees who are strictly indispensable for the maintenance in operation of private undertakings which cannot suspend their services without causing serious and immediate prejudice to public health or public economy in general, such as clinics and hospitals, and municipal hygiene, cleaning and lighting services;The Government adds that the trial of Alfaro Ziga and Devanda Brenes is still before the Higher Penal Court, following an appeal by the defence.
.The Committee takes note of this information.
.Finally, the Committee had received allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union officials. According to the Complainants, Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Acua Castro in the elections. It was further alleged that Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO), had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the Bank. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.The Government affirmed that, according to the Social Security Fund, Acua Castro's dismissal constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. Nevertheless, the Labour Court and, subsequently, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos had judged that the suit filed by Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  August , the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court had confirmed this decision. It stated that the judges considered that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Acua Castro were unjustified and ordered the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless considered that Acua Castro had not proved that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.The Government further stated that, on  August , the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for authorisation to dismiss Cristin Sobrado Chaves. The Bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. On  February , Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The Bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the labour judge of San Jos but that the proceedings, which began on  April , were not yet completed.
.The Committee noted the decision of the Supreme Court concerning Acua Castro. In this connection, it pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts had judged that the trade union official had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, had requested the Government to envisage the possibility of reinstating Acua Castro in his employment. The Committee further noted that Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed a long time ago and that the legal proceedings were not yet completed. It recalled the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, and the Governing Body had requested the Government to transmit, as soon as it was pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in the case of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor.
.In its letter of  September , the Government states that Acua Castro held for several months the post of chief of the technical co-operation and international affairs unit of the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, which he had left of his own free will to take up a post in the private sector. As regards Sobrado Chaves, adds the Government, this case is still before the Labour Court but the judgement is expected to be handed down very soon and will be communicated to the ILO as soon",-1,1975,Costa Rica
181,"as it is pronounced.
.The Committee takes note of this information. However, it feels bound to draw attention once again to the considerable time that elapsed between the dismissal of Sobrado Chaves on  February  and the institution of legal proceedings. It wishes to repeat that a particularly rapid procedure should be applied for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. Any worker who is dependent on his employment will inevitably have difficulty in waiting for a long time once he has been deprived of his job because of what appears to him to be antiunion discrimination. Some countries have tackled this problem by means of emergency summary procedures; in the view of the Committee, adoption of such procedures on a temporary or permanent basis would undoubtedly help to improve the system of protection against forms of anti-union discrimination, especially dismissals.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government once again to secure the adoption without delay of the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers;(b) to take note of the information communicated by the Government concerning the existence of a compulsory arbitration procedure where strikes are prohibited, as in the case of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning and to request it to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to draw the Government's attention, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities, to request it to communicate, as soon as it is pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down in respect of Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor, and to note further the information provided by the Government on Acua Castro;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November , when it submitted the interim conclusions contained in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (November ).
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding refer to the dismissal or arrest of trade union officials and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly. The Government sent further information by a letter of  April .
.According to the National Union of Social Security Employees (UNDECA), Mr. Carlos Manuel Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary UNDECA, had been dismissed on  June  from his post as legal inspector at the Social Security Fund on the grounds that he had been attending courses at the law faculty, whereas in reality, according to the complainants, he had merely sat for the examinations with the authorisation of his employer. The complainants considered that this situation was the consequence of the complaint presented to the Council of State (Contralora general de la Repblica) on the subject of the interference of the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the union and the participation of Mr. Acua Castro in the elections.
.The General Confederation of Workers (CGT) and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica (UNEBANCO) referred to the situation of Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of UNEBANCO. It was alleged that Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been dismissed without due cause on  February , after the Higher Labour Court had pronounced the dismissal unjustified. Furthermore, according to the complainants, this measure was a violation of the arbitration award in force at the bank. Mr. Sobrado Chaves had been reproached with unjustified absence from work although, according to the complainants, he had absented himself with the authorisation of his immediate supervisors to carry out activities related to a collective dispute which the bank workers had brought before the labour judge.
.As regards the dismissal of Mr. Carl Os Manuel Acua Castro, the Government referred to a circular issued by the office of the Chairman of the Social Security Fund. It affirmed that the versions given of the case were untrue and that the measure in question constituted a sanction for a misdemeanour committed by a worker and should not be artificially connected with other events which had nothing to do with the case. The Government stated that on  January  the court of first instance, the San Jos labour court, judged that the suit filed by Mr. Acua Castro against the Social Security Fund was receivable. On  April  the court of second instance, the Higher Labour Court of San Jos, upheld this judgement. Finally, the Social Security Fund had filed an appeal before the Supreme Court for the quashing of the sentence. The Supreme Court had not yet given judgement.
.The Government further indicated that on  August  the Bank of Costa Rica had applied to the labour courts which were examining the collective labour dispute raised by the bank workers for, authorisation to dismiss Mr. Christin Sobrado Chaves. The bank had alleged that the accused had committed unpardonable breaches of discipline. The courts considered that the dismissal was unjustified. On  February , Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed on the grounds of unjustified absences from work. The bank informed him that, since the arbitration of the collective labour dispute was completed, it was at full liberty to apply the disciplinary sanctions corresponding to the misdemeanour concerned. The Government indicated that the case in question was now under examination by the judicial authorities as the judges had expressed the view that the grounds for dismissal were controversial and might be diversely construed.
.In November , the Committee noted that these two cases had been brought before the competent courts, where they were still pending. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had requested the Government to supply the text of any judgements rendered.
.The Government attaches to its communication of  April  the judgement rendered by the Division of Cassation of the Supreme Court concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund. This decision, dated  August , confirms those of the lower jurisdictions. It states that the judges consider that the reasons given by the employer for the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro were unjustified and orders the Fund to pay him nine months' wages as compensation, taking account of his seniority in employment. The judges nevertheless consider that Mr. Acua Castro did not prove that he had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities and was accordingly not entitled to compensation on this account.
.In addition, states the Government, proceedings have been instituted before the San Jos labour court against the Bank of Costa Rica in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves. The proceedings, which began on  April , are not yet completed.
.The Committee notes the decision of the Supreme Court concerning the first of the persons cited by the complainants. In this connection, the Committee has pointed out on a number of occasions that a worker may frequently find it difficult or even impossible to furnish proof that he has been the victim of an act of anti-union discrimination. In the present case, the competent courts judged that Mr. Acua Castro, Deputy General Secretary of the National Union of Social Security Employees, had been dismissed without just cause. In these circumstances, the Committee considers it desirable that the Government should re-examine this case and envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro.
.In addition, the Committee feels obliged to point out that, although the aforementioned order of the Supreme Court is dated  August , the Government made no mention of it in its earlier communications (dated  May ). The Committee can only regret that this was not done, and trusts that the Government will communicate a copy of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves as soon as this has been rendered. In the latter connection, the Committee notes that Mr. Sobrado Chaves was dismissed over a year ago and that the legal proceedings are not yet completed. It wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the application of a rapid procedure for the examination of alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities
.The CGT also alleged that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, had first been removed from his job and subsequently, owing to a strike which had been called by the general assembly of the union for  to  July , had been charged by the public prosecutor's office with incitement to strike and other offences. He was imprisoned and was refused bail.
.In addition, stated the complainants, Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service Workers (FENATRAP), had",0,1975,Costa Rica
182,"been dismissed from his job at the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning (where he was also general secretary of the union) and subsequently, on the grounds of a strike called by the workers of the institute, had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga and detained under the same conditions. These two persons were being held at the public prison of Heredia, along with common law offenders.
.The Government replied that Mr. Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during the strike called on  July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. For this reason, the Public Prosecutor of the Republic had charged him before the municipal court of Tibs with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of services and conduct prejudicial to public order. The trial had not yet been completed.
.As regards the case of Mr. Mario Devandas Brenes, continued the Government, he had been charged with the same offences as Mr. Alfaro Ziga, for which he was also being prosecuted before the municipal court of Tibs.
.The Committee took note of this information. It nevertheless noted that the facts impugned go back to July  and that the trade unionists concerned have not yet been brought to trial. Moreover, it was not possible to determine with any certainty whether the persons concerned were still detained. The Committee recalled the importance it attached to the principle that in all cases, including those in which trade unionists are charged with offences of a political nature or under common law, which the Government considers to have no bearing on their trade union activities, the persons concerned should be tried rapidly by an impartial and independent judicial authority. On its recommendations, the Governing Body had drawn the Government's attention to this principle and requested it to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the two cases.
.In its letter of  April  the Government states that proceedings have been instituted against the two abovementioned trade unionists before the Higher Court of San Jos, which has ordered them to be released on , colons bail each
.It would appear from available information that proceedings have been instituted against two trade union officials for strikes in public services. They have nevertheless been released on bail. The Committee has stressed on a number of occasions that recognition of the right of public employees to organise does not imply the right to strike.
.Nevertheless, since the right to strike is an essential means available to the workers and their organisations for defending and promoting their occupational interests, the Committee has pointed out in a number of cases concerning Costa Rica that, where strikes are prohibited or severely restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers to the full. Among such guarantees the Committee has made special mention of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage and in which the awards are binding in all cases on both parties; these awards, once they have been made, should be fully and promptly implemented. In the present case, section  of the Labour code prohibits strikes in the public services, and any disputes which may arise between employers and workers in these sectors must be referred to the labour courts for settlement.
.Nevertheless, in one of the above-mentioned cases relating to Costa Rica, the complainants alleged that, under the special act setting up the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, this body was not obliged to submit to compulsory arbitration. The Government had supplied no information on this point. The Committee considered that, if the allegation was correct, the workers of the institute would be deprived not only of the right to strike but also of the other safeguards mentioned to protect their occupational interests. The Committee therefore feels it to be necessary, in the present case, for the Government to specify whether section  was applicable to the collective labour disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.The National Union of Social Security Employees alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected.
.The Government had supplied no comments in this connection. In November  the Committee recalled that freedom of assembly and election by trade union organisations, without interference by employers and the public authorities, constitutes an essential guarantee of the free exercise of trade union rights. Furthermore, Article  of Convention no.  stipulates that workers' organisations shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by employers (either directly, or by their agents or members) in their establishment, functioning or administration. In particular, acts which are designed to support workers' organisations by financial or other means, with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, are deemed to constitute acts of interference. The Governing Body had requested the Government to communicate its observations on this aspect of the case.
.The Government has still not supplied comments in this connection.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not yet seen fit to reply to these allegations, which refer to incidents that took place three years ago. In an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention, and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that the occupational organisations were provided by the national legislation with the means to enforce the rights guaranteed to them under the said provisions.) The Committee subsequently noted that Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to protect workers' organisations from acts of interference by employers and their organisations. According to section  of the Labour Code ""any case not provided for by this Code, the regulations hereunder or acts supplementary or related thereto shall be decided in accordance with the general principles of labour law, equity and local custom and usage; in default thereof the provisions laid down in the Conventions and Recommendations adopted by the International Labour Organisation shall be applied in the first place, in so far as they are not contrary to the laws of the country, and thereafter the principles and enactments of ordinary law"". The Committee had also pointed out that Convention No. , by virtue of its ratification by Costa Rica, had been incorporated in the national legislation, and accordingly considered that it would be most appropriate for the Government to examine the possibility of adopting clear and precise provisions ensuring the adequate protection of workers' organisations against any acts of interference by employers and their organisations.
.The Committee considers that these conclusions are also applicable in the present case. It would appear from an observation made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in  that a draft law concerning collective labour relations containing provisions giving protection to workers' organisations against acts of interference has been submitted to the legislative assembly but has not yet been adopted.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the dismissal of two trade union officials, to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraph , to envisage the possibility of reinstating Mr. Acua Castro in his employment, and also to request it to transmit the text of the judgement given in the case of Mr. Sobrado Chaves, with the reasons adduced therefor;(b) as regards the arrest of two other trade union officials:(i) to recall the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  and  regarding strikes in public services;(ii) to request the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to state whether the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes provided for under section  of the Labour Code is applicable to disputes in the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Town Planning;(iii) to note that Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes have been released on bail, and to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in their cases, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) as regards the interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly, to urge the Government, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and , to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaints of the National Union of Social Security Employees, the General Confederation of workers and the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica are contained in communications dated  June ,  August ",-1,1975,Costa Rica
183,"and  March  respectively. The texts of these communications were transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations in letters of  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations relating to interference by the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the Union of Social Security Employees in June ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the terms of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), quoted in paragraph  above;(c) to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements rendered in the cases concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro and Mr. Sobrado Chaves;(d) to draw attention to the principle set forth in paragraph  above concerning guarantees of rapid judicial procedure, and to request the Government to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the proceedings against Mr. Alfaro Ziga and Mr. Devandas Brenes. Mr. Devandas Brenes;(e) to take note of the present interim report.",1,1975,Costa Rica
184,"whether they be first degree trade unions, federations or Confederations;- the preliminary draft of the new Political Constitution of the State, which will shortly be the subject of a referendum, provides that trade union organisations shall be granted legal personality subject to no other formality than the depositing of their Constitutions and rules with an independent body in accordance with a procedure to be prescribed by law;- the new legislation will recognise freedom of assembly without supervision by the authorities, already widely exercised today;- it will establish a procedure for the election, removal from office and replacement of union officials in full freedom and by secret ballot, without interference by the authorities or by extraneous elements;- it will guarantee the freedom to run their own affairs and autonomy of organisations by making improvements in the law on trade union dues (Legislative Decree No. ) so as to enable trade unions to be financially independent. In this connection, the Government recalls that the laws and regulations presently in force provide for machinery for financial control by the general assembly and supervisory Committee of a trade union;- it will provide for an appeal to lie with the courts of justice to settle any cases which may arise in connection with the dissolution of trade union organisations.
.In conclusion, the Government states that freedom to join the trade union of one's choice and freedom for each union to determine the amount of the dues to be paid by its members and to elect its officials are the main, necessary features on which the new law will be based. The Bill is now in the final stages of drafting and is still the subject of debate in the legislative bodies and consultation with the organisations concerned.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statements as concerns the promulgation of the new trade union legislation, due to take place by  June  at the latest. It notes with interest that in the meantime the Government has adopted a new legislative decree which amends the provisions adopted in February  with respect to the right of assembly of trade union organisations in trade union premises and abolishes the requirement that the authorities be notified in advance which still subsisted in certain cases. However, the Committee must point out that trade unions ought to have the right to freely organise meetings either in trade union premises or in other appropriate premises.
.The Committee has examined the guiding principles for the new trade union legislation. It notes with interest that, as communicated to the Committee, they appear to have taken account to a large extent of the principles mentioned by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission in its recommendations with regard to the adoption of new trade union legislation. Nevertheless, the Committee must point out once again that it cannot express its views as to the conformity of the new legislation with the principles of freedom of association until it has at its disposal all the necessary information, and in particular the full text of the new provisions. In this connection it must express its deep regret that the Government has not found it possible to supply the text of the Bill before it becomes law. In these circumstances, the Committee can only urge the Government to take all the necessary measures so that the new legislation will be adopted before  June next and will contain provisions complying with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and that the text will be sent promptly to the Committee so that it can evaluate its conformity with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee further considers it desirable to insist once again on the need for the bringing into force, speedily and fully, of legislation complying with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission so as to put an end to all the restrictions on trade unions which have now been in force for nearly six years.
.In presenting the Government's ""Social Plan"" at the beginning of January , the Minister of Labour stated that what had to be aimed for was a system of collective bargaining which would be:- effective and just, which would suggest that it be conducted within each undertaking;- technical, which would require that both parties negotiate with full knowledge of the relevant factors involved and with the aid of any technical assistance required;- responsible and integrated, which could only be achieved within the framework of conciliation procedures. According to the minister, striking could not be legally accepted when it affected services in the public interest or when a work stoppage seriously impaired the populations' health or food supplies, the country's economy or national security. On the other hand, in cases where the State or the population was not vitally affected, there was nothing preventing the possibility of occupational strikes and lock-outs.
.The Minister of Labour further pointed out that his statements on collective bargaining did not concern employees of the State and municipalities. Finally, he indicated that the legislation respecting collective bargaining would enter into force before  June .
.At its February  session, the Committee noted with interest that the procedure of compulsory arbitration would not be applied to all collective labour disputes. It pointed out, however, that the law should not stand in the way of the participation of federations and Confederations in voluntary collective negotiations concerning conditions of work. In drawing the Government's attention to these principles and considerations, the Governing Body expressed the hope that collective bargaining would be restored in the very near future.
.In its communication of  may , the Government confirms that the law on collective bargaining will be promulgated before  June . It recalls that its aim is to provide workers and employers with negotiating machinery which will be efficient, fair, technically competent and responsible. The ""Social Plan"" recognises the right of workers to associate for the collective negotiation of their rates of pay so that these may be consistent with the productivity of the sector of the undertaking concerned. This implies that, for both employers and workers, collective bargaining should take place within each undertaking. This is not a hard-and-fast rule, as special circumstances justifying its waiving may arise in activities where the labour force is exceptionally mobile.
.As concerns the Committee's recommendation to the effect that ""the law should not stand in the way of the participation of federations and Confederations in voluntary collective negotiations concerning conditions of work"", the Government states that the new legislation does not preclude such participation. On the contrary, it recognises in broad and clear terms the role of federations and Confederations. These organisations are in effect in a better position to carry out certain tasks of interest to workers employed in different undertakings in a given branch of activity. They may also be of great value in training officials of first-degree unions and assisting them prior to or during negotiations.
.The Government points out that in the interest of consumers, it must ensure that in certain sectors a few workers' or employers' organisations do not acquire monopolistic powers enabling them to secure excessively advantageous pay rates or privileges. According to the Government, in certain sectors there is in fact a tendency towards collusion between employers' and workers' associations with a view to reaching settlements which are mutually advantageous. However, these settlements are not based on an improvement in productivity and are thus detrimental to consumers as they result in higher prices. The Government goes on to state that it is accordingly necessary to make the laws against monopolies of either workers or employers more severe.
.The Committee notes that collective bargaining at the undertaking level - a system traditionally used in Chile and sanctioned by the Labour Code formerly in force, - will be re-established under new legislation on the subject. The Committee is of the opinion that the reintroduction of collective bargaining is an important step forward in the restoration of trade union freedoms.
.The Committee notes that federations and Confederations will be allowed to give advice and assistance in connection with collective bargaining, and that it will be permissible for such higher-degree organisations, in certain cases, to negotiate directly the conditions of employment of their constituents. The Committee further notes that the general rule it is intended to observe in establishing the legal framework for collective bargaining at the undertaking level reflects the desire to prevent the creation of monopolies either on the employers' or on the workers' side. In this connection, the Committee wishes to draw attention to the importance of the principle that voluntary negotiation of collective agreements between employers' and workers' organisations should be promoted. The Committee observes that the system of collective bargaining provided for would result in practice in negotiations between individual employers and unions at the undertaking level, excluding employers' organisations and higher-degree workers' organisations. In these circumstances, the Committee is of the opinion that, to prevent all these organisations from being debarred a priori from taking part in collective bargaining, the combating of possible",0,1975,Chile
185,"it again made an urgent appeal to the Government to supply the information.
.Regarding Cases Nos. , ,  and , the complaints and additional information submitted by the complainants appear in the following communications: three communications, of  October ,  September  and  June , from the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), a communication of  November , from the National Federation of Dockworkers, two communications, of  May  and  November , from the Stevedores' Union (POASI), a communication of  August , from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), two communications, of  September  and  July , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), three communications, of  November ,  July and  October , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL).
.These complaints were transmitted to the Government as they were received, with requests for observations. Apart from some very general replies sent by communications of  January and  July , and despite the time which had elapsed since the presentation of the first complaints (Case No. ), the Committee received no information from the Government on the various allegations. In November  and May , the Committee sent urgent requests to the Government to submit the information requested (Case No. ).
.As the information requested on all these cases was not received, the Committee asked the Director-General in November  to communicate with the highest level of the Government, on behalf of the Committee, expressing the Committee's concern and urgently requesting the Government to provide the observations requested from it (Cases Nos. , ,  and ). The Government finally submitted information by communications of ,  and  February .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).",-1,1975,Dominican Republic
186,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined Case No.  in May and November  and on each occasion it submitted a report to the Governing Body. These reports appear in paragraphs  to  of the Committee's st report and paragraphs  to  of its rd report.
.In its rd Report, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body request the Government to provide additional information on one aspect of the matter. Despite repeated requests, this information was not received. The Committee, therefore, addressed urgent appeals to the Government in November  and February and May  that it supply the information requested. In November  and February , the Committee noted with regret that despite its appeals the requested information still had not been received. In May ",-1,1975,Dominican Republic
187,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",-1,1975,Dominican Republic
188,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1975,Dominican Republic
189,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",-1,1975,Dominican Republic
190,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1975,Dominican Republic
191,"and incitement to a collective stoppage of public services. According to the indictment put before the criminal court, on the occasion of a strike at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute in July of that year, these persons, who had no connection with the Institute (Mr. Alfaro Ziga having been dismissed from it a few months earlier, as stated above), insinuated themselves into the movement and by haranguing them and making subversive speeches incited some  workers to take part in a collective cessation of their public duties; they succeeded in persuading them to stop work, thus paralysing the main electricity supply plant. Also according to the indictment, the strike had been declared unlawful that very same day by the labour court - a ruling not found acceptable by the strikers, who insulted and stoned the Civil Guardsmen who arrived two days later to enforce the court order.
.The Government furnishes a judicial attestation to the effect that in May , when Mr. Devandas Brenes was elected to be a member of the Legislative Assembly, the examining magistrate eliminated him from the proceedings, which he continued with respect to the other accused. The Government considers that it has demonstrated that these persons participated in an unlawful strike staged in an institution for which they did not work and not ""in strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions"" it further states that neither the dismissals nor the measures taken to preserve law and order constituted breaches of the ILO Conventions on freedom of association.
.With regard to Mr. Sobrado Chaves, who, as stated above, was General Secretary of the Onion of Bank Employees of Costa Rica at the time of his dismissal, the Government also supplies the text of the judgement pronounced by the labour judge and confirmed on appeal, rejecting his claim against the bank. These judgements state that in connection with a collective dispute, Mr. Sobrado Chaves was appointed by the employees of the bank to be one of their representatives at a conciliation tribunal. The bank authorities considered that he was subsequently guilty of unjustified absences and requested authorisation from the courts to dismiss him, which was refused so long as the collective dispute was still pending. The bank dismissed him as soon as the dispute was settled in the judgement it is declared proven that this person absented himself from work  times over a period of two months without having given due notice. The court states that employers may not refuse time off to employees appointed to represent the workers at conciliation proceedings, but that this right of an employee is not unrestricted, but is limited to the time required to attend such proceedings and does not extend to other activities unconnected with the conciliation tribunal. In the case in question, according to the judgement, the repeated absences did not coincide with any of the hearings of the conciliation tribunal.
.The Committee observes that the Government has now supplied detailed information about these events, which occurred some time ago. It considers nevertheless that the texts of the judgements in question have been useful in helping it to reach its conclusions.
.The Committee and the Governing Body have constantly emphasised the importance of the principle that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. In this very case, the Committee has pointed out that such a guarantee is also necessary in the case of trade union officials in order to give effect to the fundamental principle that workers' organisations must have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee has nevertheless stated that this principle does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances. In certain cases the Committee has expressed the view that dismissal for absence from work without the employer's permission does not appear in itself to constitute an infringement of freedom of association.
.As concerns the dismissal of three general secretaries of organisations of workers in the public sector, the Committee observes that they took place in different circumstances and for different reasons, two of the persons concerned being accused of failing in their duty as employees to an extent considered by the country's courts to be sufficiently serious to justify their dis-missal in the other case, the official concerned was one of a group of workers who lost their jobs as a result of a forced reduction in staff.
.In these circumstances, the Committee notes that in the cases to which the complaints refer it has not been proved that there was any infringement of freedom of association. Nevertheless, whatever the grounds for these dismissals may have been, it appears desirable to draw attention to the inevitably prejudicial effects upon trade union organisations and their members, and upon industrial relations, deriving from situations of this kind. The Committee wishes to point out that in the public sector an effective means of helping to prevent such situations may be to put into practice measures inspired by the principles of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not only as concerns the protection of public employees against anti-union discrimination (Article  of the Convention) but also as regards the determination, through negotiation or other methods as provided for in the Convention, of the nature and scope of the facilities to be afforded, without prejudice to the efficient operation of the service concerned, to the representatives of recognised public employees' organisations (Articles  and ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as concerns the question of the protection of workers' organisations against possible acts of interference by employers, to draw the Government's attention once again, for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, to the desirability of adopting special legislative measures in order to give full effect to this principle;(b) with regard to the dismissal of trade union officials in the public sector:(i) to take note of the fact that the Government has supplied the texts of the judgements pronounced in these cases, from which it appears that in the cases in question there has been no infringement of freedom of association;(ii) nevertheless, with a view to preventing possible acts of anti-union discrimination and the harmful consequences deriving from the dismissal of trade union officials, to draw attention to the importance of putting into practice the measures indicated in paragraph  above;(c) to bring this report to the notice of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report and in paragraphs  to  of its st Report, respectively. The Governing Body approved the first of these reports at its th Session (November ) and the second at its th Session (June ). The Government sent further information in a letter dated  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When it last examined these cases, the Committee's conclusions related to the dismissal and arrest of trade union leaders and to interference by the Social Security Fund in a trade union assembly.
.With regard to the latter point, the complainants had alleged that the Costa Rican Social Security Fund had interfered with the holding of the union's general assemblies; in particular, it had engaged in manoeuvres to impose certain persons on the trade union leadership and to remove the new executive Committee which had been legally elected. The Government had made no observations on this point and the Committee had expressed its regret that the Government had not done so.
.Referring to the conclusions it had reached in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that in ratifying Convention No.  the Government had undertaken to secure the implementation of the guarantees contained in Article  of the said Convention and was accordingly under the obligation to take steps to ensure that workers' organisations, in particular, were provided by the national legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their associations. Although Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect, a draft law concerning collective labour relations did contain them; the draft law had been submitted to the legislative assembly but had not yet been adopted.
.On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, in June , urged the Government to adopt without delay the draft provisions regarding the protection of workers' organisations against acts of interference by employers or their organisations. In its letter of  September , the Government states that it has taken note of these observations.
.The allegations outstanding also refer to the arrest of Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of",-1,1975,Costa Rica
192,"meeting was called by a small group of trade union leaders so as to hinder the nominal trade union activities in the Province of Concepcin and to interfere with public order. The Government states that Chilean law provides for legitimate methods, which are appropriate and easy to utilise, for groups representing workers to form organisations. But, in order to do this, these must be a gathering of the assemblies of the affiliated unions. Finally, the Government observes that collective agreements are not normally carried out in the Province of Concepcin.
.While noting the Government's statements, the Committee points out that the planned meeting was to deal with trade union themes. Moreover, according to the allegations, the organisations and participants were trade unionists from different organisations. In this regard it wishes to point out that the authorities ought to avoid any interference of such a nature as to limit the right to hold trade union meetings or to restrict the legal exercise thereof.
.In these circumstances, and regarding the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the adoption of new legislation on trade union organisations and collective bargaining:(i) to note with satisfaction the abrogation of Legislative Decree No.  which had been adopted in December  and which imposed serious restrictions on trade union activities;(ii) to note that the promulgation of the Legislative Decrees on trade union organisations and collective bargaining constitute a first important step in the application of the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations expressed by the Committee in relation to certain provisions of this legislation, which are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining with a view to introducing the necessary amendments.(iv) to express the hope that the legislation will be thus applied in a spirit conforming to the principles of freedom of association and with respect to civil rights, the importance of which had been stressed by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(v) to request the Government to forward information on the implementation of the recommendations referred to in subparagraph (a)(iii) above and to continue to supply information on the practical application of the Legislative Decrees;(b) regarding the removal from office of Mr. Lillo:(i) to point out to the Government the principles expressed in paragraph  above concerning the importance of protection against acts of anti-union discrimination;(ii) to request the Government to indicate whether Legislative Decree No.  has been abrogated as far as workers' organisations in the public sector are concerned;(c) regarding the dissolution of several trade union organisations:(i) to bring the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraph  above;(ii) to request the Government to supply information on the results of the appeals still under way;(d) regarding the detention or disappearance of trade union leaders or members, to request the Government to continue to supply information on the outcome of the proceedings under way and, in general, on the persons mentioned in the list drawn up by the Committee in its th Report and to provide its observations on ICFTU's new allegations;(e) with regard to the prohibition of a meeting in the Province of Concepcin, to point out that the authorities ought to avoid any interference of such a nature as to limit the right to hold trade union meetings or to restrict the legal exercise thereof;(f) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee last examined this case at its February  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Since the Committee last examined the case, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) has made allegations with regard to the removal from office of a trade union official in a telegram addressed to the ILO on  March . In addition the following organisations have sent communications dated as indicated below concerning measures taken by the Government in connection with the celebration of May Day: International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( April ), World Confederation of Labour ( April and  May ), World Federation of Trade Unions ( April and  May ), Latin American Central of Workers ( May ).
.The Government, for its part, has supplied the text of statements made by the Minister of Labour and certain information in communications dated  March and  May . It has furnished its observations in communications dated  May and  May .
.In a statement made on  January , the minister of Labour made public the substance of the ""Social Plan"" setting out the Government's basic objectives and decisions regarding the establishment of a new institutional system for labour matters. The Government stated that the process of working out the ways and means of implementing this ""Social Plan"" had involved numerous meetings with workers' and employers' leaders.
.According to the Government, the principles underlying this ""Social Plan"" should lead to a system of trade unionism with the following characteristics:- free trade unionism, meaning the right of the workers to act collectively through trade unions formed and organised according to the wishes of their members with no other restrictions than those established by law to ensure respect of the common good and the proper functions of the trade unions;- democratic trade unionism, meaning the freedom of the members to appoint their executive organs and the guarantee that the latter act in conformity with the decisions taken by the members;- trade unionism endowed with resources, meaning the obligation of the members to pay contributions to their organisation;- independent and depoliticised trade unionism, which must exclude any use of the trade union organisation by groups or interests which were foreign to it, whatever their nature or origin.
.In presenting the general outline of this ""Social Plan"", the Minister indicated that the law respecting trade union organisations would be enacted before  June . The Government subsequently announced the promulgation of two legislative decrees, one respecting the right of assembly and the other providing for the collection of union dues by a voluntary system of deduction at source.
.At its February-March  Session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation:(i) noted that the Pew trade union legislation was due to be adopted before  June ;(ii) noted with interest that two legislative decrees covering organisations in every sector had been adopted to guarantee the right of trade unions to meet and to favour the collection of members' fees;(iii) recalled to the Government's attention the recommendations formulated by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission concerning the adoption of new trade union legislation;(iv) expressed the firm hope that the Government would be able to provide all the necessary information for a thorough examination of the Bill and the measures envisaged for its application by the Committee at its next session.
.The Government recalls in its communication of  May  that the objectives of the ""Social Plan"" are the strengthening of freedom, the promotion of justice and the establishment of a broad framework propitious to effective progress from which the entire population can benefit. It confirms that the law respecting trade union organisations will be promulgated not later than  June . The guiding principles for the organisation and activities of trade unions as set out in this law will be the development of a free, democratic and independent trade union movement, endowed with its own resources.
.In the meantime, the Government has adopted two legislative decrees: one on the right of assembly of trade unions (Legislative Degree No. , as amended by Legislative Decree No. ), and one on the financing of trade union organisations (Legislative Decree No. ). The Government states that by virtue of the two first mentioned of these legislative decrees Chile has officially guaranteed the freedom of trade union organisations to hold assemblies and meetings without hindrance of any kind. It recalls that Legislative Decree No.  has repealed transitional section  of Legislative Decree No.  of , thus recognising the freedom of trade unions, federations and Confederations to hold meetings outside working hours. Subsequently, Legislative Decree No. , published in the official Gazette on  May , has improved the text of the earlier measure, which lent itself to various interpretations as to the places where it was permissible to hold meetings. Under the new legislative decree, ordinary or extraordinary meetings of trade union organisations (unions, federations and Confederations) may be held at the headquarters of any such organisation, outside working hours, to deal with the affairs of that organisation. Thus, points out the Government, the legislation no longer provides for any restriction of the right of assembly. Moreover, this right has been exercised in practice by trade union organisations since  January last.
.With regard to the new trade union law, the Government gives the following explanations:- it will recognise the right of workers to establish organisations of their own choosing,",0,1975,Chile
193,"and  March  respectively. The texts of these communications were transmitted to the Government, which furnished its observations in letters of  May .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations relating to interference by the Social Security Fund in the general assembly of the Union of Social Security Employees in June ;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the terms of the Workers' Representatives Recommendation,  (No. ), quoted in paragraph  above;(c) to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements rendered in the cases concerning the dismissal of Mr. Acua Castro and Mr. Sobrado Chaves;(d) to draw attention to the principle set forth in paragraph  above concerning guarantees of rapid judicial procedure, and to request the Government to supply the texts of the judgements rendered in the proceedings against Mr. Alfaro Ziga and Mr. Devandas Brenes. Mr. Devandas Brenes;(e) to take note of the present interim report.",1,1975,Costa Rica
194,"on collective bargaining. It considers that the re-establishment of collective bargaining can constitute an important factor in the improvement of labour-management relations in the country. However, the Committee considers that some of the provisions of this Legislative Decree call for comments on its part.
.Firstly, the Committee points out that collective bargaining will not be allowed in state administrations, in companies or public and private undertakings or institutions whose budgets have been financed in the course of the past two years by the State to an extent exceeding  per cent, either directly, or through duties or taxes (article ), or in certain public utility services managed by private companies. The Government states in this regard that, in conformity with Chilean legislation, there is no collective bargaining for public institutions. In the case of those institutions covered by article , the conditions are not listed again according to the Government so that the employer can negotiate freely. The Committee feels that it must recall in this respect the terms of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention (No. ), adopted by the International Labour Conference in , article  of which specifies that - ""Measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for negotiation of terms and conditions of employment between the public authorities concerned and public employees' organisations, or of such other methods as will allow representatives of public employees to participate in the determination of these matters"".
.It appears from articles  and  of the Legislative Decree that collective bargaining will operate exclusively at the level of the undertaking and that federations and Confederations may not engage in collective bargaining, even when it relates to the workers of one and the same undertaking. It also appears from the terms of the provisions concerning the procedure for calling a strike (in particular, article ) that a strike may only to decided by the absolute majority of the workers concerned in the bargaining. Accordingly, it would seem illegal for a federation or Confederation to start a strike.
.Regarding the participation of higher degree organisations in collective bargaining, the Government refers to its May  statements which the Committee examined at its previous session. The Government states that judicial proceedings are not effective in locating and punishing at first instance monopolistic practices. It continues that such practices produce nasty effects upon non-unionised workers, small trade unions, the unemployed, consumers and upon the country's economy in general. The Government observes that unions of little experience or whose power to exert pressure is insufficient have recognised the help that federations can give in collective bargaining. On the other hand, other unions have preferred to bargain through their own methods.
.The Committee wishes to recall in this regard the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations in its general survey of . As for denying federations and Confederations the right to strike and the right to collective bargaining, the Committee of Experts considered that restrictions of this type could give rise to serious difficulties in the development of industrial relations, particularly in the case of small unions which, on account of their limited strength and untrained leadership, may not be able by themselves to further and defend the interests of their members in an effective manner. Regarding the Government's statements on the evil effects of monopolistic practices, the Committee wishes to point out that where clauses in certain collective agreements appear to be in opposition to the considerations of the general interest, a procedure could be envisaged by which the attention of the parties is drawn to those considerations so that they can undertake a new examination, it being understood that they are to remain free in the making of their final decision.
.Article  of the Legislative Decree forbids strikes in undertakings which operate public utility services or where the stoppage of their activity would cause serious prejudice to the health, the supplies for the population, the economy of the country or national security. According to the Legislative Decree, these latter undertakings must represent a significant part of the branch of activity concerned in the country or the stoppage of their activity must make it wholly impossible for a section of the population to receive the services concerned. A list of these undertakings is drawn up every year by a joint decision of the Ministers of Labour, National Defence and Economic Affairs. A compulsory arbitration procedure applies to all the undertakings in question in the event of failure to reach direct agreement. The list drawn up this year, according to the information provided by the Government, includes  undertakings ( public and  private) belonging to the following sectors: certain copper mines, telephones, explosives, telecommunications, public transport, rail transport, air transport, maritime transport, water, electricity, gas, petrol, ports. In this regard the Government states that the special geography of the Chilean territory requires that there should be no paralysation of transport and communication.
.In a general manner, the Committee admitted that the right to strike can be made subject to restrictions, and even prohibition in the government service or essential services, if these limitations are accompanied by corresponding guarantees, because a strike could cause severe damage to the national community. It also considered that strikes cannot apparently but result in such damage if they take place in undertakings that constitute a key sector for the life of the country. The Committee noted that some of the undertakings which appear at present in the list drawn up by the Government seem to correspond to those which are normally considered as essential in the strict sense of the word. However, the Committee must recall that it has pointed out on several occasions, and particularly in cases concerning ports, banks, oil companies and transport, that the principle concerning the prohibition of strikes in essential services may well become meaningless if a strike in one or more undertakings which do not furnish an essential service in the strict sense of the word, i.e. services whose interruption would endanger the existence or well-being of the whole or part of the population, is declared illegal. In the present case, it appears that the listing, made each year by the Government, of the undertakings in which the right to strike is denied could lead to the drawing up of an unduly extensive list by reference to the criteria mentioned above.
.Article  of Legislative Decree No.  enumerates certain matters which may not be the object of collective bargaining. The Committee considers that some of these matters (particularly those which would imply an obligation on the employer to pay salaries to strikers for the strike days, and those which refer to the creation of funds which grant benefits entirely or partly financed by the employer) should not be systematically considered as being outside the scope of collective bargaining.
.As indicated above, the decision to strike must be taken by the absolute majority of the workers concerned (article ). The same is also true for the prolonging of a strike where a vote is called for by the bargaining Committee representing the workers or else by  per cent of the workers concerned (article ).
.In this matter, the Committee must point out that, according to the terms of the voting procedure thus laid down, it may be difficult to obtain an absolute majority, particularly in the case of a trade union having a large number of members. This provision therefore involves the risk of substantial restrictions upon the right to strike.
.The Committee also points out that, according to article , the employer can recruit such workers as he considers necessary and that under article , the workers who maintain their decision not to return to work after  days of strike are considered as having voluntarily resigned. The Government states on this point that the average length of strikes in Chile was  days, and that it is very important for employers to avoid prolonged work stoppages.
.In this respect, the Committee wishes to recall the principle already stated in earlier cases' according to which the use of groups of persons to fill the jobs abandoned as a result of a labour dispute may, if the strike is otherwise legal, only be justified if there is a need to assure the functioning of services or industries whose breakdown would create a situation of acute crisis in the present case, the Committee considers that the combined application of the two above-mentioned provisions involves the risk of weakening considerably the position of the workers and of their organisations in the defence of their occupational and economic interests. Moreover, the Committee wishes to point out that the provision under article  involves a substantial restriction of the right to strike since it in fact limits the duration of strikes to a maximum of  days.
.In accordance with the provisions of article  of the Legislative Decree, in the event of a strike or",0,1975,Chile
195,"up the executive body of the National Federation of Maritime workers following the removal from office of the leader Domingo Sanchez Nunez.
.The information supplied to the representative of the Director-General during the direct contacts mission confirms that Juan Finchiera, Milton Puga and Carlos Arellano, leaders of the Occupational Union of Employees in the Copper Mines of El Teniente, as well as Arturo Latuz, Director of the Occupational Union of Caletones were transferred from their place of residence by an order made in November  by the Ministry of the Interior. Articles in the press indicate that at that time there had been a labour stoppage, or certain of the workers of El Teniente had absented themselves, in order to support their occupational claims. This measure of transfer was lifted on  December  and, according to the persons concerned, they were notified that an end had been put to their labour contracts as soon as they returned home. The undertaking invoked reasons which were directly linked to the measure of transfer. It seems that the undertaking had recourse to one of the reasons for dismissal introduced in the legislation by Decree Law No.  of , namely the participation in illegal acts provoking the absence of workers. In this case the prior authorisation of the courts is not necessary in order to dismiss trade union leaders. The persons concerned appealed to the labour courts and the matter is being dealt with at present. As a result of their loss of employment the persons concerned have automatically lost their trade union responsibilities and they have been replaced by new trade union leaders by virtue of the procedure provided for by Decree Law No. .On  April  the persons concerned requested in writing the intervention of the Minister of the Interior with a view to their reinstatement in their employment and in their trade union offices.
.The Committee notes that the question of the dismissal of the trade union leaders Juan Fincheria, Milton Puga, Carlos Arellano and Arturo Latuz is presently being examined by the labour courts. As regards the loss of trade union office following dismissal the Committee has always considered that national legislation which lays down that all trade union leaders must belong to the occupation in which the organisation functions may jeopardise the exercise of trade union rights. In fact, as is shown in the present case, the laying off of a worker who is a trade union leader can, as well as making him forfeit his position as a trade union official, affect the freedom of action of the organisation and its right to freely elect its representatives and even encourage acts of interference by employers. The Committee considers that the Government, which rapidly lifted the measure of transfer taken against the trade union leaders in question, should intervene so that they may be reinstated in their employment and in their trade union functions. Moreover, the persons concerned remain officials of the bank.
.As regards the trade union leaders Andres del Campo and Antonio Moreno, President and Vice-President of the National Confederation of Hank Associations of the State of Chile, the information gathered by the representative of the Director-General shows that these two trade unionists were elected before December . In December  they were removed from office by the intendant of Santiago on the basis of the provisions of Decree Law No.  of . This decree law, as modified, authorises intendants to request the resignation, and accordingly the removal from office, of trade union leaders from various types of organisations, amongst which are associations of employees or officials in the public sector, when there are serious reasons which justify such a measure being taken. In the case of these two trade union leaders the authority which took the measure referred to the existence of serious ""divergences"" amongst the members of the executive of the trade union. In a letter dated  April  addressed to the President of the Republic by a group of trade union leaders it is pointed out that the members who were still exercising executive office in the Confederation had, however, pointed out to the intendant that this supposed divergence did not exist.
.The representative of the Director-General confirmed that Carlos Frez Rojo, President of the National Federation of Port Workers, was also removed from trade union office by virtue of the provisions of Decree Law No. . Mr. Frez Rojo had been one of the seven trade union leaders transferred to Arica in November , a measure which was lifted in December. The preamble to the decree removing them from office indicates that trade union leaders must see to it that the interests of the workers are safeguarded in the work centres. Mr. Frez Rojo, however, had engaged in activities which had nothing to do with his trade union. The person concerned has not been dismissed from the state enterprise where he works but he has been transferred to the port of Arica where he is at present. The Ministry of the Interior pointed out to the representative of the Director-General that Mr. Frez Rojo had been engaged in political activities in Santiago.
.Finally, as regards Mr. Domingo Sanchez Nunez, leader of a trade union at Talcahuano, affiliated to the Federation of Occupational Unions of Port Employees, it was pointed out to the representative of the Director-General that this person had been called upon by the Federation to fill a vacancy in the executive bodies. Having proceeded thus, the Federation was acting in conformity with Decree Law No.  which provides for the automatic grant of a post falling vacant in the executive body of a federation to the leader of an affiliated organisation who possesses the greatest seniority in the job. Subsequently, however, the labour authorities on the basis of another provision of Decree Law No.  which provides that the seniority rule does not have to be applied ""in cases where by reason of special circumstances it is not possible to apply the provisions of the decree law"" appointed four leaders of primary organisations instead of recognising the appointment of Mr. Sanchez Nunez. These four trade union leaders had just been appointed in their own unions. With the appointment of Mr. Sanchez Nunez the minimum number of trade union leaders laid down by Decree Law No.  was reached. Following the appointment by the Ministry of the four new trade union leaders, all the seats on the executive of the Federation were taken up.
.This question is presently the subject of an appeal for protection lodged with the courts by the Federation. According to the President of the Supreme Court this kind of appeal permitted the courts to examine administrative measures of this type.
.The Committee considers that all these cases relating to trade union leaders in the banking and maritime sectors point to the existence of discretionary intervention on the part of the administrative authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions. The possibility open to the administrative authorities to remove trade unionists from office or to appoint trade unionists can leave the way open to all kinds of abuse and is consequently incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. The Committee has already pointed out in other cases that the removal from office of trade union leaders in case of breach of the law or of the by-laws of a union do not become enforceable except on the basis of a firm sentence on the part of the competent judicial authority or in any case after the period allowed for the submission of an appeal has elapsed without such an appeal having been made.
.The Committee considers that the Government should re-examine the measures taken with a view to the trade union leaders concerned being able to resume their trade union functions.
.The WFTU, in a telegram dated  May  points out that the authorities violently broke up a demonstration organised on  May. According to the WFTU  persons were arrested and treated violently on that occasion.
.It appears from the information gathered by the representative of the Director-General that the trade union leaders of a large number of trade union organisations who wished to celebrate  May , presented to the Ministry of the Interior one month in advance a request for authorisation to hold a public meeting in Santiago. The programme was to consist of a speech by a trade union leader and some artistic performances. On  April the organisation was notified that this meeting had not been authorised and that the only demonstration provided for in Santiago on this occasion would take place at the government buildings in the presence of the President of the Republic. All those interested were publicly invited to attend this demonstration in which numerous trade union leaders would participate.
.It was announced in the press that the organisers of the meeting which had not been authorised would turn up at the place chosen in order to inform those invited that the meeting had been",0,1975,Chile
196,"a lock-out which, because of its nature, timing or length, causes serious prejudice to health, supplies for the population, the national economy on national security, the President of the Republic may by decree order the resumption of work for a period of  days. The decree in question shall appoint a member of the corps of arbitration to act as mediator. In addition, article  of the Legislative Decree which amends article  of Law No.  on the security of the state, specifies that in the case of an illegal strike which causes serious prejudice to any industry that is vital to the national economy or occurs in any transport undertaking, in any farm on establishment which produce or process goods or articles essential to national defence or to supplies for the population or which provide public services or public utility services, the President of the Republic may order the resumption of work with the help of the civilian or military authorities. In these cases, the workers must return to work under conditions identical to those prevailing at the date of the illegal stoppage of work.
.In this respect, the Committee must stress in general terms the fact that measures of mobilisation or requisition of workers during a labour dispute lend themselves to abuse, and also the undesirability of recourse to such measures, except where they are taken in order to ensure the maintaining of essential services in circumstances of the utmost gravity.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that transitional article  provides for a staggering of times for returning to collective bargaining and the entry into force of the collective contracts which run, depending on the undertaking, from  August  to  June . The Committee would hope that the Government will continue to supply information on the practical application of the Legislative Decree as regards collective bargaining, particularly on the number of contracts concluded, on the number of workers covered, and on the undertakings involved.
.At its May  session, the Committee examined certain allegations made by the Latin American Central of Workers regarding the dismissal on  March  of Daniel Lillo, President of the National Association of Customs Employees of Valparaiso.
.The Committee had noted that this measure had been taken by the Regional Governor (Intendente) of the Valparaiso region in accordance with Legislative Decree No.  of . This Legislative Decree empowers intendentes and governors to demand the resignation of members of the executive Committees, amongst others, or workers' organisations in the public sector, on the ground that serious impediments prevent that organisation from functioning, and to appoint replacements. If the person concerned does not resign within the stated time limit, the intendente or governor issues a decree removing the person concerned from his position as a leader of the organisation. In the present case, the Government claims that Mr. Lillo had given to the Press a false account of a meeting which he had not attended. Moreover, the Committee noted that the Customs Administration was carrying out an administrative investigation into the case. Consequently, the Governing Body, while emphasising the importance of using judicial procedures in cases of dismissal of trade union leaders, urged the Government to supply information on the result of this investigation.
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that Mr. Lillo had been temporarily suspended from his employment. In this regard, the Committee must recall that one of the basic principles of freedom of association is that workers must enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, and that this protection is particularly desirable for trade union leaders. In fact, to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, the latter must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they held from their trade unions. Respect for this principle is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the right of organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom. The Committee would like the Government to indicate whether Legislative Decree No. , which is the basis for the measures taken against Mr. Lillo, has been repealed as far as workers' organisations in the public sector are concerned.
.Certain allegations have also been put forward by various complainant organisations regarding the dissolution by the Government in October  of seven trade union organisations. According to the Government, the conduct of the organisations thus dissolved showed that their methods of action and objectives coincided with the principles and aims of the Marxist doctrine. The organisations in question lodged a Constitutional appeal for protection before the Santiago Court of Appeal. Accordingly, the Governing Body had urged the Government to supply information on the results of these judicial proceedings, as well as information on the ultimate destination of the assets of the dissolved organisations.
.The Government states that the Appeal Court of Santiago dismissed the organisations concerned in the first instance. This decision was confirmed by a Supreme Court decree relating to four of these organisations. The matters involving the three other organisations are still taking place. The appeals for protection were rejected because the plaintiffs had requested the courts to declare Legislative Decree No.  inapplicable on the ground that it was unconstitutional. The Court could not pronounce on this issue because the appeal was for protection, whereas it ought to have been for inapplicability. The Government states that the parties concerned had the necessary time to present this latter form of appeal before the Supreme Court. Regarding the use of the assets of the dissolved organisations, the Government goes on to state that this question is under study and that it should be resolved to the benefit of the workers.
.The Committee notes that the Supreme Court rejected, on procedural grounds, the appeal brought before it by four of the dissolved organisations. The three other matters are still under way. In these circumstances, the Committee can only recall that occupational organisations must not be subject to measures of suspension or dissolution by administrative authority. The Committee is also of the opinion that the right to appeal is not always a sufficient guarantee. In fact it is important that judges can examine the case on its merits and study the reasons for the dissolution of an organisation. In addition, the Committee wishes to ask the Government to supply information on the outcome of the appeals still under way.
.In the various stages of the consideration of the case, the Committee has examined a number of allegations concerning the imprisonment and disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists. In a report examined by the Committee in November , the Government gave information concerning  out of the  persons mentioned in the list drawn up by the Committee in its th Report. In March , the Government pointed out that the Santiago Court of Appeal had delegated one of its judges to discharge the special mission of considering the cases of those persons who had presumably disappeared while on trial before one of the tribunals of the Santiago Court of Appeal district. These cases concerned  of the persons mentioned in the complaints. At its session of May , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, urged the Government to continue to forward information on the result of the pending proceedings and, in a general way, on the persons mentioned in the list drawn up by the Committee in its th Report.
.In its communication of  October , ICFTU states that  corpses bearing signs of torture have been discovered near the Yumbel cemetery. According to statements of the inhabitants of the area, the bodies had been buried at the end of October . A large deployment of military forces and police had been seen at the time in the surroundings. ICFTU states that two of the bodies have been identified as trade union leaders from the paper industry at Lafa.
.The Government states that proceedings are following their course before the Court of Appeal. Consequently, the Committee wishes to reiterate its request for information made in its last report. In addition, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet answered the new allegations.
.In their complaint of  September , the Professional Trade Union of Seafarers and the Port Employees' Trade Union alleged that the Intendente and the Governor of the Province of Concepcin issued two decrees, Nos.  and  of  and  September , which prevented the organisation of a trade union meeting for the purpose of designating the organising Committee of the ""Group for the defence of the rights of the workers of the Province of Concepcin"". According to the complainants, the authorities adopted these decrees on the basis of unsubstantiated allegations devoid of all legal foundation.
.Regarding these latter allegations, the Government states that the development of a free trade union movement requires the maintenance of public order so that the exercise of their rights is guaranteed to all citizens. According to the Government, this",0,1975,Chile
197,"dismissals of trade unionists in a number of undertakings, especially Hilanderia Andina SA, CTI Fensa Mademsa, the Copper Company of Chile (El Teniente division and Chuquicamata centre), the Latacen company, the Jorge Rivet Moulin company and the Chilean and North American Cultural Institute. Other communications recently received state that there have been dismissals of leaders of the public sector workers' organisations, in particular, the National Revenue Employees' Association (ANEF), the Association of Social Security Auxiliaries and trade unionists from the taxation department.
.From the information supplied by the Government in its communication of November  or in the documents handed to the mission, it appears that the dismissals at Hilandera Andina SA, CTI Fensa Mademsa and the Chilean and North American Cultural Institute were due to economic or financial reasons. In the last case, the workers filed an appeal with the courts.
.Regarding the dismissals at the Copper Company of Chile (El Teniente division), the Government stated that, following the appeal made by the workers, the labour court of Rancagua ordered the company to reinstate the dismissed workers or pay them compensation. The company opted for the second course. The labour court also gave a ruling in favour of the trade union leaders dismissed at the Chuquicamata centre and ordered their reinstatement. The company has complied with the court's decision and paid these leaders compensation corresponding to the period of dismissal. Three of the workers dismissed from the company Jorge Rivet Moulin filed an appeal with the courts which resulted in the payment of compensation. Concerning the dismissals of trade union leaders from the Latacen company, the Directorate of Labour informed the mission that the workers concerned, after an attempt at conciliation by the Labour Inspectorate had failed, filed an appeal with the labour court, which is now being examined.
.The mission had an opportunity to meet the trade union leaders of the National Revenue Employees' Association (ANEF) who had been dismissed. According to the trade unionists and, in particular, the President of ANEF, who had been removed from his functions within the National Directorate of industry and commerce, these measures were taken because of the trade union activities of the workers concerned. The Minister for Economic Affairs, on the other hand, asserted in a statement to the press that the dismissals were due to a reorganisation of the service in question.
.The Committee notes that some of the dismissals of trade unionists were due to economic or financial reasons. While the Committee is not competent to judge the advisability or not of dismissals of this nature, in the present instance it observes that there were court proceedings in several cases which resulted in compensation paid to the workers dismissed and even, in one case, to their reinstatement. The Committee therefore considers it appropriate to recall the importance of effective protection against dismissals on account of trade union activities and to point out that in cases of dismissals for economic reasons, measures discriminating against trade unions taken under this pretext should not be authorised.
.Regarding the dismissals of ANEF leaders, the Committee points out that the lack of legal recognition of the trade union rights of government employees, and the resulting lack of protection for trade union militants, can only encourage the adoption of measures prejudicial to the leaders of de facto organisations existing in this sector.
.In these circumstances, the Committee requests the Government to take measures to permit the reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists.
.At various stages in examining this case, the Committee has received allegations relating to the arrest and disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists. In March , the Government stated that the Santiago Court of Appeal had appointed one of its judges to hear the cases concerning persons presumed to have disappeared while on trial before tribunals in its jurisdiction. These cases concerned  of the persons mentioned in the complaints.
.More recently, complaints were lodged concerning action taken against various trade union leaders, the arrest of leaders of the National Federation of Metallurgical Unions (FENSIMET) and the placing under forced residence of persons arrested on May Day  and agricultural trade union leaders at Curic. Other allegations related to the arrest of Mr. Pedro Enriquez, former secretary for Youth of the CUT, on  November , and of Mr. Alvarez Seplveda, a metalworkers' leader, on  November .
.Lastly, communications from several complainant organisations (ICFTU, WFTU, CPUSTAL, UISM) dated January  have reported the arrest of Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzman, Chairman and Secretary-General of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Committee, respectively, whom the members of the mission had met while in Chile. They were arrested allegedly for having acted as representatives of an unregistered organisation.
.As regards the missing persons, the President of the Santiago Court of Appeal told the mission that the inquiry was going ahead and that the judge dealing with the case had not yet been able to take a final decision. In this connection, the mission was told that the amnesty law adopted by the Government in April  prevented action being taken against security officers who may have been involved in the disappearances and consequently the cases before the courts could not be concluded.
.According to the government authorities, the persons placed under house arrest following the celebration of May Day were activists who were not trade union leaders and who had created disturbances and provoked violence in the streets. Likewise, there were no trade union leaders among the seven persons living at Curic who had been placed under house arrest for disturbance of the peace. Only one of them had been engaged in trade union activities in .
.As regards the pending trials on which the Committee and Governing Body had requested information in May , the Government stated that the cases against Mr. Bobadilla, President of the National Federation of Textile Workers, and Mr. Guzman, President of the National Industrial Mining Federation, were dismissed and the dismissals confirmed by the Santiago Court of Appeal. Proceedings had been brought against these leaders for having acted as representatives of organisations without legal personality. The Government also stated that these trade union leaders had enjoyed complete freedom throughout the trial. Regarding Juan Jara, President of the Taxi Drivers' Trade Union, who had been accused, according to the complainants, of having organised a May Day demonstration, the Government stated that the Santiago Court of Appeal had suspended the prison sentence which was warranted by the elements contained in the dossier. Proceedings have now been brought against two other persons whom the complainants said had been arrested, Victor Muoz and Gustavo Poblete, the first for being in possession of false identity papers and the second for subversive activities. According to the Government, these two persons are not trade union leaders. Regarding the five leaders of the National Federation of Metallurgical unions whom the complainants alleged had been detained for three days and prosecuted, the Government stated that the persons in question were the subject of a complaint by the Ministry of the interior for having acted as representatives of other persons without the authorisation to do so. They were acquitted by the court of first instance, but given a suspended prison sentence by the Court of Appeal.
.As regards Mr. Pedro Enriquez, the Ministry of the Interior told the mission that this person had been arrested for engaging in activities against the security of the State, that the inquiry had established that he had used false identity papers, and that he had been placed at the disposal of the criminal judge in Santiago. Lastly, the mission was unable to obtain any information before leaving Chile concerning the arrest of Mr. Alvarez Seplveda. Since then, the Government has stated that the person referred to in the allegations, whose real name is Alvaro Seplveda, was released three days after his arrest. The Court of Appeal of Santiago, which had before it an appeal of habeas corpus in this connection, has been informed of the release of this person.
.As regards Mr. Alamiro Guzman and Manuel Bustos, the Government stated in its communication of  February  that the. Minister of the Interior, by virtue of the powers accorded to him under Legislative Decree No.  of , appealed to the Court of Appeal of Santiago against these persons for having acted as representatives of workers without the authorisation to do so through a legally non-existing body called ""the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body"". The investigating magistrate did not uphold the charges against these persons who were released on bail. The case is continuing before an ordinary civil judicial body which is independent of the executive authorities.
.The Committee notes, first of all, that no new elements have been produced in the cases pending before the courts concerning the missing trade unionists or former trade unionists. Furthermore, according to the information obtained by the mission from various sources, these cases could not be concluded because the amnesty law adopted by the Government in  did not allow proceedings to be brought against the security officers who",0,1975,Chile
198,"by depositing its by-laws, that trade unions can be dissolved only by court order, that there is no governmental control over trade union activities, that the election of new trade union leaders and the approval of trade union by-laws are made by secret ballot, and that workers have the possibility of choosing between organisations of different tendencies.
.The mission found, however, that the legislation was severely criticised at times, even in trade union circles which do not pursue a policy of systematic opposition to the Government. The workers' representatives - as, to a certain degree, the employers' representatives - stressed in particular that they had not been consulted about the trade union legislation or the labour policy.
.In the Committee's opinion, such an absence of dialogue - which the mission found far more marked than in  during the visit of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission - can only prejudice the interests of workers, the development of labour relations and social progress in general. The Committee thinks it useful here to refer to the Consultation (Industrial and National Levels) Recommendation,  (No. ), Paragraph  of which provides that measures should be taken to promote effective consultation and co-operation between public authorities and employers' and workers' organisations without discrimination of any kind against these organisations. In accordance with Paragraph  of the Recommendation, such consultation should aim at ensuring that the public authorities seek the views, advice and assistance of these organisations, particularly in the preparation and implementation of laws and regulations affecting their interests.
.The missions report reveals that the failure to consult the trade union organisations is only one aspect of the diminished role played by the national federations and Confederations in labour relations. Major obstacles are placed in the way of their establishment (requirement of at least  organisations for constituting a Confederation) or their survival (requirement for individual trade unions to renew their membership of federations every two years). Lastly and above all, under the new legislation federations and Confederations do not have the right either to bargain collectively or to call work stoppages. The trade union movement is thus deprived, at its highest level, of the rights essential for the protection of the workers' interests. Consequently, the trade unions engaged in collective bargaining - i.e. the plant unions - often find themselves at a disadvantage in negotiating with the management, especially as the right to strike is greatly limited by certain legislative provisions under which enterprises may recruit staff during the strike, as there is voluntary dismissal of workers if they do not recommence work within a period of  days, and because an excessive number of enterprises are deemed to be essential enterprises for which work stoppages are prohibited.
.The report also refers to other obstacles to the free operation of the trade unions which seriously limit their possibilities of effective action, such as the control exercised by the Directorate of Labour over trade union management and the requirement for a sworn official to be present at voting during trade union meetings.
.A large body of workers is not covered by some of the safeguards granted by the legislation. By reason of the legal impossibility of forming plant unions having less than  members, workers in small enterprises, for example, are not in a position to form trade unions for their specific activities and are therefore unable to join organisations having the right of collective bargaining. Lastly, workers in the public sector and in the maritime sector do not come within the scope of the trade union legislation. Specific regulations for these categories of workers are now under study.
.From a perusal of the missions report, the Committee has noted that the legislative provisions criticised most severely and most frequently by the trade union organisations are precisely those on which it had commented in November  when analysing the ""Labour Plan"". The Committee therefore considers that it would be necessary to amend the trade union legislation with a view to more effective application of the principles of freedom of association and hence of greater social justice.
.In these circumstances, it is regrettable that in the absence of the Minister of Labour, the findings arrived at by the mission could not be the subject of a true exchange of views with the government authorities and that they were unable to inform the mission whether such amendments or a change in government policy in the field of trade union rights could be contemplated in future. The Committee nevertheless trusts that the necessary legislative amendments will be introduced shortly in the light of the recommendations made by it. It would also like to be kept informed of any subsequent developments in this connection.
.Allegations were previously made regarding the dissolution by the Government of seven trade union organisations in October . According to the Government, the conduct of the dissolved organisations showed that their means of action and objectives coincided with the principles and aims of Marxist doctrine. The organisations in question had brought appeals to the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court, which dismissed them.
.In a document of the external Committee of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers, attached to the communications of the WFTU and the ICFTU, it was also mentioned that the Supreme Court had dissolved the trade union of the Santiago Union club on the ground that a trade union cannot exist in a non-profit making institution.
.More recent allegations related to the action taken by the authorities against the Unitary Workers' Front (FUT).
.During the mission talks were held with the leaders of several of the federations and Confederations dissolved in October. . Although these organisations continue to have a de facto existence, their leaders mentioned the great difficulties which they encounter in trying to keep them in operation.
.For its part, the Government stated in its communication of November  that the dissolution of the organisations in question was decided by law and not by administrative procedure. None of those organisations was engaged in labour activities. On the contrary, according to the Government, their activities were purely political and were carried on only by a few leaders. The government authorities also told the mission that the measures to dissolve those organisations were taken before the ""Labour Plan"" was promulgated and that dissolution of trade union organisations under the new legislation can be made only by judicial procedure. They also stressed that workers, including those who belonged to the dissolved trade unions, are entitled to form the organisations they wish, provided the law is observed.
.Regarding the dissolution of the trade union of the Santiago Union Club, the Government explained in its communication of November  that the employer had argued before the courts that the trade union established in , when the former Labour Code was still in force, had no legal existence. Under that Code, industrial trade unions could not be formed in non-profit making establishments. The Directorate of Labour, like the workers themselves, maintained on the contrary that the union had a legal existence. In the end, the court ruled in favour of the complainant and dissolved the organisation in February . The Government pointed out, however, that as of  October  no administrative action had yet been taken to strike the organisation from the trade union register and that the workers concerned could at all events form another trade union or transform the existing one in accordance - with the new legislation.
.The case for the Unitary Workers' Front was dismissed by the judge and confirmed by the Santiago Court of Appeal in October .
.The Committee takes note of the explanations supplied by the Government concerning the dissolution of seven federations and Confederations in October . It wishes to point out in this connection that dissolution of trade unions by the Executive in the exercise of legislative powers does not provide safeguards, any more than dissolution by administrative procedure for the rights of the defence. These rights can be guaranteed only by a normal judiciary procedure, which the Committee regards as indispensable. The Committee notes that under the new trade union legislation, workers' organisations can only be dissolved by judicial means. Concerning the liquidation of the funds and assets of the dissolved organisations, the Committee has been guided in cases of this kind by the criterion that, when an organisation is dissolved, its assets should eventually be distributed among its former members or handed over to the organisation that succeeds it. The Committee has also pointed out that the successor organisation should be understood to mean an organisation or organisations pursuing the aims for which the dissolved unions were established, and pursuing them in the same spirit.
.As regards the trade union of the Union Club, the Committee notes that it was dissolved by judiciary proceedings on the basis of the former provisions of the Labour Code and that the workers concerned may now form an organisation in accordance with the new legislation.
.Various complaints, which were either mentioned in the Committee's nd Report or received since then, referred to",0,1975,Chile
199,"a large number of federations or Confederations which represent workers from different sectors of activity and of which the leaders of the CNS are, for the most part, also leaders.
.If it is true that the CNS does not possess legal personality - in that it appears that this organisation never requested it - the Committee must however recall that, when it examined the new trade union legislation, it had pointed out that a certain number of provisions relating to federations and Confederations were incompatible with the principles of freedom of association, in particular as regards the setting up of these organisations. The Committee is of the opinion that these restrictions imposed on the creation and activities of Confederations might be able to explain, at least to a certain extent, why the CNS has apparently not requested legal personality. In addition, the Committee notes that a number of organisations which take part in the activities of the CNS do have legal personality. The Committee also recalls that the CNS-represents - as the ILO mission which was sent to Chile in December  was able to note - a body which co-ordinates different workers' organisations belonging to various sectors of activity.
.As regards the allegations that the Government refused to meet with the CNS leaders, the Committee must stress the importance, for the maintenance of a country's social harmony, of regular consultations with employers' and workers' representatives; as regards the trade union sphere such contacts should embrace the whole spectrum of trade union activity, irrespective of the philosophical or political beliefs of its leaders.
.The Committee notes that only the two trade unionists holding the principal executive function at the CNS, namely Manuel Bustos, chairman and Alamiro Guzmn, secretary-general, are still being detained at the present time. It points out that the proceedings taken against these two persons are of a particularly serious nature since the accused had already been found guilty of having represented workers without having the legal capacity to do so in an earlier trial and that their sentence could not this time be suspended. The Committee understands that the judicial proceedings in this matter are following their course. It therefore requests the Government to provide information on the results of these legal proceedings.
.As regards the other allegations which have been made by the complainants since the last examination of the case (arrest of two persons in March  and expulsion of four lawyers), the Committee takes note of the denial by the Government of the complainants' statements concerning the anti-trade union nature of the alleged facts.
.Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not provided information on the allegations made by the WFTU concerning the dismissal of workers in the Panal Textile Undertaking.
.The last time the Committee examined this case was at its May  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have sent the ILO the following communications: the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) (communications dated  May,  and  June,  July and  November  and  January ); the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) (communications dated  and  June ); the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) (a communication dated  June ); the International Federation of Teachers' Unions (IFTU) (a communication of  June ); the Miners' Trade Unions International (UISM) (communications dated  June  and  January ); the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) (communications dated  October and  and  November  and  and  January and  February ); the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees (a communication dated  November ); the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) (a communication dated  January ); and the ""Group of Ten"" ( February ).
.For its part, the Government forwarded observations in communications dated  October , the month of November  and  and  February .
.Also, when the Governing Body discussed the nd Report of the Committee on Freedom of Association in May , the Workers' group requested that a high-level mission be sent to Chile to examine the trade union situation. Following contacts and correspondence exchanged with the Government, the Director-General appointed Mr. Nicolas Valticos, Assistant Director-General, Adviser for International Labour Standards, Mr. Manuel Araoz, Chief of the Freedom of Association Branch, and Mr. Bernard Gernigon, official in the same branch, to carry out that mission, which took place from  to  December .
.Before the mission left for Santiago, contacts had been made with the Permanent Delegation of Chile in Geneva to arrange for it to meet various government authorities, in particular the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Justice. On its arrival in Santiago the mission was handed a work programme where interviews with the Ministers of Labour and Justice, among others, were scheduled. In the end, the Minister of Labour, Mr. Jose Piera, sent his apologies for being unable to receive the members of the mission and was represented by Mr. L.A. Camus, Undersecretary of State for Labour. The mission also met Messrs. Enrique Montero, Under-Secretary of State for the Interior; Lautaro Prez Ruiz, Deputy Under-Secretary of State for Justice; Ramn Surez, Director of Labour; Jaime Lagos, Director of Bilateral Policy at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; and Leonel Beraud, President of the Court of Appeal of Santiago.
.The mission also had talks with the President of the Confederation of Manufacturing and Commerce at the headquarters of this central employers' organisation, and with officials of affiliated organisations, namely the National Chamber of Commerce, the National Mining Company, the Association of Banks and Financial Institutions, the National Agricultural Society, the Chilean Chamber of Building and the Industrial Development Association.
.As concerns workers' organisations, the mission met the leaders of many legally recognised or de facto organisations belonging to all trade union tendencies and covering many branches of activity: a group of trade unionists who were supporters of leaders in the copper, leather and footwear, banking, coal mining, saltpetre, maritime and electricity sectors; the Chilean Confederation of Employees in the Private Sector (CEPCH); the ""Group of Ten"", which included representatives of workers in the civil service, agriculture, copper mining, postal services, the maritime sector, the iron and steel industry, metalworking, plastics, the railways and social security; the National Trade Union Confederation of Agricultural Workers; Peasant Workers' Unity (an organisation which had been dissolved in October ); the National Confederation of copper workers; the ""National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body"", which included in particular representatives of workers in agriculture, metalworking, building, mining, coal mining and textiles; the Workers' Unitary Front, whose delegation comprised leaders from the textile, ports, teaching, municipal employees', plastics and public works sectors; the Confederation of Unions of Workers in Metalworking, Mining and Assimilated Branches. Over  trade union leaders took part in some of these meetings, most of which were held on trade union premises. The mission also spoke to representatives of the Association of Relatives of Persons Who Are under Arrest or Who Have Disappeared. It also had private talks with persons knowledgeable in social affairs.
.In addition to these meetings the mission visited the Operations Centre of the El Teniente Copper Mines, where it had talks with the management of the undertaking and the trade unions on working conditions and industrial relations and on certain allegations pending before the Committee on Freedom of Association.
.All the information collected on the spot was the subject of a detailed mission report, which the Committee fully took into account when examining the allegations before it.
.On  June  the Government promulgated several legislative decrees on trade union rights and the right to collective bargaining, in particular Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  known as the ""Labour Plan"". Subsequently, certain technical amendments were made to these texts, particularly in November  and May . At its November  and May  Sessions, the Committee noted that this legislation was an important step forward and made a number of comments on these texts, especially on the following points: formation of trade unions, procedure for acquiring legal personality, trade union by-laws, elections of trade union leaders, inspection of trade union accounts, prohibition to intervene in partisan political activities, formation of federations and Confederations, trade union rights of public officials, scope and level of collective bargaining, and the right to strike.
.The mission's report indicates that the new legislation is an improvement over the previous situation where, under Legislative Decree No.  adopted in December  immediately after the change of regime, the right to hold trade union elections, the right of collective bargaining and the right to strike had been suspended and the right to hold meetings seriously restricted. Both the Government representatives and the employers' representatives stressed the advance which this legislation represented from the standpoint of freedom of association. It was pointed out that a trade union organisation may acquire legal personality merely",0,1975,Chile
200,"The national executive of the CNS was instructed to present the register of demands to the governmental authorities. The main demands concerned legislation on work contracts, the recognition of greater freedom of association, the extension of collective bargaining, wage adjustments, social security reform and housing.
.The CNS requested an interview with the Minister of Labour on  June in order to deliver the register of demands, but the request was refused. The register was therefore sent to him by post. The minister of the Interior then instituted legal proceedings against  national trade union leaders, all members of the CNS executive. These trade unionists were accused of arrogating the right of representing workers without being legally qualified to assume such functions and of political proselytism and militancy. Under the provisions of Legislative Decree No. , the first of these charges is punishable by prison sentences running from  days to  years and under the National Security Act, the second charge is punishable by imprisonment and exile. The Minister of the Interior also made use of the power conferred on him by the new Constitution to request the Constitutional court to apply the provisions of article  of the Constitution concerning acts of totalitarism and terrorism. The Constitutional court must decide as a matter of conscience whether the accused are guilty or innocent and what penalties should be imposed. Furthermore, according to the CNS, the authorities summoned each of the trade unions which had signed the register of demands and threatened to dissolve them if they did not withdraw their signatures.
.On Tuesday,  July, all the trade union leaders against whom proceedings had been instigated were summoned to appear before the examining magistrate. They were immediately arrested and transferred to the Santiago public prison. Only Juan Manuel Seplveda, the CNS officer in charge of international relations escaped this fate since he was on a trade union mission in Europe. The CNS points out that its chairman Manuel Bustos and secretary-general Alamiro Guzmn had already been prosecuted by the Ministry of the Interior for the same offence and had been given a suspended sentence of  days of imprisonment by the Court of First Instance; as a consequence, they will now have to serve the sentence without any possibility of a new suspension being granted. The ICFTU subsequently informed the ILO of the release of eight of the CNS leaders so that only Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn are still being detained.
.In a telegram dated  August , the ICFTU reported the expulsion to Argentina of Chilean lawyers who had agreed to defend the accused trade union leaders before the courts.
.The Government points out that technical amendments were made to legislation respecting trade union organisations with a view to bringing the texts into line with the country's political Constitution, approved in a referendum held in September . It adds that the advisability or otherwise of introducing new amendments to national legislation is a matter exclusively within its sovereign rights, in accordance with its policy and the national interest. The Government states that employers' and workers' organisations were consulted on a permanent basis during the preparation of the respective bills.
.As regards the judicial proceedings concerning the trade unionists who have disappeared, the Government states once again that these cases are being investigated and fall within the competence of the ordinary judicial authorities. The Government will transmit any new information of interest to the Committee.
.As regards the initial legal proceedings taken against Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn in January , the Government points out that the examining magistrate issued his findings at the beginning of April and that in June the accused were given a suspended sentence of  days imprisonment. The accused appealed to the Court of Appeal which upheld the original sentence. The defence counsel then lodged a new appeal, known as a ""complaints appeal"", with the Supreme Court. The latter, in a judgement delivered in August , also upheld the original verdict.
.The allegations made in connection with the arrest of two trade unionists, Luis Vergara and Carlos Gonzales, are, according to the Government, unfounded. It explains that there is no trace of their having been arrested and that these persons are not known in the sectors of activity mentioned by the complainants since the organisations of which they are said to be leaders enjoy no legal or de facto existence.
.As regards the proceedings taken against the leaders of the CNS, the Government states, on the basis of the relevant texts in force, that Chilean law guarantees all citizens full freedom of association, and that they may freely establish, join or withdraw from trade union organisations. Furthermore, under section  of Legislative Decree No.  of , associations or groups of persons which represent workers without having the legal capacity to do so are declared contrary to the public order and the national security. According to the Government, this provision protects the activity of legitimately elected leaders, since otherwise it would be impossible for workers to distinguish between legally established organisations and de facto organisations which are established and dissolved without statutes and in accordance with interests not shared by the workers.
.The Government continues that, despite the clarity of these provisions, a group of former militants from dissolved political parties set itself up as the leader of an organisation, called the National Trade Onion Co-ordinating Body, established completely outside the law. This group, claiming to represent all Chilean workers, addressed a document called ""register of national demands"" to the President of the Republic which practically requested the repeal of trade union legislation. The offence committed was not the fact of having presented a request to the head of State, but rather that the group had assumed the status of workers' representative without being trade union leaders. The Government states that the legally established organisations have moreover publicly denied their alleged affiliation to the CNS.
.The Government explains that the sole purpose of the proceedings which were instituted against the leaders of this organisation was therefore to protect the trade union activity and freedom of legally established organisations. It also points out that the legitimately elected trade union leaders of legally existing organisations have the right to present petitions. The President of the Republic frequently meets with such leaders without such contacts leading to court proceedings against the trade unionists.
.The judicial authorities were therefore requested to examine whether the action of the CNS leaders constituted an offence or not. An examining magistrate was appointed and found grounds for a charge against the CNS leaders of illegally assuming the representation of workers. The defence requested the magistrate and subsequently the Appeals Court and the Supreme Court to annul the indictment and to release the persons concerned on bail. These two requests were refused. Subsequently, during the trial, bail was granted to the accused with the exception of Messrs. Guzmn and Bustos since under the Penal Code, persons who have been previously given suspended sentences of imprisonment are not entitled to bail. The Government points out however, that the persons concerned may request their temporary release as many times as they wish.
.As regards the allegations concerning the expulsion of four lawyers from the country, the Government points out that these persons - whose names it gives - were not the defence counsel of the CNS leaders, but were militant members of suspended political parties. Three of them had exercised ministerial functions in previous governments. One is in Venezuela, one in Spain and two in Mexico.
.In conclusion, the Government states that it has provided this information as a demonstration of its desire to cooperate with the ILO, but that it does not accept that it should be judged on the basis of complaints which are designed to complicate and prolong indefinitely the Chilean case before the ILO.
.The Committee notes that technical adjustments have been made to the trade union legislation. However, these amendments are not such as to warrant any modification of the comments made in its previous report. It therefore requests the Government to continue to keep it informed of any subsequent developments in this matter.
.The Committee also notes that inquiries are continuing into the disappearance of trade unionists. It would like to be kept informed of the results of the judicial inquiries now under way.
.As regards the matters involving the leaders the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body, the Committee notes that the leaders in question have been prosecuted for having acted as representatives of the workers without having the legal capacity to do so, since they are the leaders of a de facto organisation which does not enjoy legal personality. The Committee must, however, point out that the origin of the present case is certainly one which concerns freedom of association because the proceedings were instituted after a register of demands of a clearly social and occupational nature had been presented by the leaders concerned. Furthermore, this register had been drawn up in accordance with a decision taken at a meeting which was attended by",0,1975,Chile
201,"presented an appeal for wrongful dismissal to the labour authorities: one received compensation equivalent to US$, and the other dropped his appeal. Of the  dismissed workers,  belong to trade union No. ,  to trade union No.  and one is not a member of any organisation. According to the Government, it appears from this information that there was no anti-union victimisation at the enterprise.
.As regards the ICFTU allegations concerning the arrest of Messrs. Eugenio Diaz, Sergio Aguilo and Germn Molina, the Government points out that it is incorrect to state that the first two were arrested for being the legal advisers of the CNS, since other people were the group's lawyers. The three persons concerned are leaders of a dissolved political party and were arrested and prosecuted for offences relating to Legislative Decree No.  of  October  which declares various political parties illegal and dissolved, and to the law on state security and the control of arms. According to the Government, their arrest accordingly has nothing to do with trade union reasons since none of them was a trade union leader or engaged in trade union activities. The Government states that these persons have been free since  April  in accordance with a Supreme Court order.
.In its telegram of  May , the ICFTU alleges that the Chilean Appeal Court has sentenced to  days' imprisonment the CNS leaders Manuel Bustos, Alamiro Guzmn, Sergio Freyhofer, Germn Jofre, Luis Suarez, Jos Verasay, Manuel Jimnez, Humberto Vergara, Arturo Martinez and Carlos Apazo. The Appeal Court based its decision on the violation of Legislative Decree No. . The sentenced trade union leaders have lodged an appeal before the Supreme Court of Chile. If the appeal fails, Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn will be imprisoned until they have completed the above-mentioned sentence.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government on the prosecution of the two leaders of the CNS, Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn, and in particular that they are no longer imprisoned. However, since - according to the new allegations - the Chilean Court of Appeal has sentenced not only Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn, but also  other CNS leaders, to  days' imprisonment for the violation of legislative Decree No.  concerning trade union representation and since the sentenced leaders will be forced to complete their sentence if their appeal before the Supreme Court fails, the Committee would stress that the adoption of measures of detention and sentencing against workers' representatives in connection with activities related to the protection of the workers' interests endangers the free exercise of trade union rights. Noting that appeal proceedings are still under way the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the matter.
.Concerning the dismissals of workers from the Panal undertaking, while noting the Government's explanations on the nature of the reasons for the dismissals in question, the Committee must note that these measures came very shortly after action had been undertaken by the trade union organisations of the undertaking in support of their claims, and in particular after a fairly protracted strike. In these circumstances the Committee cannot but establish a link between the labour disputes involving the trade unions and the management of the undertaking and the dismissals which were subsequently announced. In this respect the Committee must point out that when trade union members and leaders are dismissed for having exercised their right to strike, which is one of the essential means whereby workers and workers' organisations can promote and defend their interests, there is reason to conclude that they have been penalised for their trade union activities and are subject to anti-union discrimination, contrary to the principle of freedom of association. Consequently, the Committee would recall that workers must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of anti-union discrimination both in law and in practice.
.As regards the new allegations concerning measures of arrest taken in respect of three persons in December , the Committee must note that the fact that the persons concerned are trade union leaders has not been established by the complainants, any more than the connections between trade union activity and the measures of arrest. While regretting these measures which affect persons, one of whom seems to have been engaged in promoting and defending human rights, the Committee considers that these allegations do not come within its terms of reference. Moreover, it notes that they have been released.
.Finally, the Committee recalls that it wishes to be kept informed of developments in the area of trade union legislation and of the outcome of the judicial proceedings concerning the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes that Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzman are no longer imprisoned. However, since the new allegations state that they have been sentenced - along with  other CNS leaders - by the Court of Appeal to  days' imprisonment and since they will be forced to complete their sentence if their appeal before the Supreme Court fails, the Committee stresses that the adoption of measures of detention and sentencing against workers' representatives in connection with activities related to the protection of the workers' interests endangers the free exercise of trade union rights. Noting that appeal proceedings are under way, the Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the matter.(b) Regarding the dismissals of workers at the Panal undertaking, the Committee cannot but establish a connection between the labour disputes involving the trade unions and the management of the undertaking and the subsequent dismissals. It reminds the Government that workers must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of anti-union discrimination both in law and in practice.(c) As regards the arrest of three persons in December , the Committee considers that these allegations do not come within its terms of reference and that consequently this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.(d) The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments in the matter of trade union legislation.(e) The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the results of the judicial proceedings under way concerning the disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists.
.The Committee has examined this case on several occasions and in particular at its February  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have sent the ILO the following communications: the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) (communications dated  March,  May,  and  July ); the Trades Union International of Workers in the Metal Industry ( June ); the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) (, ,  and  July ,  August ); National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS) (,  and  July ); the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) ( July ); the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) ( July ); the International Federation of Teachers' Unions (IFTU) ( July ); the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees ( July ).
.For its part, the Government forwarded observations in a letter dated  September .
.At its session in February , the Committee had adopted interim conclusions on one of the aspects of the case, namely the arrest of two trade union leaders: Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn, chairman and secretary-general respectively of the CNS. The Committee had requested the Government to inform it of the results of the legal proceedings taken against these two persons.
.Furthermore, the Committee had asked to be kept informed of any subsequent developments concerning two other aspects of the case: the inquiries undertaken into the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists and trade union legislation.
.In its communication of  March , the WFTU alleges the arrest on  March of Luis Vergara, President of the Glass Federation and Carlos Gonzales, leader of the Coal Federation.
.The WFTU includes with its communication of  May  a report of the external Committee of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean workers. In addition to allegations already examined by the Committee, the report refers to the situation of  workers who were allegedly dismissed from the Panal Textile Undertaking because of their trade union activities during a lawful strike lasting  days which had been organised in this undertaking.
.The other communications from the complainants concern the arrest of ten leaders of the National Trade Union Co-ordinating Body (CNS). This organisation explains in particular in a communication dated  July , that in accordance with requests made by trade union leaders in November  at the organisation's national advisory meeting, the CNS has drawn up a list of demands, now referred to as the ""register of national demands"", which was approved by  trade union organisations and , leaders who represented, according to the complainant organisation, , workers.",0,1975,Chile
202,"suspended. The police intervened to break up the meeting of the persons who had gathered. As regards this matter the Secretary of State for the Interior pointed out that a minimum principle of authority necessitated an intervention in a reunion which had not been authorised. He also emphasised that the police had acted moderately and in a correct manner. Some  people, amongst whom was the trade union leader for the railway sector, Ernesto Vogel, were arrested for an identity and residence check. They were all released the same day without having been interrogated even if some of them are being charged before the local police court for breach of the peace in addition, some of the demonstrators held a meeting in a church whence they withdrew peacefully without any intervention on the part of the police. The leaders of  trade union organisations issued a tract to the workers in which they examined various aspects of the social and trade union situation and in which it is indicated that authorisation to hold a meeting on the occasion of  May had been refused for the fifth year running.
.The Committee notes that the persons arrested on the occasion of the demonstration organised on  May were immediately released. It must however express its regret at the fact that the Government did not authorise a meeting requested by a large number of trade union leaders. In fact, as the Committee has already indicated as regards the prohibition of a meeting which certain trade union organisations wished to organise on  May , trade unions should have the right to freely organise meetings which they wish on the occasion of Labour Day provided that they respect the measures taken by the authorities to ensure public order.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the detention or the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists:(i) to regret that the information provided by the Government does not permit it to note that any progress has been made as to the supply of information on the persons in question and to request the Government to continue its investigations in order that these persons might be traced;(ii) to request the Government to transmit information on the results of the judicial proceedings that are taking place regarding these persons;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the transfer of some trade unionists, to note that all the trade unionists concerned have regained their freedom, and to decide that no purpose would be served in pursuing further its examination of this aspect of the case;(c) as regards the allegations concerning the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from trade union leaders in exile, to suggest to the Government that it should, in the spirit of the amnesty that has recently been decreed, re-examine the measure which affects Mr. Meneses and Mr. Araneda;(d) as regards the allegations concerning the measures affecting certain trade union leaders:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  concerning the obligation on trade union leaders to belong to the occupation represented by their organisation and the removal from office of trade union leaders by administrative authority;(ii) to request the Government to intervene with a view to the reinstatement of those concerned in their trade union functions and, in the case of dismissal, in their employment;(iii) to request the Government to transmit the text of the judgement to be handed down in the case of Mr. Juan Fincheira, Mr. Milton Paga, Mr. Carlos Arellano and Mr. Arturo Latuz.(e) with regard to the allegations concerning the events which took place on  May, to note that the persons arrested have been released, but to express its regret that the Government did not authorise a meeting requested by a large number of trade union leaders, and to stress that trade unions should have the right to freely hold meetings which they wish on the occasion of Labour Day provided that they respect public order;(f) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee examined this case in February, May and November  and in February, May and November . It submitted an interim report at each of these sessions.
.Since it last examined the case the Committee has received a number of communications from complainant organisations: one (dated  November ) from the World Federation of Trade Unions, three (dated  November and  December  and  January ) from the World Confederation of Labour, one (dated  November ) from the Industrial Federation of Building, Wood and Building Materials Workers (FIEMC), one (dated  November ) from the National Federation of Metalworkers' Unions (FENSIMET), one (dated  December ) from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), and one (dated  December ) from the Trade unions international of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries (UIBWM).
.These allegations were transmitted to the Government as and when they were received. The Government has supplied information in letters dated  December ,  and  January and  February .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In reply to the allegations made earlier, the Government had supplied certain information, and had stated on several occasions that nobody was or had been under arrest on account of his status as a trade unionist or his trade union activities, but for breaches of the law or for reasons of public order.
.In November  the Committee noted with deep regret that the Government had not supplied any new information concerning the alleged arrest or disappearance of the many persons named in the complaints. The Committee had, however, been informed that following the submission of new evidence to substantiate the claim that these persons had been arrested, the Supreme Court had decided to reopen the inquiry into, in particular, the disappearance of  serving or former trade union officials named in these complaints.
.The Committee expressed the hope that the investigations would be carried out diligently and in full independence. More generally, as concerns all the allegations of disappearances, the Committee urged the Government to carry out thorough inquiries into these cases, in respect of most of which the complainants had supplied additional information, including eye-witness accounts, to substantiate their claim that the persons in question had been arrested.
.The Committee further noted with regret that the recommendations for the continuance of the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn did not appear to have been complied with. The Committee considered that the witnesses' testimony compiled by the Ad Hoc Working Group established by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the organization of American States sufficed to show the need for reopening the inquiry into this matter and continuing it until the person or persons responsible were found.
.The Government had likewise failed to reply to the allegations concerning the temporary arrest of certain trade union officials: Samuel Astorga, Eduardo Berros Morales and Ramn Velasquez.
.On the Committee's recommendation, the Governing Body, inter alia, requested the Government to supply information on the situation of the persons named in the list annexed to the th Report. It requested that the competent authorities continue the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, and asked the Government to forward as speedily as possible its comments on the arrest of the persons named in paragraph  above.
.The FENSIMET subsequently alleged, in its letter of  November , that the caretaker of its union headquarters, Juan Montecinos Montecinos, had been kept in custody for six hours. The persons who arrested him had produced no warrant for his arrest, and he had allegedly been severely tortured. The complainant organisation had filed a protest with the Ministry of the Interior; an inquiry had been ordered, but it had not yet been discovered who was responsible for the torturing.
.As concerns the persons alleged to have disappeared, the Government stated in its letter of  January  that the Ministry of Labour and Social welfare had set up, jointly with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a co-ordination Committee for the collation of evidence, since most of the names mentioned also appeared in similar complaints filed with other international organisations. All the available information would be sent with the report requested for  April .
.With regard to the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, the Government repeated that the Valparaiso courts had undertaken an inquiry and had adjourned the case on  February , in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure. No new evidence had come to light and the case had not been reopened.
.The Government denied that Samuel Astorga, Eduardo Berros and Ramn Velasquez had ever been arrested; the first named was not and",0,1975,Chile
203,"of the ILO;(c) to note with interest the Government's announcement of a return shortly to collective bargaining and to draw its attention to the principles and considerations set out in paragraph  above concerning the right to strike;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set out in paragraphs - above concerning trade union organisations in the agricultural sector and to invite it, in particular, to adopt appropriate measures to facilitate the financing of federations and Confederations in this sector;(e) to note the information concerning the situation of FENATEX and FIEMC and to request the Government once again to provide information on the possible presence of a representative of the Ministry of Education on the Executive Committee of ANESE,(f) to note with interest the measures taken by the Government, especially as regards the amnesty, and to express the hope that other measures will be adopted, as soon as possible, in order to fully re-establish the exercise of civil rights, thus permitting the return to a normal trade union situation;(g) to request the Government to continue to send information on the evolution of the trade union situation as regards the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation commission and to transmit a report thereon by  October .
.The Committee last examined this case at its February  session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since it last examined the case the Committee has received communications from the World Federation of Trade Unions ( March ), the Latin American Central of Workers ( April ) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( April ). The Government, for its part, sent information in a communication dated  March .
.In addition, during his direct contacts mission to Chile, Mr. Segovia, the representative of the Director-General, obtained information on the various matters still outstanding in the present case.
.In February  the Committee expressed its regret that the Government's recent communications contained no information with respect to the many persons named by the complainants as having been arrested or as having disappeared, whereas the Committee had hoped to obtain particulars, inter alia, as to the results of the further investigations undertaken by the Supreme Court into the disappearance of  serving or former trade union officials. The Government had stated, however, that it would supply all the available information by  April . On the Committee's recommendation, the Governing Body, accordingly, urged the Government to supply particulars of the inquiries made into the situation of the persons named in a list drawn up by the Committee.
.As concerns three persons who, according to the WFTU, had been temporarily arrested (Samuel Astorga, Eduardo Berros and Ramn Velasquez), the Government had denied the allegations made and declared that these persons had never been arrested. The Governing Body decided, in March , to bring the Government's reply to the attention of the complainants. Lastly, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to forward its observations concerning the arrest of Juan Montecinos, the caretaker at the headquarters of the National Federation of Metalworkers' Unions, who was alleged to have been kept in custody for six hours and severely tortured.
.In its communication of  March , the Government again states that in cases where trade unionists have been arrested, this was not due to their trade union activities but because of their involvement in partisan agitation, sometimes under cover of so-called trade union action.
.With regard to the persons who are said to have disappeared, the Government states that the law courts are now dealing with the actions brought in this connection. The procedure is in two stages: the preliminary investigation, which is conducted in private, and the court proceedings, when judgement is pronounced. The courts, which are quite independent from the Government, may not divulge what was revealed in confidence during the preliminary investigation until the case is closed either by a final judgement or by the dismissal of the case. Proceedings have been initiated in respect of each of the actions brought. In a large number of cases it has been established that many of the persons concerned were at home, some of them not even aware that they had been reported missing. Other persons presumed missing had been arrested under the State Security Act and then released, whereupon they returned to work. Another group is now abroad, and one person is in prison for fraud and bigamy. A number of persons have been found to have several aliases and identity documents. Some are not registered with the Identity Bureau.
.With regard to the complaints presented to the ILO, the Government states that, of the  cases mentioned over all these years, explanations have been given by the Government in  of them showing clearly the falseness of the accusations made. Before the change of regime, between  and  persons disappeared every year. According to United Nations statistics, the yearly figures for missing persons run into thousands in certain countries. The Government claims that it has always offered the fullest collaboration in the investigations undertaken. It mentions three factors which should not be overlooked in an impartial analysis of this question. Under the former regime, identity papers were forged on a vast scale for political and electoral purposes, so that many of the persons reported missing never really existed. Following the change of regime, numerous operations were carried out with a view to preventing the spread of hotbeds of internal subversion. These clashes resulted in the disappearance of certain persons. The Government remarks, in this connection, that the number of reports of missing persons is declining steadily and rapidly in so far as it, has become possible to restore order and security in the country. Lastly, in the Government's opinion, it is no exaggeration to assume that, in the campaign being waged against Chile, recourse may be had to the invention of further disappearances in order to keep the debate on Chile in the limelight.
.The Government has not supplied information concerning the arrest of Juan Martecinos, caretaker of the local trade union branch of the FENSIMET.
.During the direct contacts mission information was published in the press concerning the arrest of persons who were said to have committed crimes against the legislation on internal security, but in the course of the interviews with the trade union leaders of various trends no mention was made to the representative of the Director-General of actual or recent cases of arrest for trade union activities except for those which had taken place during the events of  May which are examined later in this present document.
.As regards the list of persons in respect of whom the Committee had requested information in its th Report, the Government supplied the following details to the representative of the Director-General. The person appearing in this list under the name of Pedro Abel Barria A. was probably Pedro Felix Argel Vera who was detained in Chin Chin Prison and who was amnestied by Decree Law No.  of  April .The Government has no information in respect of the following persons: Jos Bacza Cruces, Jorge Caceres Gonzalez, Gabriel Castillo Tapia, Carlos Contreras Maleye, Jose Corvalan Valencia, Juan Cortez Abruiz, Lenin Diaz Silva, Humberto Fuentes Rodriguez, Mario Fuica Vega, Maria Gutierrez Ramirez, Joel Huaniquir Penairdes, Fernando Lara Rojas, Victor Macaya Molina, Guillermo Martinez Quijon, Bario Miranda Godoy, Juan Moraga Garces, Miguel Morales Ramirez, Miguel Nazal Quiroz, Rodolfo Nunez Benairdes, Juan Orellana Catalan, Luis Recabarren Gonzalez, Manuel Recabarren Rojas, Anabal Ripeulme Pino, Jorge Salgado Salinas, Pedro Silva Busto, Jorge Solovera Garrado, Luis Vega Ramirez, Carlos Vizcarra Cofre, Jose Weibel Navarrette and Ricardo Weibel. As for the other cases, the Government refers to the information supplied to the ILO in its communication.
.As regards one of the procedures that had been set in motion concerning the disappearance of a number of persons, the Minister of Justice pointed out that the judge of the Court of Appeal of Santiago, who had been appointed to deal with this matter, went to the customs office known as ""Abanzada de los Libertadores"" at the frontier between Chile and Argentina where he was able to confirm from the records that Horacio Cepeda Marinkovic and Luis Lazo Santander had crossed over to Argentina on  January , that Lisandro Cruz Diaz had done likewise on  January  and that Lincoyan Berrios Cataldo had also done so on  December . According to this information the departure from the country of these persons did not meet with any obstacles since no action on the part of the Government or of the courts prevented them from going abroad and in order to cross this frontier an identity card was all that was necessary.
.It was pointed out to the representative of the Director-General that the courts were dealing with a number of habeas corpus applications concerning persons who had disappeared. There was a certain doubt as to the effect which the measure of amnesty decreed by the Government could have on the subsequent",0,1975,Chile
204,"the company gave the  workers who had ceased to work on  August  the option of being reinstated in their jobs or being appropriately indemnified. The same was agreed with respect to a further  of the workers. Those workers who opted for reinstatement were to receive , pesos as compensation in respect of arrears of pay. The  workers who were not included in this arrangement were to be fully indemnified and their arrears of pay calculated as at  August . According to the Government, the company agreed to the creation of  other posts in addition to those available and those which were to be vacated by the workers indemnified under the terms of the agreement. All of these posts would be filled with temporary workers in order of their seniority with the company.
.The Government added that, on  October , the above agreement was approved by the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Labour Law. The National Union of Workers in the Iron, Steel and Allied Products Industry withdrew its claim and the proceedings had therefore been considered as finally settled.
.The Committee notes from the information at its disposal that the complaint concerns the action taken by the Spicer company against the workers of that company when they attempted to withdraw from the Federation of Workers' Groups and establish a union of their own choice, whose registration and application for affiliation with a national union were refused by the labour authorities for reasons which are not stated. The threats and pressure alleged to have been exerted by the company against the workers and the eventual dismissal of some  are not denied by the Government which describes the manner in which the matter has been settled following conciliation by the Secretariat of Labour and Social Welfare. As regards the allegation that a union leader named Moiss Escamilla was detained, the Government has supplied no information in reply.
.The Committee has emphasised the importance it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Mexico, that workers and employers should, in actual practice, be able to form and join organisations of their own choosing in full freedom. The Committee has also expressed the view that governments should take measures, whenever necessary, to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination against workers in respect of their employment.
.The Committee notes that the company in question proceeded to dismiss a large number of the workers following their participation in strike action which was engaged as a protest over the company's attitude to the formation of an independent union. During the strike the company concluded a new collective agreement with a separate union, without any of the workers being consulted on the matter.
.The Committee considers that the events as described by the complainants tend to show that the attitude and measures adopted by the company, including the dismissals, resulted in the commission of acts of anti-union discrimination which were motivated by the exercise of the workers' right to organise and action taken by them to defend this right.
.The Committee notes that the conciliatory intervention of the labour authorities made it possible to conclude an agreement under which most of the workers who had been dismissed were given the opportunity of being reinstated. However, more than  workers, although indemnified, lost their jobs.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to ask the Government to examine what measures could be taken in order to provide fuller protection to workers against acts of anti-union discrimination and interference in the establishment of their organisations;(b) to request the Government to supply information on the present position of Mr. Moiss Escamilla, who is alleged to have been detained;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested in subparagraph (b).Geneva,  February  (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1975,Mexico
205,".The Committee last considered this case in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ).
.The Government sent further information by a communication of  January .
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but not the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint related firstly to the dismissal of workers in a dispute over the recognition of a trade union by the Spicer undertaking and secondly to the detention of the union leader, Moiss Escamilla.
.As regards the first aspect of the case, the undertaking had dismissed a large number of workers who had decided to withdraw from the Metallurgical Workers' Union of Mexico, the organisation recognised by the employer for purposes of collective bargaining, and join the National Union of Workers in the Iron, Steel and Allied Products Industry of Mexico. The dismissals had followed the participation of the workers in a strike in protest over the company's attitude to the formation and recognition of the new union. The Committee noted that the strike was declared not only while the legal procedure regarding the designation of the most representative union for the purpose of collective bargaining was under way, but also without respecting the rules established in the Federal Labour Code.
.The Committee also noted that, following intervention by the Secretary of Labour and Social Security, an agreement had been reached between the undertaking, a third union, the National Union of workers in Mines, Metallurgy and Allied Sectors of Mexico, and the negotiating Committee of the strikers. This had put an end to the strike. For its part, the National Union of Workers in the Iron, Steel and Allied Products Industry of Mexico had withdrawn for unknown reasons from the procedure for the designation of the representative union.
.The Committee pointed out that it was not clear how the undertaking had been able to embark on negotiations and sign an agreement with a third union while a procedure for the recognition of representative ness for the purposes of collective bargaining was under way between two other organisations. Consequently, the Committee requested additional information from the Government concerning the third union named and the recognition of this organisation by the undertaking.
.In its reply the Government explained that there had, in fact, been some confusion owing to imprecision in its statement of the facts. There had never been three unions involved in the case, but only two, since the first organisation mentioned, the Metallurgical Workers' Union of Mexico (see paragraph ) was the same as that mentioned in the third instance, namely the National Union of Workers in Mines, Metallurgy and Allied Sectors of Mexico (see Paragraph ). It was customary to abbreviate the name of the latter union to ""the Metallurgical Workers' Union"". According to the Government, what had happened was that when one of the two rival organisations involved in the procedure for the recognition of representative ness withdrew, the other retained its previous entitlement. The Committee notes that this was the organisation which signed the agreement with the undertaking which put an end to the strike.
.As regards the detention of Mr. Moiss Escamilla, who was subsequently released, the Government states that it has noted the Committee's remarks in paragraph  of the th report, to the effect that the authorities concerned should be instructed to proceed with caution in cases where action is taken against trade unionists, to eliminate the danger of over-hasty arrests which are frequently unjustified; for this reason, detainees are released after a short period.
.In these circumstances, and in the light of the Government's explanation indicated in paragraph  above, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case calls for no further examination on its part.
.The Committee already examined this case in February  and submitted a report to the Governing Body in which it adopted certain interim conclusions on the basis of the information then available. This report appears in paragraphs - of its th Report, which was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.Since then, the Government submitted further comments in a communication of  May .
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has not ratified the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the settlement of the matter following the conciliation efforts of the Secretariat of Labour and Social Security;(b) to request the Government to supply additional information regarding the National Union of workers in Mines, Metallurgy and Allied Sectors of Mexico and the recognition of that organisation by the Spicer undertaking;(c) whilst calling attention to the principle set out in paragraph  above, to note the release of Mr. Moises Escamilla and to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(d) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested in subparagraph (b) above.
.The complaint submitted by the World Confederation of Labour was contained in two communications, both dated  October , addressed to the Director-General.
.The complaint was duly transmitted to the Government which, in a communication dated  December , sent its observations thereon.
.Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has not ratified the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants alleged that trade union rights had been violated in the Spicer Company which is situated in the city of Mexico and is a subsidiary of the Dana Corporation of Detroit. For many years, the complainants explained, the workers in this company had been controlled by a trade union organisation known as the Federation of Workers' Groups which prohibited meetings, sold permanent posts, invented deaths in order to check off supplementary contributions from the workers, and dismissed, along with the company, workers who made any kind of protest.
.The complainants add that, faced with this situation, the workers decided to organise their own union and become affiliated to a union which was independent of the enterprise, viz. the National Union of Workers in the Iron, Steel and Allied Products Industry of Mexico, which is affiliated to the Latin American Central of Workers and the World Confederation of Labour. The registration and affiliation of the new union were refused by the registration department of the Secretariat of Labour and Social Welfare of Mexico, which deals with associations.
.The Spicer Company, continue the complainants, started a campaign of pressure, using physical threats and engaging a team of psychiatrists in order to convince the workers that they should not form an independent union. The workers continued to take all the legal steps which had been stopped for a year in the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Board, where proceedings had been instituted against the Federation of Workers' Groups as regards representation rights for collective bargaining.
.At the beginning of June , the complainants added, the Spicer Company threatened to dismiss  fixed-term workers if they did not withdraw from the independent union. All the workers in the company, accordingly, decided to strike as from  June in order to demand respect for their right to organise and form unions. The company reacted by dismissing all the leaders of the union. In order to prevent the legal steps taken against the Federation of Workers' Groups from succeeding, the company illegally terminated its collective agreement with the Federation and entered into negotiations with another union called the National Union of Metallurgical Mineworkers of Mexico. During the strike, the complainants alleged, the company entered into a new collective agreement with this union without consulting any of the workers.
.The strike terminated when the company agreed to reinstate the leaders of the independent union. A few days after the return to work, however, the company broke its agreement and dismissed the leaders who had been reinstated, along with  workers and, the same day, when they were being supported by the other workers in a public demonstration, the company dismissed another  workers, making  in all. On  September ,  of the workers, along with  of their wives, commenced a hunger strike, demanding respect for the right to organise.
.The complainants further alleged that the trade union leader, Moiss Escamilla, had been arbitrarily detained.
.In its reply to these allegations the Government pointed out that the Secretariat of Labour and Social Welfare had intervened to conciliate in the dispute between the workers and the Spicer Company, in accordance with its duty to safeguard the rights of the workers, and independently of any questions which had arisen between the unions. The Government stated that, as a result of deliberation between the parties, an agreement was reached under which",0,1975,Mexico
206,".The Director-General has received a communication from the WCL, dated  November , containing allegations regarding interference with the exercise of trade union rights in Mexico.
.In its letter, the WCL states that on the orders of the Governor of the State of Sonora in Mexico, the police of that State fired upon several hundred peasants to drive them from the land they had occupied in application of the Agrarian Reform Act. This decision to open fire without warning on totally unarmed workers constitutes, the complainants add, an act of bloody and utterly inexcusable repression which cannot be condemned too strongly.
.The WCL states that it is submitting a complaint concerning infringement of trade union rights and it holds the view that the type of action which the Mexican authorities put a stop to must be put on the same footing as an occupation of work premises by urban workers. The action taken by the peasants, who are organised in ejidos (""communes"") does indeed, according to the WCL, relate to trade union activities and thus falls within the competence of the Committee. Mexico has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) in Article  of which the term ""organisation"" is defined as any organisation of workers or of employers for furthering and defending the interests of workers or of employers. According to the WCL, Convention No.  is applicable even though it is peasants who are involved and their organisations are-called ""ejidos"" and not ""trade unions"". Mexico, the WCL goes on to state, is not respecting the fundamental conditions that are essential for exercising the rights set forth in Convention No.  and, if an act has been committed which may be described as being outside the law, it is the Mexican authorities and police who are mainly responsible for committing it. The WCL adds that this intervention involves a violation of fundamental human rights and civil liberties in respect of peasants who want nothing more than to hold land in accordance with the Agrarian Reform Act.
.The case now before the Committee contains allegations of a particularly grave nature, but the Committee must consider whether these matters involve a breach of trade union rights and can be examined under the procedure in force.
.The Committee recalls that it has already examined another case in which peasants had occupied land to which they claimed a right. When they refused to leave the land a confrontation had taken place and the police and armed forces had resorted to force. While acknowledging that these events were extremely serious, the Committee had considered that the issue was not the exercise of trade union rights but rather a question of land ownership and tenure governed by specific national legislation having nothing to do with the problems of freedom of association.",0,1975,Mexico
207,".The Committee has examined this case on several occasions and, in particular, at its May  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.The Government has supplied its observations in a communication of  September .
.Chile has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its May  Session, the Committee had reached interim conclusions on the outstanding aspect of the case, namely the proceedings against ten leaders of the National Trade Union Coordination Body (Coordinadora Nacional Sindical), (CNS), including Messrs. Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn, respectively President and General Secretary of that organisation. The Committee had noted that these two leaders were no longer imprisoned. However, considering the new allegations that they and eight other leaders of the CNS had been sentenced by the Appeal Court to  days' imprisonment and that they would serve their sentence if the appeal they had brought was rejected, the Committee had stressed the danger to the free exercise of trade union rights of measures of detention and sentencing of workers' representatives in connection with activities related to the protection of the interests of the persons they represent. Noting that appeals had been brought, the Committee had requested the Government to keep it informed of the results of the case.
.Furthermore, the Committee had asked to be kept informed of any developments in two other aspects of the case: the inquiries into the disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists, and of developments in trade union legislation.
.In its letter of  September , the Government points out that on  June , the Ministry of the Interior dropped the judicial action it had taken against ten leaders of the illegal organisation Coordinadora Nacional Sindical on the grounds that they had usurped the role of workers' representatives in violation of Decree No.  of . The examining magistrate had accepted that the judicial action be abandoned and ordered the withdrawal of the action from the list of current proceedings and the filing away of all the information in the dossier. The Ministry of the Interior's decision to drop the case has the effect of cancelling the criminal action and quashing the sentence passed at first instance.
.The Government makes it clear that its aim in adopting this measure is to enable the accused to change their behaviour.
.The Government attaches to its letter the Minister of the Interior's letter abandoning the proceedings, and the decisions taken by the examining magistrate.
.The Committee notes with interest that the judicial proceedings against the leaders of the Coordinadora National Sindical have been dropped and that the prison sentences passed at first instance have been quashed. The Committee is convinced that these measures will help to restore a climate favourable to the development of industrial relations in the country. It expresses the firm hope that it will now be possible to establish constructive social relations between Government, employers' organisations and workers' unions of all tendencies.
.Finally, as the Government's reply contains no information on the trade union legislation and the disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists, the Committee must recall that it wishes to be kept informed of any developments in the matter of trade union legislation, as well as of the development of the inquiries under way into the disappearances. It urges the Government to adopt amendments to bring the trade union law into conformity with the principles of freedom of association.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) The Committee notes with interest that the proceedings brought against the leaders of the Coordinadora Nacional Sindical have been dropped and that the prison sentences passed at first instance have been quashed. It expresses the firm hope that it will now be possible to establish constructive social relations between the Government, employers' organisations and trade unions of all tendencies.(b) The Committee again urges the Government to adopt amendments to bring the trade union law into conformity with the principles of freedom of association. It requests the Government to keep it informed of any developments as regards the trade union legislation.(c) The Committee also requests the Government to keep it informed of the development of the inquiries under way into the disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists.
.The Committee has examined this case on several occasions and, in particular, at its meeting in November  when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since then, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has supplied further information in telegrams dated  and  December  and  and  May .
.The Government supplied its observations in two communications dated  February and  April .
.Chile has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its November  Session the Committee had reached interim conclusions on two aspects of the case. On the one hand, the Committee had requested the Government to supply information on the results of the legal proceedings pending against two leaders of the national Trade Union Co-ordination Body (Coordinadora Nacional Sindical) (CNS), Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn who, according to the complainants, had been arrested for presenting a list of demands on behalf of their organisation. On the other hand, the Committee had requested the Government to supply its observations on the dismissal of  workers of the Panal Textile Undertaking, allegedly as a result of their trade union activities during the -day strike which had been organised in that undertaking.
.Furthermore, the Committee had asked to be kept informed of any subsequent developments concerning two other aspects of the case, viz. the inquiries undertaken into the disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists and the trade union legislation.
.In its telegram dated  December  the ICFTU refers to the arrest on  and  December  of two advisers of the CNS and the executive secretary of the Chile Committee for Human Rights, Eugenio Diaz Corvalan, Sergio Aguil and Germn Molina Valdiviego.
.In its telegram dated  December , the ICFTU states that it had been informed that the prosecution authorities considered that there was not sufficient evidence to prosecute Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn. In spite of that, the ICFTU adds, the Court decided to prosecute them and the case will be referred to the Supreme Court. The ICFTU recalls that the activities of the two trade unionists were always in accordance with the mandate conferred on them by the Chilean workers, and it calls for their release.
.Commenting on the Committees previous conclusions on the proceedings against Manuel Bustos and Alamiro Guzmn, the Government recalls, in particular, that the CNS has no legal existence, and that  trade union organisations stated that they would not sign the ""register of national demands"" prepared by the CNS even though the latter mentioned them among its affiliates. The Government stated that the demands submitted were not social and occupational, and that the legislation offers the broadest freedom to form federations and Confederations.
.As regards the situation of the two trade union leaders in question, the Government recalls that they had violated the provisions of section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  concerning the usurping of trade union representation. Nevertheless, the persons concerned were released on  December . Their trials are at the investigatory stage and it is hoped that the investigating magistrate will soon hand down his decision.
.As regards the dismissal of workers of the Panal Textile Undertaking, the Government observes that the allegations were contained in a document drawn up by a body known as the ""Sole Central Trade Union Organisation of Chilean Workers"" which has no legal existence. On the substance of the matter, the Government explains that two collective bargaining procedures were engaged in at the Panal undertaking, corresponding to each of the existing trade unions.
.Negotiations with trade union No.  began on  August  and ended on  October  with the signing of a collective agreement. A strike was voted for on  September but it finally did not take place. Negotiations with trade union No.  began on  August  and ended on  December . In accordance with the law, the workers demanded that the employer sign a new collective agreement under the conditions obtaining at the time when the draft agreement was first presented- with these conditions being, however, updated and subject to readjustment. The workers went on strike from  October to  December , the date on which they went back to work. From  to  January  the management of the enterprise terminated the contracts of  workers for dishonesty, acts of violence, insults or serious immoral conduct, absence from work for two days without explanation and the operational requirements of the undertaking. Only two of these dismissed workers",0,1975,Chile
208,"with the police and admitted to the Maranhao State Medical Centre. As a militant activist, he had followed courses in guerrilla warfare abroad. He had been jobless for a long time and had often been arrested for interrogation in the various States which he had visited. He had no trade union connection and lived in hiding; the Government had been informed of some of his travels abroad using false passports. The Government recalled that he had been released in May  and arrested again in Sao Paulo on  December  for interrogation, but had been released the following day. It stressed that this person was a typical subversive agent who had held no job for a long time and consequently had no connection with trade union life.
.Joao Massena Melo, continued the Government, had not held trade union office for  years and, moreover, had had no connection with any union whatsoever since . He devoted himself solely to terrorism, as he had done all his life, since he had been arrested and sentenced for illegal activities already in . He went on trial in  for subversion and had acted in a manner prejudicial to trade union life, and particularly in violation of section  of the consolidated labour legislation (conditions for the operation of trade unions).
.The Government explained that the Metalworkers' Union had been transformed at a certain stage into a centre for subversive agitation, although political and ideological propaganda were banned within organisations of that kind. Subversion had reached such a point within that union that ""the sailors' mutiny"" had set up its headquarters within it. Its leaders called for acts of indiscipline, rebellion and armed struggle amongst the personnel of the navy. The ""sailors' mutiny"", which almost led to civil war in the country, involved some dozens of rebelling soldiers who took up quarters at the union headquarters and were finally dislodged by the army in . The persons concerned were tried with those who had given them backing, including some of the union's leaders. The case came before the naval court, as it involved a crime against national security. The violations of trade union life had such far-reaching effects within this union that the Ministry of Labour was obliged to put it under guardianship and penal action was finally taken against the former leaders, who had acted as subversive agents, and were responsible for misappropriations and misuse of union property. The union's finances were compromised to such an extent that the organisation was unable to resume a normal existence for a long time, and not until the situation had been restored to order by a representative of the Ministry of Labour.
.Joao Massena Melo, continued the Government, carried out subversive activities clandestinely as leader of a prohibited political party. He had been sentenced to five years' imprisonment in , but did not serve his sentence, which has come under the statute of limitations. In , he had again been sentenced to two years' imprisonment following another trial for which he had been under preventive arrest. Penal action was brought against him in , but he was now living in hiding and his residence was unknown.
.According to the Government, Osvaldo Pacheo da Silva was one of the oldest and most active leaders of subversion in Brazil. He had been sought by the police during the s, at which time he had already ceased all trade union activity and had been struck off the stevedores' roll. He subsequently succeeded in being re-registered and becoming elected president of the National Port Workers' Federation. Action had been brought against him in  for subversive activities: he had stirred up about  political strikes in various essential services (ports, transportation, electric power), despite legal prohibition. He had been tried for subversive activities in , especially for having encouraged port workers to refuse all service on American ships anchored in the port of Santos. He was considered responsible in  for large-scale activities amongst peasants' leagues in rural areas. Osvaldo Pacheco who was associated with the Growers' and Agricultural Workers', Union of Brazil, an illegal organisation which sponsored the occupation of rural properties and encouraged other forms of violence, at the same time succeeded in setting up in the towns another underground organisation known as the Workers' General Command, the existence of which as a trade union organisation has never been authorised by law. In , he had been acquitted under the limitation of statutes in a trial in which he was accused of violation of the law on security and he left the country. He was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment on  May  for violation of sections  and  of the then existing law on national security (Act No. /). Having re-entered Brazil in  under a false identity, he exercised various activities in the State of Rio Grande do Sul; on  June , he was sentenced to four years' hard labour after trial for violation of section  of Legislative Decree No. / (reorganisation of an organisation which had been dissolved, suspended or which was prejudicial to national security). The Government emphasised that the person in question had held no trade union office since , in particular because he was no longer registered on the stevedores' roll. The complaint with regard to violation of trade union freedom, or ""torture"" was unfounded.
.The Government stated that Manoel Jos Constantino had been president of the Sao Caetano do Sul Metalworkers' Union, but had left on retirement. The Government also referred to Jos Ferreira da Silva - and not Jose Cerreiro - vice-president of the same union. These two persons had been arrested for an inquiry as investigations had shown that they had participated in the activities of subversive groups. Manoel Josh Constantino had been held from  to  October  for interrogation and had then been released. Jos Ferreira da Silva, who was responsible for organising subversive groups within plants, had been arrested on  October  and released the following  December. The results of the investigations had been transmitted to the courts, which had acquitted the two persons for lack of proof. The Government stressed that their detention and trial had no connection with their trade union activities.
.Jos Duarte, stated the Government, had manifested his militancy as early as , in subversive activities in the State of Sao Paulo. In , he had been arrested for having led movements supporting the reorganisation of an association prohibited by law. He had been identified under a false name in , as agitator in several towns in the State of Sao Paulo. He had been spotted in  at meetings in support of armed revolution and reversal of the established order. He was sentenced in  to one year's hard labour. Finally, in , he was charged in the course of an inquiry opened in the State of Cear for subversive activities in that State. He was at present on the run. The Government pointed out that the person concerned had held no job for a long time and that he had been sentenced not on account of his trade union activities, but for violations of national security legislation.
.The Government stated several times that these cases were not bound up with trade union activities and therefore did not fall within the terms of reference of the Committee. It added that Brazil did not submit its laws and court decisions to examination or appraisal, but in order to maintain the position of principle already referred to, it indicated the relevant regulations and provided data concerning the persons mentioned by the complainants. The Government stated that it accepted dialogue, but refused all interference in its internal affairs, such as the claim to the right to have examined by an international organisation with limited terms of reference, a matter not falling within those terms of reference. In full exercise of its sovereignty, continued the Government, Brazil ensured respect for its Constitution and other legislation and, in doing so, differed from no other country.
.The Government added that the persons referred to by the complainants had no need to be defended or protected against any danger whatsoever. Their rights and liberties had not been attacked. Three of them had been sentenced after due trial, at which the rights of defence, full publicity for the procedure and the right of appeal were at all times respected (Joao Massena Melo, Osvaldo Pacheco da Silva, Jos Duarte). The other three had been acquitted (Manoel Conceicao dos Santos, Manoel Jos Constantino, Jos Ferreira da Silva). Detention for interrogation had been carried out in accordance with legal police procedure and had been immediately notified to the competent judge. The detentions had been necessary to permit investigation of the responsibility of the persons engaged in illegal activities designed to overthrow established political institutions. The conclusions of the investigations carried out by the police authorities had been communicated to the Minister of the Public, for examination and transmission, if necessary, to",0,1975,Brazil
209,"on  February  and to have been tortured so much that he lost his reason; the complainants attached the text of an open letter from his wife denouncing this violence. The WFTU referred again to the murder of Vladimir Herzog, director of the reporters division of the second channel of the Sao Paulo cultural television service.
.The complainants added that, since , the Brazilian trade union movement had been subjected to unremitting repression and interference on the part of the authorities. They quoted statements made to the press by several trade union leaders in Sao Paulo regarding deficiencies in the protection of trade union rights and the statement made by the Secretary for Public Safety in Sao Paulo to the effect that the repressive measures were caused by the state of war existing in the country. The WFTU referred again to the arrest, amongst others, of Manoel Constantino and Jos Cerreiro, president and vice-president respectively, of the Sao Caeteno Metalworkers' Union. It added that wages are fixed by the ministry of Labour without any consultation of the trade unions and that the latter are deprived of the fundamental right to defend the rights and uphold the demands of workers, in defiance of the law and international agreements signed by Brazil.
.In its complaint of  December , which is supported by the WCL, the CLAT pointed out that Manoel Conceicao dos Cantos, a peasant trade union leader, had been imprisoned four years ago. After two years' imprisonment during which, according to the complainants, he was subjected to torture, he was released in a serious condition. The Cardinal of Sao Paulo had to intervene in order to have him admitted to a hospital in which he underwent a surgical operation and subsequent treatment as an outpatient. The CLAT added that this same person was again imprisoned on  October  at Osasco (in the industrial zone of Sao Paulo) and that his present whereabouts were unknown, a fact which gave grounds to fear for his life. The CLAT also communicated a series of documents supporting its allegations.
.The WFTU further stated in its telegram of  January  that Jos Manoel Fiel Filho, a militant of the metalworkers' trade union had been killed on  January  after imprisonment by the armed forces. It also alleged, in its letter of  January , that Jos Duarte, trade union leader in the national railways of the north-east, had been detained without trial since . According to the WFTU, he was subjected to ill-treatment whilst in Bahia state prison and was today in a prison of the Paulo Sarasarte Penal Institute in the State of Cear. He was  years old and was said to have had a heart attack as a result of this bad treatment.
.In a communication of  September , the Government stated that Manoel Conceicao dos Santos had been sentenced to three years' imprisonment under section  of Legislative Decree No. /, which defines crimes against national security and political and social order. He had served his sentence and had been released on  May . He had been arrested again on  November  for questioning and released on  December . In its letter of  November , the Government stated that the Committee was not competent to examine this case, since it did not concern trade union leaders or militants. According to the Government, the persons named by the complainants did not exercise any administrative functions in a trade union, were not trade union militants and had not at any time been arrested in connection with trade union activity.
.In a subsequent letter of  February , the Government stated the reasons for which it had been unable to provide the information requested from it. It stated that under the Brazilian Constitutional system, the executive, legislative and judicial powers were independent of each other and under the judicial procedure, it was the executive power which started proceedings. Action had been started against the persons mentioned by the WFTU before the courts of the various national States and the accused had been suspended from work pending the court holidays (extending from the st (November ) to the nd (March ) Sessions of the Governing Body).
.In a detailed letter of  August , the Government stated that it had always expressed its support for the defence of human rights, which include trade union rights. Strict respect for the principles deriving from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations Charter and the ILO Constitution, which were involved in the case under discussion, did not conflict with the respect of other essential principles of international coexistence, which prohibited interference in the internal affairs of a State and those relating to its sovereignty. The information which it provided, continued the Government, had to be examined in the light of the positions of principle upheld by Brazil before the Human Rights Commission and other bodies in which the many aspects of these provisions were discussed. It had submitted the information in a desire to maintain a constructive dialogue with the Committee, to tightening its bonds with ILO and in the conviction that the information provided would constitute a complete and final denial of the allegations which had been made.
.The Government further stated that there exists in Brazil an ordinary justice, organised in accordance with the standards of the Constitution, the competence of which corresponds to the universal principle of natural law. There are neither trial privileges nor exceptional courts; penal action is conducted by a court and a judge selected according to the cause of the litigation and not the persons accused; every person can appeal against a sentence. Defence rights are fully guaranteed.
.Moreover, added the Government, the Federal Constitution protects freedom of association and expression and the right to hold political and philosophical convictions. It simultaneously prohibits all propaganda in support of war or subversion and acts designed to create or strengthen prejudice or discrimination on grounds of religion, race or social status. Violations of national security legislation (Legislative Decree No. /) are also dealt with in accordance with ordinary procedure offering the aforementioned safeguards. The essential condition for any sentence based on this law is the existence of a specific fraudulent intention, the intention to prejudice or weaken internal or external state security. The Government has an obligation, it stated, to maintain the order essential for general well-being by assuring the country's development, and public security and peace. It was essential to prevent and, if necessary, to sanction acts designed to overthrow established order, destroy political institutions or harm progress and peace. Recourse was therefore had to the penal laws and the police system which these laws necessarily imply when offences are committed or when the State supposed, on the basis of well-established facts, that offences had been committed.
.The Government denied that there were political detainees in Brazil belonging to the trade union movement. Those of the persons mentioned by the complainants, who were the subject of criminal proceedings, had been accused of subversive acts; some had already been acquitted and others had been sentenced after being found guilty of violations of national security laws. They had been judged by ordinary courts, and had enjoyed the universal safeguards provided by penal procedure. The integrity and impartiality of the judges were proved by the acquittals pronounced on the grounds of inadequate legal proof and not because of the innocence of the accused persons, whose subversive activities were well known. With the exception of two cases, the Government emphasised, the persons mentioned in the complaints were not even associated with the trade union movement when they performed the illegal acts which led to their detention for the purposes of inquiry, or imprisonment on decision of the courts. The complainants had misrepresented the facts to make it appear that they affected trade union rights, which was not the case. The Government enclosed statements from employers' and workers' Confederations certifying that to the best of their knowledge nobody had been sentenced in Brazil on account of trade union activities.
.Regarding Manoel Conceicao dos Santos, the Government pointed out that he had been sentenced once for having organised the workers of several districts for political purposes, with a view to entering agricultural property, seizing land and installing peasants' families by force. The movement was directed against all owners in the area possessing enclosed properties. The enclosures were to be pulled down and destroyed, the occupants were to start collective farming there and the owners were to be prohibited passage over their own land. In the event of any of the latter reacting, they were to be assassinated by the farmers. A group of farmers, associated with the peasants' league, an illegal organisation, had destroyed the enclosures of several farm properties, under the leadership of Manoel Conceicao dos Santos.
.According to the Government, the person in question took part in clandestine activities, including guerrilla training, in the Pindare-Mirim valley in . In , he was injured during a clash",0,1975,Brazil
210,".The Committee has already examined this case at its November  session, when it submitted interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report in November  (th Session).
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still outstanding concern the situation of Mr. Jos Duarte. The WFTU had alleged that Mr. Duarte, a trade union leader on the railways in the north-east of the country, had been detained without trial since ; it claimed that he had suffered ill-treatment whilst in Bahia state prison, and that he was now in the prison of the Paulo Sarasarte Penal Institute in the State of Cear. Aged about  years, he was said to have had a heart attack as a result of this ill-treatment.
.According to the Government, Jose Duarte had manifested his militantism as early as  in subversive activities in the State of Sao Paulo. In  he had been arrested for having led movements supporting the reorganisation of an association prohibited by law. In  he had been identified under a false name as an agitator in several towns in the State of Sao Paulo. He had been spotted in  at meetings in support of armed revolution and reversal of the established order. He had been sentenced in  to one year's hard labour. Finally, in , he had been charged in the course of an inquiry opened in the State of Cear into subversive activities in that State. He was at present on the run. The Government pointed out that he had held no job for a long time and that he had been sentenced not on account of his trade union activities, but for breaches of national security legislation. The Government further stated that Jos Duarte had been sentenced after due trial, at which the rights of defence, full publicity for the proceedings and the right of appeal were assured.
.In November , the Committee noted that the Government had not replied to the allegations to the effect that Jos Duarte had been a trade union leader on the railways in the northeast of the country. It also drew attention to contradictions between the information provided by the complainants and that provided by the Government. According to the WFTU, Jose Duarte had been under arrest since  (the WFTU even named the place of detention); according to the Government he was on the run. On the Committee's recommendation, the Governing Body requested the Government to provide information on the factors which had led to the indictment against Jos Duarte in .
.The Government replied by a letter dated  February . In , it states, this person was reported to the public prosecutor for the Fourth Military Region for crimes against national security within the meaning of sections (IV),  and  of Act No. /. Finally, still for crimes against national security, he was sentenced by the court for the Tenth Military Judicial District to four years' hard labour for breaches of sections  and () and (II) of Legislative Decree No. /. Under the terms of section , ""reorganising or attempting to reorganise, de facto or de jure, even under a false name or in a simulated manner, an association or a political party dissolved in pursuance of a statutory provision or a court decision, or engaged in activities prejudicial or dangerous to national security, or enabling such an association or party to operate, under the same conditions, while it is legally suspended"", is punishable by from two to five years' hard labour. Under the terms of section  ""making subversive propaganda, () using any media for social communication such as newspapers, magazines, periodicals, books, bulletins, pamphlets, radio, television, cinema, theatre and other similar media as vehicles for hostile propaganda or psychological warfare or revolutionary or subversive warfare; (II) suborning persons at workplaces or educational establishments"", is punishable by from one to three years' hard labour.
.He was arrested, continues the Government, following investigations by the federal police in the State of Cear, where he was engaged in subversive activities. In prison, he was guilty of inciting prisoners to take part in a revolt, which finally involved all the prisoners. Contrary to the allegations, declares the Government, this person was under medical care while in prison and was visited by the doctor in the normal manner; his state of health was perfect when he left the prison. Upon completion of his sentence he was released, and went back into hiding; his whereabouts are unknown.
.The Government states that at Jos Duarte's trial his rights of defence were respected and that it was possible for him to appeal to the higher courts.
.According to the Government, this person has not engaged in any occupation or lawful activity for at least  years, and accordingly has no links with the trade union movement. Contrary to the allegations to the effect that he was a trade union leader on the railways in the north-east, the Union of Workers in the North-Eastern Railway Companies has stated that its records make no mention of any official or member by the name of Jos Duarte. Nor is his name to be found in the records of the Regional Delegation for Labour in the State of Pernambuco, where the union has its headquarters. The Government recalls that it has already forwarded statements by employers' and workers' Confederations attesting to the fact that nobody has been sentenced in Brazil for engaging in lawful trade union activities. All these facts, it concludes, together with those already examined by the Committee in connection with this case, suffice to prove that here again the person concerned was not a worker exercising any form of occupational activity whatsoever whose rights, protected by the ILO Conventions, might have been infringed. Jos Duarte served his sentence for activities contrary to the law, totally unconnected with trade union affairs.
.The Committee notes this information. It notes in particular that according to the Government, Jos Duarte was sentenced for breaches of Legislative Decree No. /, respecting national security, and that after serving his sentence he was released in perfect health. These statements contradict the allegations that this person has been detained without trial since  and subjected to ill-treatment. The Committee notes, however, that the Government has not supplied details of the concrete facts which led to his being sentenced to four years' hard labour.
.The Government repeats that Jos Duarte has not engaged in an occupation, and hence in trade union activities, for a number of years. The complainant organisation for its part, has not furnished particulars of the trade union activities in which this person is said to have engaged. The Committee regrets that it does not have fuller information on this case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note the Government's statement that Jos Duarte was sentenced to four years' hard labour for breaches of national security, and that he was released after serving his sentence.
.The complaint from the World Federation of Trade Unions is contained in a telegram of  November . The WFTU submitted additional information and new allegations in communications of  and  November ,  January  and  January . The Latin American Workers' Central (CLAT) also submitted a complaint, by a letter of  December . In a communication of  December , the World Confederation of Labour stated that it supported the allegations made by the CLAT.
.These complaints and the additional information were transmitted to the Government, which submitted comments by letters of  September and  November ,  February and  August .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WFTU submitted the following allegations in its first communication. Joao Massena Mela, former secretary of the metalworkers' Union of Rio de Janeiro, had been arrested; Osvaldo Pacheco, former secretary of the Sao Paulo Dockworkers' Union, had been tortured; Vladimir Herzog, journalist with the cultural channel of the Sao Paulo television service had been killed; Manoel Conceicao dos Santos, president of the Maranhao Rural Workers, Union, already injured in , had been tortured again on  October . The complainants added, in their telegram of  November , that Manoel Constantino and Jos Cerreiro (see below) had been arrested arbitrarily with other trade union leaders.
.In its letter of  November , the WFTU stated that the families of the persons arrested had no idea where they were and suspected that they had been killed in prison. The complainants mentioned once again the names of Joao Massena Melo, arrested at the beginning of , and Osvaldo Pacheco, (who was also president of the National Federation of Stevedores); the latter was said to have been arrested",0,1975,Brazil
211,"judicial proceedings. Some lawyers publicly expressed the opinion that the inquiries through the courts should continue since, if this was not done, it would not be possible to know whether or not there existed any facts which could be covered by the amnesty. In any event, the authorities pointed out that they would make inquiries as to the actual state of the procedures concerning the persons mentioned in the report of the Committee on Freedom of Association and inform the ILO of the result.
.The Committee regrets that it is unable to note from the information supplied by the Government that any progress has been made as regards the supply of the information expected concerning the persons mentioned in the present case who are said to have been detained or who have disappeared and who appear on the list annexed to the Committees th Report. The Committee cannot fail to note the contradictions between the statements made by the Government and those made by the complainants who have supplied various details concerning the detention of numerous trade unionists or former trade unionists who have subsequently disappeared.
.The Committee notes that a number of habeas corpus applications are presently being dealt with by the courts concerning persons who have disappeared and that the authorities will inform the ILO as to the full scope of these judicial procedures. In the opinion of the Committee, whatever the scope of the amnesty which has been decreed, the amnesty itself should not prevent further inquiries being made to clarify the situation of these persons.
.The complainants had referred to the assignment to forced residence of the following trade union officials: Georgina Aceituno, Juan Sepulveda, Hernn Mery and Samuel Astorga. The Government had stated that these measures had been taken by virtue of the special powers conferred on the President of the Republic by Legislative Decree No.  of , which were subject to the control of the courts. In the case in question the court of Appeal of Santiago, seized of an appeal, had confirmed the measures taken, but ruled that the Government should not have fixed the place of residence of those persons in the province to which they were assigned. They themselves had the right to choose their place of residence within that province.
.At its session in February-March , the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to state the precise reasons for which measures of assignment had been taken against these persons.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states that the persons concerned were set completely free on  March  and their transfer to Arica was brought to an end. The Government points out that the measure taken with respect to these persons was a transfer from one province to another, which is not a penal sanction and should not be confused with the penalty of assignment to forced residence imposed by the law courts as a punishment for an offence. The persons mentioned in the complaint had been transferred to the north of the country after being caught attending a meeting deemed to be clandestine under the terms of the State Security Act and the Legislative Decree on the dissolution of political parties, inasmuch as officials and former members of parliament belonging to dissolved political parties were also present. According to the Government, there was no question of its being a trade union meeting.
.During the direct contacts mission the Secretary of State for the Interior confirmed to the representative of the Director-General that recourse to this measure of transfer, which had already been repealed, had been necessitated as a result of the participation by the persons concerned in a political meeting that had been organised in a church. The Secretary of State indicated that he would endeavour to obtain further information on the facts of the matter. It was not possible for the representative of the Director-General to obtain this further information before his departure from Chile.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the participation of the persons concerned in a political meeting was the reason for the measures of transfer that were taken by the Government. In any event, having regard to the fact that these persons are now free, the Committee considers that no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of this aspect of the case.
.With regard to the trade union officials who had been deprived of their nationality - Luis Meneses, General Secretary of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUT), and Humberto Elgueta and Ernesto Araneda, members of the External Committee of the CUT - the Government had stated that these persons, who were living abroad, had behaved in an unpatriotic manner. Such an attitude was punishable under the Chilean Constitution by loss of nationality, and the Government had no alternative but to enforce this provision. One of the persons in question, Mr. Elgueta, had availed himself of the opportunity open to him to lodge an appeal with the Supreme Court, which had declared the measure taken against him to be null and void.
.On the Committee's recommendation, the Governing Body, in February-March , noted with interest the rescinding of the measure taken against Mr. Elgueta and suggested to the Government, bearing in mind the decision taken by the Supreme Court, the possibility of reconsidering, with respect to the other two persons named by the complainants, the extremely serious deprivation of rights to which they had been subjected.
.In its communication of  March , the Government repeats the information already provided for the Committee's last session. It adds that as far as it knows, Mr. Meneses and Mr. Araneda have not lodged an appeal.
.From the information supplied by the President of the Supreme Court and the Minister of Justice during the direct contacts mission, it seems that the revoking of the measure taken concerning persons who have not lodged an appeal with the courts would require a new legislative provision of the Government. In addition, as a result of the coming to an end of the state of siege, the penalty of deprivation of nationality cannot be imposed by the Executive.
.The Committee takes note of this information. It suggests that the Government, in the spirit in which the amnesty was recently granted, re-examine the measure which affects Mr. Meneses and Mr. Araneda.
.At its February  session the Committee examined complaints relating to the assignment to forced residence in the north of the country on  November  of seven trade unionists, including three copper workers' leaders (Milton Puga, Director of the El Teniente Copper Salaried Employees' Union; Juan Fincheira, President of the Copper Salaried Employees' Union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and Metallurgy Workers; Carlos Arellano, Director of the Copper Manual workers' Union). According to the Government, these officials had been assigned to forced residence ""for having engaged in political agitation in the trade union field and organised acts of indiscipline at work completely incompatible with national security"". According to the complainants, however, they had been victimised for exercising their trade union rights. Later the Government had stated that the officials in question had been freed on  December  and had returned to their homes.
.In its communication of  March , the WFTU states that the three officials mentioned in the preceding paragraph have been forced to resign from their trade union office by order of the military government of the province. They have been replaced in their functions by decree, and in addition they have been dismissed from their jobs.
.In its communication of  April  the CLAT refers to the removal from office by decree of two trade union leaders of the National Confederation of Bank Associations of the State of Chile, namely the Chairman, Andres del Capo Hamel, and its Vice-President, Arturo Moreno Patino. This decree is based on article  of the Decree Law No.  as amended by the Decree Laws Nos.  and  which permit the intendant of a province to demand the resignation of trade union leaders of those organisations at which these decree laws are directed. The reasons given show that within the executive of this organisation there existed divergences of opinion which prevented it from functioning properly.
.The CLAT points out that on  January  the intendant of the fifth region adopted a resolution which obliged the president of the National Federation of Port Workers of Chile, Mr. Carlos Frez Rojo, to hand in his resignation as leader of this organisation within  hours. Thereafter he was stripped of his functions as president by a decree dated  January . This trade union leader had to change his place of work and for this purpose he was sent to the extreme north of the country.
.Mention is also made in the communications of the WFTU and the ICFTU of the fact that by Resolution No.  dated  March  of the Ministry of Labour four new trade union leaders were appointed in order to make",0,1975,Chile
212,"had never been, according to the Government, a trade union official; he had been a Member of Parliament until .
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government concerning the three persons named in the preceding paragraph, but observes that it is in complete contradiction with the allegations referring to their arrest.
.The Committee draws the attention of the complainant organisations to this reply.
.Furthermore, the Government has not yet replied to the allegations concerning the temporary arrest of the caretaker of the FENSIMET's headquarters and the ill-treatment he is said to have suffered.
.As concerns the circumstances of the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, the Committee had previously drawn attention to certain discrepancies between the Government's statements and the evidence taken from various witnesses, and had recommended that the inquiry be continued.
.The Committee is bound to observe that this recommendation has not been acted upon, and it deplores the fact that, as a result, it is impossible for it to form an opinion in full knowledge of the facts on such a serious aspect of this case.
.The Committee further regrets that the Government's recent communications contain no information with respect to the many persons named by the complainants as having been arrested or disappeared, whereas the Committee had hoped to obtain particulars, inter alia, as to the results of the further investigations undertaken by the Supreme Court into the disappearance of  serving or former trade union officials. More generally, the Government had been requested to carry out thorough inquiries into the cases of disappearance. But the Government's reply is that it will supply all the available information by  April .
.The Committee appends to this report a list of the persons in respect of whom information - or further information - has been requested from the Government but not yet supplied, and urges the Government to supply detailed particulars as to the situation of these persons.
.Several trade union organisations (WFTU, WCL, FIEMC, FENSIMET, CLAT and UIBWM) have referred to the arrest and subsequent assignment to forced residence of the following seven trade union officials: Carlos Frez Rojo, President of the National Port Workers' Federation and the Unitarian Workers' Front; Arturo Latuz Favi, Director of the Copper Manual Workers' Union (""El Teniente"" Mine); Milton Puga, Director of the Copper Salaried Employees' Union (""El Teniente"" Mine); Juan Fincheira, President of the Copper Salaried Employees' Union and Deputy General Secretary of the Latin American Committee for Miners and Metallurgy Workers; Juan Manuel Sepulveda, Vice-President of the FENSIMET; Carlos Arellano, Director of the Copper Manual Workers' Union, and Hctor Hugo Cuevas Salvador, PRESIDENT of the FIEMC. According to the Government, they have been assigned to forced residence ""for having engaged in political agitation in the trade union field and organised acts of indiscipline at work completely incompatible with national security"". According to the complainants, these persons have been victimised for exercising trade union rights, although their activities formed part of their trade union duties as representatives of their organisations and of the workers, and their demands related to conditions of work.
.The complainants have drawn attention to the plunge in the purchasing power of wages and the blatant inadequacy of the adjustments granted on the ground of inflation. They have also referred to arbitrary dismissals, unfair treatment by employers, lack of freedom to organise, hold meetings, elect representatives in full freedom, submit pay claims, negotiate improved conditions and go on strike, and the problem of unemployment in town and country. Petitions addressed to the Government by trade union organisations, they continued, had gone unanswered, and requests to see officials had been refused; on the contrary, the unions were accused of engaging in politics and behaving unpatriotically.
.According to these organisations, the banished union officials were merely doing their duty and endeavouring to carry out faithfully the mandate given to them by the workers; they did not organise any work stoppages nor engage in subversive activities; while there may have been a few instances of indiscipline at work, they arose out of problems still unsolved. The complainants added that it was not by banishing, nor imprisoning, nor threatening people that these problems could be solved.
.The complainants went on to state that the workers at the ""El Teniente"" Mine, those at the port of Valparaiso, building workers, metalworkers and others had been seeking wage increases. Immediately following the El Teniente miners' strike  workers had been dismissed. The complainants pointed out that the trade unionists assigned to forced residence had been separated from their families and deprived of means of subsistence and medical supplies in an inhospitable region subject to extremes in temperature in the north of the country. In conclusion, one of the complainant organisations requested that a representative of the Director-General be sent to Chile as a matter of urgency.
.In several communications the Government stated that the trade union officials mentioned in paragraph  had been assigned on  November  to forced residence in towns in the north of the country for breaches of the legal provisions in force. They had been freed on  December  by Decree No.  of  December  (of which the Government supplies a copy), issued by the Ministry of the Interior, and returned to their homes.
.The Committee notes with interest the release of these persons. It observes, however, that the penalty of assignment to forced residence was imposed on them without any judicial proceedings having been initiated against them, and that the Government has not specified the offences of which they were accused.
.As the Committee has already had occasion to point out in earlier cases, although the fact of exercising trade union activity or holding trade union office does not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the absence of guarantees of due process of law may lead to abuses and allow trade union officials to be penalised pursuant to decisions based on groundless accusations. It may also create a climate of insecurity and fear which may be prejudicial to the exercise of trade union rights.
.In a more recent communication (dated  January ), the WCL referred to the assignment to forced residence of the following trade unionists: Georgina Aceituno, Juan Sepulveda, Hernn Mery and Samuel Astorga.
.In its communication of  February the Government states that these measures of assignment were taken by virtue of the special powers conferred on the President of the Republic by Decree No.  of , in conformity with the Constitution of . They do not amount to penal sanctions. The powers thus conferred on the President of the Republic are subject to the control of the courts. The Court of Appeal of Santiago has been seized of appeals lodged by persons affected. The court confirmed the powers of the President and the measures taken. The court, however, decided that the Government should not have fixed the place of residence of those persons in the province to which they were assigned. They themselves had the right to choose their place of residence within that province. All the persons concerned had chosen to settle in Arica.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government concerning this matter. It notes, however, that the Government does not state the precise reason for which the measures in question were taken. The Committee would like to request the Government to provide information in this connection.
.The WFTU had alleged that a number of trade union officials had been harassed in connection with their activities on the occasion of May Day . These officials, who had signed a document entitled ""Analysis and Aspirations of Chilean Workers after  Months of Military Government"" (submitted to the Government on May Day), stated that after that date ""overt, illegal and abusive pressure"" had been brought to bear on the leaders who had associated themselves with this document. Submissions under the amparo procedure had been filed by some officials whose organisations were signatories to the document; they had been followed by vehicles and by persons in civilian clothes; the premises of their organisations or their homes were being kept under surveillance; some of them had received a series of anonymous telephone calls. The WFTU mentioned the names of the following officials: Hctor Hugo Cuevas Salvador, Fernando Bobadilla Pisani, Ricardo Celedonio Lecaros Gonzlez and Sergio de Jests Villalobos.
.The WFTU also referred to the Government's refusal to allow the celebration of May Day  to be organised by  trade union organisations.
.In the absence of any reply from the Government concerning these various allegations, the Governing Body requested it in November  to forward its comments on these matters as speedily as possible.
.In its letter of  January , the Government stated that the trade union organisations had celebrated May Day in  with a combined mass demonstration in which the most important Chilean Confederations, federations, associations and unions had taken part.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied fuller information on these aspects of the case. It wishes to emphasise that the holding of public meetings and the voicing of demands",0,1975,Chile
213,"might be involved in the disappearances. In these conditions, the Committee must keenly regret that the inquiries undertaken by the judicial bodies were not able to clarify the circumstances of these disappearances. It would like to be kept informed of any subsequent developments in the procedures under way.
.The Committee takes note of the observations supplied by the Government on the placing under house arrest, detention and sentencing of the persons mentioned by the complainants. It notes that the reply conflicts with the allegations since the complainants claim that these various measures are related to the trade union activities of the persons concerned whereas the Government states that they are the consequence of breaking the law, disturbing the peace or engaging in subversive activities. The Committee however must observe that in most of the cases the Government has not supplied, in support of its statements, detailed information about the precise facts for which the persons mentioned by the complainants are blamed.
.Regarding the placing of persons under house arrest, the Committee notes that a number of such measures were taken as a result of a demonstration organised on May Day, which is traditionally a day of trade union action. It also observes that these procedures, to which the Government resorted on several occasions, are of an administrative nature, i.e. without any safeguard for the rights of the defence.
.In addition, the Committee notes that court proceedings have been brought against various leaders of national federations, at the instigation of the Ministry of the Interior, for having acted as representatives of other persons without the authorisation to do so or as representatives of unregistered organisations while some have been acquitted, others have on the contrary been given suspended prison sentences. In the Committee's view, such action can only be detrimental to the return to normal trade union life. Furthermore, the Committee cannot help but see a link between these cases and the difficulties imposed by the legislation for establishing and maintaining in existence federations and Confederations.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that Mr. Alvaro Seplveda was released three days after his arrest and that the cases concerning Mr. Guzmn and Mr. Bustos, who are now released on bail, are continuing before the courts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adopt the present interim report, in particular the following conclusions;The Committee takes note of the information collected by the ILO mission which visited Chile in December .As regards the trade union legislation, the Committee regrets that in the absence of the Minister of Labour, the findings arrived at by the mission could not be the subject of a true exchange of views with the government authorities and that they were unable to indicate whether amendments or a change in government policy on trade union matters could be contemplated. It nevertheless trusts that the necessary legislative amendments will be introduced shortly with a view to more effective application of the principles of freedom of association and hence greater social justice. With this in mind, the Committee wishes to underline the interest which organisations of employers and workers have in consultation during the preparation and application of legislation which affects their interests. It requests the Government to keep it informed of any subsequent developments concerning the trade union legislation.The Committee must also recall that application of a normal judicial procedure is essential in cases where trade union organisations are dissolved, a procedure which was not observed in the case of seven federations and Confederations dissolved in . The Committee notes that the new trade union legislation provides that workers' organisations can only be dissolved by judicial means and that this procedure was followed in the case of the trade union of the Santiago Union Club.Regarding the dismissals of trade unionists, the Committee wishes to stress the importance of effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination. As regards more specifically the dismissals in the public sector, the Committee considers that the lack of legal recognition of the trade union rights of government employees can only encourage the adoption of measures prejudicial to the leaders of de facto organisations existing in this sector. Consequently, it requests the Government to take measures to permit the reinstatement of the dismissed trade unionists.Concerning the disappearance and arrest of trade unionists, the Committee must observe that no new elements have been produced in the cases concerning missing trade unionists or former trade unionists. The Committee keenly regrets that the inquiries undertaken by the judicial bodies have not been able to clarify the circumstances of these disappearances. It requests the Government to keep it informed of any subsequent development in the procedures under way.As regards the placing of persons under house arrest, the Committee must point out that these measures, some of which were taken as a result of May Day celebrations, are of an administrative nature and consequently the rights of the defence are not safeguarded.The Committee also considers that the proceedings brought by the Ministry of the Interior against the leaders of national federations can only be detrimental to a return to normal trade union life.It requests the Government to supply information on the results of the court cases instituted against Mr. Guzmn and Mr. Bustos.
.The last time the Committee examined this case was at its November  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Shortly before and since this last examination of this case, the Committee received new communications from the following complainant organisations: the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAN) ( October ), the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers (UISTAFP) ( November  and  April ), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) ( December ,  and  April ), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers ( December  and  February ), the Permanent Congress of Trade Union. Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) ( December  and  April ), the Miners' Trade Unions -international (WFTU) ( December ), the International Federation of Teachers' Unions (IFTU) ( December ), the Trade Unions International of Transport Workers (UIST) ( December ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) ( December ,  and  January,  and  March, ,  and  April and  and  May ), the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees ( April ), World Confederation of Labour ( and  May ). The Government sent its observations in communications dated  February,  April, and ,  and  May .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (no. ).
.On  June  the Government published several legislative decrees concerning trade union rights and the right to collective bargaining, in particular Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  of which the Committee took note at its November  Session. At that time, the Committee made comments on these texts, particularly on the following points: formation of trade unions, acquisition of legal personality, trade union by-laws, conditions of eligibility of leaders, supervision of trade union funds, prohibition of intervention in partisan political activities, setting up of federations and Confederations, trade union rights of public officials, field of application and level of collective bargaining, and the right to strike.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, decided:(i) to note with satisfaction the abrogation of Legislative decree No.  which had been adopted in. December  and which imposed serious restrictions on trade union activities;(ii) to note that the promulgation of the legislative decrees on trade union organisations and collective bargaining constituted an important first step in the application of the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(iii) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations expressed by the Committee in relation to certain provisions of this legislation which are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association and collective bargaining with a view to introducing the necessary amendments;(iv) to express the hope that the legislation will be thus applied in a spirit conforming to the principles of freedom of association and with respect for civil rights, the importance of which had been stressed by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission;(v) to request the Government to forward information on the implementation of the recommendations mentioned in subparagraph (iii) above and to continue to supply information on the practical application of the legislative decrees.
.It its communication dated  February , the Government states that certain technical amendments have been made to the legislation on trade union organisations and collective bargaining by Legislative Decree No. , published in the Official Journal on  November . The amendments to Legislative Decree No.  concerning collective bargaining include the introduction of details on matters to be governed by collective agreements, the grant of the right to negotiate to trade union management, the elimination of the necessity of having legal personality to administer welfare schemes. In addition, for one",0,1975,Chile
214,"have brought the question of dismissal before the tribunals, which have not yet handed down their judgement.
.Generally, the Committee considers it desirable to recall at the present time, due to the large number of allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists, the importance which it attaches to effective protection against acts of anti-union discrimination. It notes that the dismissals which took place at CODELCO, a division of El Teniente, are subject to judicial proceedings, and it would accordingly like to be kept informed of the outcome. The Committee would also like to have the Government's observations on the new allegations of dismissals mentioned above.
.It various stages in the examination of the case, the Committee has examined allegations concerning the detention and disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists in a report examined by the Committee in November , the Government gave information concerning  out of  persons mentioned in the list drawn up by the Committee in its th Report. In March , the Government pointed out that the Santiago Court of Appeal had delegated one of its judges to discharge the special mission of considering the cases of those persons presumed to have disappeared while on trial before one of the tribunals of the Santiago Court of Appeal district. These cases concerned  of the persons mentioned in the complaints.
.In a communication of October , the ICFTU stated that  corpses bearing signs of torture had been discovered near the Yumbel cemetery. According to statements of the inhabitants of this area, the bodies had been buried at the end of October . A large deployment of military forces and police had been seen at the time in the area. The ICFTU stated that two of the bodies had been identified as trade union leaders from the paper industry at Laja.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, asked the Government to continue to supply information on the outcome of the proceedings under way and, in general, on the persons mentioned in the list drawn up by the Committee in its th Report, and to provide its observations on the ICFTU's new allegations.
.In various communications several complainant organisations refer to repression against seven leaders of trade union federations whose indictment the Government had requested through the ministry of the Interior. These leaders had, in the names of their organisations, stated in writing that the competent authorities should return to their relatives the bodies of the persons found at Lomqun.
.In its communication of  November  the Trade Unions International of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation workers gives details of this affair. It explains that the bodies of  peasants who were members of the Confederation ""Ranquil"" had been found last year in an abandoned lime-kiln, at Lomqun, close to Santiago. According to the complainant organisation, the eight policemen guilty of these murders had benefited from the amnesty law and are at liberty. It adds that the bodies have been buried in a common grave instead of being returned to their relatives. The seven trade union leaders had then addressed a letter to the Minister of the Interior concerning this case. The complainant organisation states that the Ministry of the Interior's request for indictment of these persons was rejected by the investigating judge. The UISTAFP adds that on  September  the police arrested  persons accused of disturbing public order, following a mass celebrated in the Santiago cathedral in memory of the  assassinated peasants.
.The Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers alleges in its letter of  February  that one of the seven arrested leaders, Fernando Bobadilla, President of the National Federation of Textile and Clothing Workers, was sentenced on  January  to  days' imprisonment.
.In its communication of  January , the ICFTU mentions the arrest of Victor Muoz, a leader of the trade union ""Textile Sumar"". This person is said to have been accused of ""extra-union activities"" contrary to the law.
.In its communications of  and  March , the ICFTU states that it has also been informed that the celebration of Women's International Day organised on  March  by the National Trade Union Co-ordination was violently put down by the authorities. According to the complainant organisation, the police made more than  arrests in Santiago and Valparaiso. Those arrested are said to be kept in secret not in the usual places of detention or have been placed under house arrest in areas known to be the least comfortable. The ICFTU supplies a list of  persons so dealt with by a decision of the Minister of the Interior made under Legislative Decree No. .
.The allegations made by the external Committee of the Sole Central of Chilean Workers in the document sent by the WFTU and the ICFTU also mentions the arrest of three workers of the Good Year company in Santiago during a peaceful demonstration organised when a dispute was going on in the undertaking.
.Numerous communications from complainant organisations concern the arrest of trade union leaders accused of organising demonstrations for May Day. The complainants give the following names: Humberto Vergara, Herman Navarro, Alfonso Hernandez, Carlos Ulloa, Carlos Morales (leader of the United Federation of Peasants and Workers) and Juan Jara (president of the Taxi Trade union).
.In this regard, the ICFTU explains in its letter of  April  that only government-organised celebrations for May Day had been authorised. The WCL alleges that police intervention during a demonstration organised by the Workers' Unitary Front on May Day caused four serious fire-arm woundings and the arrest of  workers. In addition, the ICFTU alleges that  workers were sentenced on  May last for having provoked disorder and for having incited violence by distributing pamphlets and by organising a demonstration on May Day in the north of the country. Lastly, the ICFTU in its communication of  May  refers to the arrest of Adolfo Poblete Caldern in the Talca region.
.In its reply of  April , the Government states that regarding the seven trade union leaders arrested following their inquiries regarding the discovery of the bodies at Lomqun, the Minister of the interior transmitted the case to the Santiago Court of Appeal so that it should decide whether those concerned had, in fact, committed a crime under the law. The Tribunal considered that there were sufficient reasons as regards two of them, Fernando Bobadilla and Alomiro Guzmn. The others were set free. On  January , the Public Prosecutor requested a prison sentence for the two men concerned for having acted as agents of other persons without possessing the legal personality to do so. The Government points out that the reasons behind the legal proceedings are not linked to trade union activities.
.Regarding Victor Manuel Muoz Espinoza, who was mentioned in an ICFTU communication, the Government states that he was arrested on  December  for having distributed subversive pamphlets in a public place and for having in his possession a false identity card. The investigating magistrate of the Court of Santiago considered that there were grounds to convict, and ordered his imprisonment. The defence lawyer did not request provisional release. Recently, the Public Prosecutor again requested a prison sentence. Regarding the ICFTU allegation, the Government states that Victor Manuel Muoz is not amongst the leaders of the  trade unions at the Sumar S.A. undertaking.
.Regarding the disturbances which took place during the celebrations for Women's international Day, the Government explains that about  persons demonstrated in a non-authorised public place and provoked disturbances, defying the police who were controlling the traffic and causing violations of public and private property. A total of  men and  women were arrested,  of whom were students,  workers,  mothers of families and  of no known occupation. All the women were set free after  minutes as were  other persons. Eight persons were placed under house arrest in the environs of Valparaiso with freedom of movement within the city.
.As for the events which took place on May Day, the Government points out that Carlos Morales, Alfonso Hernandez and Herman Navarro were arrested for having provoked disorder in a public place paralysing vehicular traffic. They were set free the same day. One of the persons mentioned by the complainants, namely Juan Jara, was brought before the Santiago court on charges of defamation and libel. He has been free on bail since  April, and, if he is convicted, he may be granted a conditional suspension of his sentence.
.As regards Adolfo Poblete Caldern, the Government states that this person was arrested on  May  and was immediately brought before the Talca courts. He is accused of having infringed the provisions of the Act on internal security of the State. He has not been held in secret and he has chosen a defence lawyer.
.The Committee notes with concern that, since it last examined this case in November , it has received numerous complaints regarding the arrest of",0,1975,Chile
215,"year after the entry into force of the Legislative Decree, all previously existing trade unions are entitled to bargain collectively even if the number of their members or the percentage of workers they represent in the undertaking is less than that required by the law. The determination of the minimum percentage of workers necessary for collective bargaining is also amended. This percentage is now fixed in relation to the total number of workers who are the subject of the negotiations, and no longer with regard to the total number of wage earners in the undertaking.
.In both its communications of  February and  April , the Government supplies various statistical information concerning concluded collective agreements, strikes that have been called and trade union organisations that have been set up. In the light of this information, it therefore appears that between.  August  and  March , workers have presented , draft collective agreements and , new agreements have been signed. From  October  to  March ,  strikes concerning more than , workers and of an average length of . days have been recorded. The only recourse to compulsory arbitration occurred at the National Electricity undertaking. During the last  months, more than  trade unions, and one Confederation covering  trade unions and  federations, have been set up.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that Legislative Decree No.  introducing some amendments to the labour legislation was adopted on  May . It mainly deals with technical changes to the Act on trade union organisations. In particular the Government mentions in this regard the provisions on special contributions which can be collected under the check-off system, the facilities granted to trade union leaders, the extension of trade union rights in agriculture, staff delegates, collective bargaining and employer organisations.
.The Government also states that regarding the setting up and supervision of trade unions, measures have been adopted with a view to limiting the role previously given to administrative bodies of the State. In fact, from now on there is a possibility of appeal before the courts as regards faults in the establishment of trade unions as found by the Labour Inspectorate. Moreover, the powers of the Labour Direction with regard to supervision have been limited. The Labour Direction no longer has the possibility to freeze current accounts, and in the case of irregularities constituting crimes, it must bring a complaint before the courts.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government regarding the application of the new legislation as well as the amendments made to the Legislative Decrees promulgated in June . In particular, it notes with interest that certain amendments introduce the possibility of judicial appeal against administrative decisions, as regards the establishment of trade unions. However, the Committee must note with regret that most of the provisions concerning the points recalled in paragraph  above regarding which it made comments when it examined the legislation, have not yet been amended. It expresses the firm hope that the necessary amendments will be introduced in the near future in light of the principles of freedom of association and the recommendations made by the Committee. Moreover, the Committee would like to ask the Government to keep it informed of any development in the matter.
.At its previous sessions, the Committee examined the allegations concerning the dismissal on  March  of Daniel Lillo, President of the National Association of Customs Employees of Valparaiso. This measure was taken by the Regional Governor (intendente) of the Valparaiso region in accordance with Legislative Decree No.  of . This legislative decree empowers intendentes and governors to demand the resignation of members of the executive Committees of certain types of associations, in particular of workers' organisations in the public sector, on the ground of serious impediments to the functioning of that organisation, and to appoint replacements. If the person concerned does not resign within the stated time limit, the intendente or governor issues a decree removing the person concerned from his position as a leader of the organisation. In the present case, the Government claims that Mr. Lillo had given to the press a false account of a meeting which he had not attended. The Government stated later that Mr. Lillo had been temporarily suspended from his employment.
.At its November  Session the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, had drawn the Government's attention to certain principles concerning the importance of protection against acts of anti-union discrimination and had asked it to indicate whether Legislative Decree No.  had been repealed as far as workers' organisations in the public sector were concerned.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that various government bodies are presently studying the reform of the law on public officers. The new legislation which will establish a definitive system of association of state employees will replace the interim standards contained in Legislative Decree No. . The Government adds that its philosophy is against interference by the authorities in the associations, and aims at reaffirming their liberty and autonomy.
.It appears from the information supplied by the Government that Legislative Decree No. , in pursuance of which Daniel Lillo was removed from office, is still in force. Consequently, the Committee must recall that the provisions of this Legislative Decree allowing removal of leaders from associations of public sector workers by administrative authorities are not in conformity with the principles of freedom of association. It must urge that these provisions be repealed. In addition, the Committee hopes that the legislation concerning organisations of workers in the public sector which is presently under study will repeal the provisions in, question, and, morn generally, that it will accord trade union rights to public officers.
.In its communication of  January , the ICFTU refers to violations of trace union rights said to have been committed by the Chilean authorities against four workers of the Copper Company of Chile (CODELCO), a division of El Teniente. The ICFTU appended to its letter a communication from the National Group for Defence of Trade Union Rights.
.It is stated in this communication that four workers of the CODELCO undertaking, a division of El Teniente, were elected members of the Financial Control Commission of the industrial union of Rancagua. This election took place following a vote of censure against the former commission which was guilty, along with the present trade union leadership, of embezzlement of trade union funds.
.The communication states that the new commission has successfully carried out a detailed study which has permitted the discovery of illegal manoeuvres by the trade union leadership with the agreement, the collusion or the indifference of state bodies.;
.The communication also states that the present trade union leadership has obstructed the activities of the Financial Control Commission although the former has the sole responsibility for the illegal and unconstitutional management of these funds. The complicity of state officials is explained, according to the communication, by political reasons. It is added that the trade union leaders who are responsible for this situation are in favour of the Government, which protects them. In spite of pressure and threats the members of the Control Commission continued their investigations.
.This provoked reactions from the Government and from the public undertaking CODELCO, which on  October  dismissed the four members of the Commission. The undertaking based these measures on section  of Act No. , which concerns dismissals for reasons connected with the functioning of the undertaking, the establishment or the service. The directorate of the undertaking replied to requests for explanations that there had been ""orders from above"". It is stated in the communication that in this manner, the Government of Chile, acting both as public authority and as employer, intervened to the prejudice of members of the union, and interfered in purely trade union questions.
.The documentation sent by the WFTU and the ICFTU on  and  April  also mentions measures of dismissal taken against leaders of various trade union organisations: the Industrial Trade Union of Copper Mines in Chuquicamata, the Post and Telegraph Association of Concepcin and the Textile Workers' Union ""Andina"". Moreover,  workers of the CTI undertaking are said to have been dismissed as a reprisal following a -day legal strike held in December .
.In its communication of  April , the Government refers to the dismissal of workers who were said to be elected members of the Financial Control commission of the industrial union of Rancagua (CODELCO), a division of El Teniente. The Government explains that these persons put forward their nomination to this commission during a meeting of the union held on  March . However, in the minutes of the meeting there is no trace of their election. Nevertheless they assumed these functions in actual fact, and requested from the works management control of the accounts of the union. In the end, after a complaint against the union, the works management had to put the case before the competent criminal judge. In addition, the workers concerned",0,1975,Chile
216,"sentence of three years and a day for forging sales documents.
.As concerns the persons mentioned in the complaints relating to the present case, the Government repeated that most of these persons had not been arrested and had in all probability disappeared of their own volition, going underground after receiving instructions to that effect. It added that disappearances like these took place in accordance with organised plans for which the Government could not be held responsible.
.With regard.to the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, the Government repeated the information already communicated in its previous report to the effect that the Valparaiso criminal court had undertaken an inquiry into the matter. The investigations had been suspended by the court on  February  ""until further information comes to light"".
.The Committee must note with deep regret that the Government has not supplied any new information concerning the alleged arrest or disappearance of the many persons named in the complaints relating to the present case. The Committee has, however, been informed that following the submission of new evidence to substantiate the claim that these persons were arrested, the Supreme Court has decided to reopen the inquiry into, in particular, the disappearance of  serving or former trade union officials named in those complaints which have come before the Committee. The Committee expresses the hope that the resumed investigations with respect to these persons will be carried out diligently and in full independence. More generally, as concerns all the allegations of disappearances that have been brought to its attention, the Committee urges the Government to carry out thorough inquiries into these cases, in respect of most of which the complainants have supplied additional information, including eye-witness accounts, to substantiate their claim that the persons in question were arrested.
.The Government has likewise failed to reply to the allegations made since the Committee's last session concerning the temporary arrest of certain trade union officials (Eduardo Berrios Morales, Samuel Astorga and Ramn Velasquez) and attempts to intimidate others (Hector Hugo Cuevas Salvador, Fernando Bobadilla Pisani, Ricardo Celedonio Lecaros Gonzlez and Sergio de Jess Villalobos) and concerning the detention of Carlos Contreras Maluje. The Committee would like to have the Government's observations on these allegations.
.The Committee further notes with regret that the recommendations for the continuance of the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn do not appear to have been complied with. The Committee considers that the witnesses' testimony compiled by the Ad Hoc Working Group established by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights of the Organisation of American States' suffices to show the need for reopening the inquiry into this matter and continuing it until the person or persons responsible are found.
.The WFTU and the WCL had alleged that an armed group had raided the premises of the National Association of Public Employees (ANEF). The complainant organisations added that the Vice-President of the ANEF, Milenka Mikovilovic, had been brutally assaulted on this occasion.
.The Government had stated that criminal proceedings had been initiated in this case in the courts of Santiago. In addition, the Minister of the Interior had requested the Director-General of the Investigation Service to ensure that the inquiries reached a satisfactory conclusion as speedily as possible.
.At its May  Session the Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to intensify the investigations into the case and to communicate the findings.
.In its report of  September , the Government repeats the information already provided in its previous reports.
.The Committee regrets that no new information has been provided on this matter. It emphasises that a climate of violence, symptomised by acts such as that committed against the premises of the ANEF, may constitute serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights and that such occurrences call for severe measures on the part of the authorities.
.In its communication of  May , the ICFTU stated that the Government had deprived of their nationality Messrs. Luis Meneses, General Secretary of the Single Central Organisation of Chilean Workers (CUT), and Humberto Elgueta and Ernesto Araneda, members of the External Committee of the CUT. The WFTU made the same allegations in a telegram dated  May .
.The Government has not yet furnished its observations on this matter.
.The Committee wishes to request the Government to forward its comments as speedily as possible concerning these allegations, and concerning, in particular, the reasons which prompted the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from the trade union officials in question.
.In its telegram of  May , the WFTU referred to the Government's refusal to authorise the celebration of May Day as requested by.  trade union organisations.
.The Government has not yet furnished its observations on this matter.
.In general terms, the Committee recalls that the right to organise public meetings on the occasion of May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights. The Committee wishes to request the Government for its comments on these allegations.
.In these circumstances, with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest that other persons named in the report of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission have been released;(b) to note, however, with deep regret that the Government has not supplied any new information concerning the alleged arrest or disappearance of the many persons named more recently by the complainants;(c) to request the Government once again to carry out thorough inquiries into the cases of disappearance and to supply information on the situation of the persons named in the list annexed to the present case;(d) to request the Government to ask the competent authorities to continue the inquiry into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Roman with a view to finding the person or persons responsible;(e) to draw the Government's attention to the observations made in paragraph  above concerning the raiding of the premises of the ANEF;(f) to request the Government to forward as speedily as possible its comments on such a grave act as the withdrawal of Chilean nationality from trade union officials in exile;(g) to request the Government also to forward as speedily as possible its comments on the allegations relating to the temporary arrest of Messrs. Eduardo Berrios, Samuel Astorga and Ramn Velasquez, the attempts to intimidate Messrs. Hector Cuevas; Fernando Bobadilla, Ricardo Lecaros and Sergio de Jess Villalobos, and the refusal to authorise the celebration of May Day by certain trade union organisations;(h) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  November .

.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, in accordance with the decision adopted by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ), the Government of Chile has submitted a further report on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association;(b) to urge the Government to promulgate as soon as possible new trade union legislation, thereby giving effect to its stated intention to do so, and to repeal Legislative Decree No.  in order to ensure the normal functioning of trade union activities;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above with respect to trade union elections;(d) to note with interest the changes contemplated in the system of tripartite Committees, and to express the hope that they will constitute a step towards the full re-establishment of free collective bargaining;(e) to remind the Government that the Committee still requires information concerning the Ranquil Confederation and the United Confederation of Workers and Peasants in order to be able to assess the present situation of these organisations, as well as information concerning the measures taken to grant legal personality to the FIEMC and the FENATEX.(f) to request the Government to supply information on the situation of the ANESE;(g) with regard to the questions relating to human rights, to note that the allegations referring to the arrest or disappearance of certain persons are being examined within the context of Case No. ;(h) to request the Government to continue to supply information on the evolution of the situation with respect to the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and to submit a report on this subject by  October .

.The allegations outstanding concern the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists, the financing of agricultural trade union organisations and the raiding of trade union premises.
.In these circumstances, and regarding the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the allegations concerning the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists:(i) to note that some of the persons mentioned by the complainants as having disappeared are at liberty in the country; others, however, have left the country;(ii) to remind the Government that it has not yet transmitted information on a large number of persons;(iii) to",0,1975,Chile

.The allegations still outstanding in this case concern the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists or former trade unionists and the financing of agricultural trade union organisations. In addition, further allegations have been made concerning a raid on premises belonging to a trade union.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations concerning the arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists(i) to note the information supplied by the Government particularly as concerns the release of most of the persons about whom it has furnished information;(ii) to note, however, that the Government has not supplied any information about many of the persons on the lists forwarded to it since the Committee's last session;(iii) to express once again its concern as regards the allegations that trade unionists have disappeared after being arrested, at the same time noting that several of the persons mentioned by the complainants as having disappeared have, according to information supplied by the Government, left the country, to request the Government to indicate whether further investigations are being made into the cases of other persons alleged to have disappeared, and, if so, to communicate the findings;(iv) to note that a judicial inquiry is being conducted into the death of Marta Lidia Ugarte Romn, and to request the Government to communicate its findings;(v) to request the Government to take the necessary steps to communicate all the information still awaited by  April ;(vi) to point out that the forced exile of trade unionists cannot be considered to be equivalent to release since it is not only in violation of human rights but also in violation of the principles of freedom of association, particularly when it deprives trade union organisations of their freely elected leaders;(b) as regards the financing of agricultural trade union organisationsto draw the Government's attention to the remarks made in paragraph  above and to express the hope that the Government will continue seeking ways of offsetting the loss of resources suffered by the workers' agricultural organisations and, in particular, ways of facilitating the collection of trade union dues;(c) as regards the raid on the premises of the ANEFto note that criminal proceedings have been initiated in this connection and to request the Government to communicate the findings as soon as they are made known;(d) to take note of the present interim report.

.The complaints and additional information supplied by the complainants were submitted in the following communications: a communication of  August  from the Trade Unions International of Workers of the Building, Wood and Building Materials Industries (UITBB); four communications, of  August,  October (received on  November),  November  and  February , from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU); two communications, of  August  and  January , from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL); a communication of  November  from the Trade Unions International Federation of Agricultural, Forestry and Plantation Workers; a communication of  November  from the Trade Unions International Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers; three communications, of  November and  December  and  January , from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU); two communications of  December  and  February  from the World Federation of Teachers' Unions.

.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).

219,"the courts. Of the six persons mentioned, only two (Manoel Jos Constantino and Jos Ferreira da Silva) had been members of a union at the time of their short detention; they had been acquitted. The Government repeated that there was no link between the facts mentioned in the complaint and trade union rights.
.The Government then referred to the allegations regarding the death of Vladimir Herzog and Manoel Fiel Filho during their detention for interrogation with regard to subversive activities. It described in detail the investigations carried out after these two deaths and stated that the experts had arrived at the conclusion that the persons in question had committed suicide in prison without having been incited or helped. These conclusions had been transmitted to the judicial authorities, who had ordered the cases to be filed. Vladimir Herzog, added the Government, although a member of a union had never held union office; he had been arrested for activities prejudicial to national security. Regarding the arrest of Manoel Fiel Filho, this had no connection with the exercise of trade union rights.
.According to the Government, the persons mentioned in the complaints, with the exception of Manoel Jos Constantino and Jos Ferreira da Silva, had no connection with the trade union movement at the time of their arrest or sentence. They were performing no functions at that time in the administration of the unions, were not militant trade unionists and had not been arrested for trade union activities. Consequently, the Government considers that the Committee is not called upon to consider these matters since its competence extends only to specific cases of violation of freedom of association.
.The Committee wishes to point out that it has frequently examined complaints concerning the detention of former trade union leaders with a view, particularly, to determining on the basis of all the available information, whether the measures taken against them were not related to their previous trade union activities. In the present case, several of the persons mentioned had previously held trade union office. At the same time, the Committee has always considered that when persons are sentenced on grounds having nothing to do with the exercise of trade union rights, the matter lies outside it terms of reference. It nevertheless has an obligation to check for itself, on the basis of all the information available, whether these persons were sentenced for acts covered by penal law or for trade union activities.
.In the case under consideration, the Committee notes in particular that Manoel Jos Constantino and Jos Ferreira da Silva were acquitted by the courts for lack of proof, after several weeks' detention during the last quarter of .
.Regarding Joao Massena Melo and Osvaldo Pacheco, it seems clear that these persons had held no trade union office for a long time. Regarding Manoel Conceicao dos Santos, the information available shows that he had formed a peasants' union with a membership of around , in the north-east of the country, which had mainly participated in the occupation of land. On his release from prison in  he had sought to become a normal member of society by working as cabinet-maker in the south of the country. He had attended a seminar on active non-violence and had been arrested shortly after the meeting. Moreover, the information available does not make it possible to conclude whether Vladimir Herzog and Manoel Fiel Filho had performed activities or held office in a trade union. It consequently does not seem to appear from the information available to the Committee that the persons mentioned in this paragraph were arrested or sentenced for trade union activities.
.Regarding Jos Duarte, the Committee notes that the Government does not reply to the allegations made by the complainants to the effect that he had been a union leader on the railways in the north of the country.
.The Committee must also point out that it has before it allegations and public information to the effect that some of the persons mentioned in the complaint were subjected to ill-treatment. It notes that the Government's detailed rely in this connection is limited to the allegations concerning the deaths of Vladimir Herzog and Manoel Fiel Filho. The Committee has also noted certain contradictions between the information provided by the complainants and that provided by the Government. In particular, according to the complainants, Joao Massena Melo and Jos Duarte have been under arrest since the beginning of  and since , respectively (in the latter case, the WFTU even indicated the prison in which the person concerned is said to be held), but according to the Government these persons have fled or are in hiding.
.With regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest that Manoel Jos Constantino and Jos Ferreira were acquitted by the courts;(b) to decide, for the various reasons set out in paragraph  above, no purpose would be served in continuing its examination of the allegations in respect of Joao Massena Melo, Osvaldo Pacheco, Manoel Conceicao dos Santos, Vladimir Herzog and Manoel Fiel Filho;(c) to request the Government to provide information on the facts which led to the indictment against Jos Duarte in ;(d) to take note of this interim report.",0,1975,Brazil
220,"trade union leaders and militants. In its reply, the Government supplies information on seven of the leaders listed by the complainants, whose arrests, the Government claims, were not linked to trade union activities. It appears from the information that four of them were brought before the courts, and that the three others, who were arrested on May Day, were released that same day.
.In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall that in numerous cases where the complainants allege that workers or trade union leaders have been arrested because of their trade union activities, and where the government's replies simply deny the allegations or claim that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for crimes under ordinary law, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further information as precise as possible concerning the arrests, particularly in connection with the legal or judicial proceedings instituted as a result thereof and the result of such proceedings in order to be able to make a proper examination of the allegation. The Committee accordingly would like to receive detailed information on the results of the judicial proceedings undertaken against these four persons.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government on the demonstrations organised on Women's International Day. In particular, it notes that the persons arrested were released but that eight of them have been placed under house arrest. It appears that these measures were taken by the administrative authorities. In this connection, the Committee wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the right of all accused persons to enjoy the benefits of normal judicial procedures in these circumstances, the Committee considers that the persons arrested during a demonstration organised by a trade union, such as the one which is the subject of the allegations, should be released or, if they are accused of crimes, be judged by independent and impartial courts.
.As regards the arrests which took place on May Day, the Committee wishes to point out as it has done on several occasions and particularly in connection with this case that the right to organise public meetings and processions on May Day constitutes an important aspect of trade union rights, provided the legal provisions on public order are observed.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet sent its observations of the allegations concerning the discovery of the bodies of two trade union leaders near Yumbel, the arrests which took place during a demonstration by the workers of the Good Year company, as well as on the incidents which took place on May Day and the sentencing of workers in the north of the country. The Committee finally notes that the Government has not supplied new information since May  concerning the inquiries undertaken as regards the disappearances of trade unionists or former trade unionists.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the new trade union legislation,(i) to note the information supplied by the Government regarding the application of the new legislation as well as the amendments made to the Legislative Decrees promulgated in June ;(ii) to note, in particular, with interest that certain amendments introduce the possibility of judicial appeal against administrative decisions, as regards the establishment of trade unions;(iii) to note with regret that most of the provisions which gave rise to comments by the Committee have not yet been amended;(iv) to express the firm hope that the necessary amendments will be introduced in the near future in light of the Principles of freedom of association and the recommendations made by the Committee in its th Report;(v) to ask the Government to keep the Committee informed of any development in the matter;(b) regarding the removal from office of Mr. Daniel Lillo,(i) to point out that the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  are not in conformity with the principles of freedom of association and to urge that these provisions be repealed;(ii) to express the firm hope that the legislation relating to organisations of workers in the public sector which is presently under study will accord trade union rights to this category of worker;(c) as regards the dissolution of trade union organisations,(i) to point out that the procedure followed for the dissolution of seven organisations in October  is not in conformity with the principle according to which workers' organisations must not be dissolved by administrative authority and to draw the attention of the Government to the principle expressed in paragraph  above concerning the devolution of the assets of the dissolved organisations;(ii) to ask the Government to supply its observations on the dissolution of the trade union of the Santiago Union Club;(d) as regards the dismissal of trade unionists, to ask the Government to supply information on the results of the judicial proceedings brought by the dismissed workers of CODELCO, a division of El Teniente, as well as on the new allegations listed in paragraph  above;(e) regarding the allegations concerning civil liberties,(i) to express its concern over the number of allegations relating to the arrest of trade union leaders and militants;(ii) to ask the Government to supply its observations on the allegations mentioned in paragraphs  to  above, and, in particular, on any current judicial proceedings, especially concerning the cases of Mr. Fernando Bobadilla, Alomiro Guzmn, Victor Muoz and Juan Jara;(iii) also to ask the Government to supply its observations on the allegations made by the ICFTU in. October  (see paragraph  above) and information on the persons who the complainants allege to have disappeared or be detained and whose names appear in the Annex;(iv) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above concerning the arrests made during demonstrations organised on women's International Day and May Day;(f) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee last examined this case at its May  session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since then, the international Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) has addressed, on  August , a communication to the ILO on the new trade union legislation promulgated by the Chilean Government. Furthermore, the Professional Trade Union of Seafarers of Chile and the Port Workers' Trade Union have presented a complaint by telegram on  September  and the ICFTU sent new allegations in a letter of  October . For its part the Government provided its observations in communications dated  and  October .
.Chile has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its report submitted to the Governing Body in May  the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association, which had been entrusted with the examination of the case of Chile, had recommended to the Government the adoption without delay of new trade union legislation which, in order to be in conformity with the principles of freedom of association enshrined in the ILO Constitution and in order to enable the ratification, as the Government stated was envisaged, of the freedom of association Conventions, which contain very clear provisions on this question, should recognise the following principles:
.In the course of the various stages of the Government's work on the elaboration of a draft law on trade union organisations, the Committee has strongly urged the Government to promulgate without delay legislation which will guarantee the free exercise of trade union rights. On all these occasions, it has repeatedly recalled the principles set forth by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association in the perspective of the adoption of this legislation.
.At its session of May , the Committee took note of the Government's statements regarding the promulgation of new trade union legislation, which was expected for  June  at the latest. In addition, the Committee examined the guidelines of the new legislation, the text of which had been communicated by the Government. It noted with interest that, in the form in which they had bean communicated to the Committee, they appeared to have largely incorporated the principles endorsed by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association in its recommendations concerning the adoption of new trade union legislation. Nevertheless, the Committee reaffirmed that it could not pronounce itself on the question of the conformity or otherwise of the new legislation with the principles of freedom of association until it had all the necessary information at its disposal, and in particular, the full text of the new provisions. In this respect, it expressed its deep regret at the fact that the Government had not been able to supply the text of the draft law before it was finally promulgated. In these circumstances, the Committee could only urge the Government to take the necessary measures to ensure that the new legislation to be adopted by  June  should contain provisions conforming with the recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation",0,1975,Chile
221,"Commission and that the text should be speedily forwarded to the Committee so that it could make a pronouncement on its conformity or otherwise with the principles of freedom of association. Furthermore, the Committee considered it useful to reiterate the need for a full and speedy application of legislation conforming to the above-mentioned recommendations with a view to bringing to an end all the restrictions which have been in force in trade union matters for the last six years.
.The Government promulgated on  June  a number of legislative decrees concerning trade unions and collective bargaining, viz. Legislative Decree No.  which lays down Constitutional rules in the social field, Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  which lay down rules on trade union organisation and on professional associations respectively and Legislative Decree No.  on collective bargaining.
.In a communication dated  August , the ICFTU declares that Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  constitute grave violations of freedom of association. As far as Legislative Decree No.  is concerned, the ICFTU mentions more specifically the following provisions: articles  and  (minimum number of workers required to set up a trade union); article  (supervision of the legality of the Constitutions by the Labour Inspectorate); article  (majority necessary for the approval of the Constitutions); articles , , , , , ,  and  (rules governing elections); article  (termination of office of trade union leaders); Title VI (financial management of trade unions); article  (dissolution of trade unions); articles  to  (federations and Confederations).
.In its communication of  October , the Government: firstly gives a general picture of the substantive aspects of the legislation on trade union organisations, then it specifically replies to the ICFTU's allegations.
.The Government states that the series of standards, adopted under the ""Social Plan"" are aimed at enabling the free exercise of trade union rights by yet a greater number of workers. Trade union organisations now may be established and acquire legal personality through an ""automatic"" procedure which does not require the public authorities' authorisation. The Government notes that this is the first time that this procedure has been applied in Chile. It points out that shortly after the publication of the Legislative Decree many trade unions were established (a list of them is provided) as well as a saltpetre workers' Confederation. In this regard, in its communication of  October , it states that between  July and  September ,  new trade unions were formed covering , members.
.As a consequence of the new Legislative Decree, the Government must accord the same legal treatment to all workers. It notes that the previous Labour code discriminated between intellectual and manual workers; in fact the latter were obliged to affiliate in one sole trade union. The Government also points out that the Legislative Decree applies to all workers in the private sector and in state-owned undertakings and that it allows for a whole range of possible trade union structures (unions in undertakings, unions covering several undertakings or self-employed workers' unions).
.Under the provisions of the new Legislative Decree, continues the Government, organisations should enjoy internal democracy and union autonomy. The number of trade union leaders who should benefit from ""union protection"" has been increased and they are allowed time off to carry out their activities during working hours. The Government states that this did not exist in the previous Code. In order to increase trade union autonomy, important changes have been introduced. The Government states that organisations are no longer obliged to deposit their funds in the State Bank and unions of less than  members no longer need necessarily present an annual financial statement.
.The Government also points out that fines of up to , US dollars are provided for in cases where acts of anti-union discrimination are proven. To this end, the concept of unfair practices has been introduced. Moreover, the Government states that the system of trade union dissolution has undergone considerable amendment since the competence previously invested in the executive has been transferred to judicial tribunals.
.The Government considers that the new provisions evidence notable progress, both as regards the previous Labour Code of  and in light of the international standards and principles on the subject. Although the previous legislation may have openly violated the letter and spirit of Convention No. , Chile was never accused at that time of infringements of freedom of association. The Government draws attention to the fact that now this is no longer the case as it has corrected all the imperfections which previously existed.
.According to the Government it is not a question of an absolute analysis of the conformity of the ""Social Plan"" with the Conventions which it has not ratified. It is only advisable, so it states, to evaluate the new legislation by comparing it with recommendations of the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission.
.The Committee has taken cognizance of Legislative Decree No.  it notes with satisfaction that the new legislation abrogates Legislative Decree No.  which had been adopted in December , shortly after the change of regime, and which imposed serious restrictions on trade union activities. While welcoming this abrogation, which had been urged by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission and by the Committee itself, the Committee must nevertheless make certain comments on some of the provisions of the new legislation, in the light of the principles of freedom of association.
.Certain allegations have been formulated on the subject of Title II of Legislative Decree No.  concerning the setting up of trade unions. The Committee notes that articles  and  require a minimum number of members for the setting up of a trade union ( workers representing at least  per cent of the total staff for a trade union in an undertaking;  workers representing  per cent of the staff for a works union; nevertheless, whatever their percentage,  workers can set up a trade union; similarly,  workers representing  per cent of the staff in the case of undertakings employing less than  workers or  workers for a multi-company union) in this regard, the Government states that these provisions correspond to Chilean tradition and to the general opinion of Chilean workers. According to the Government, the establishment of trade unions in small undertakings is not prohibited since the workers concerned can, in particular, set up organisations covering several undertakings. Moreover, it gives examples of unions which have been set up within small workplaces since the promulgation of the legislation.
.The Committee observes that the Labour Code which was previously in force in Chile required, for the creation of an industrial trade union, the consent of  per cent of the workers of the undertaking concerned and, for a professional trade union, a minimum of  members. The new legislation thus appears to contain more flexible provisions on this point. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that, in the case of a large undertaking, the minimum number of workers required for setting up a trade union, can be very high since it must represent  per cent of the total staff and can thus be as high as  wage-earners. In the present case, the Committee is not in a position to determine whether the application of the provisions in question will give rise to problems in practice. It wishes, however, to recall in respect of large undertakings the view which it has already expressed, according to which the setting up of a trade union can be hindered considerably or even be made impossible when the law specifies for a trade union a minimum number of members which is patently too high.
.Under article , the trade union is endowed with legal personality from the moment its Constitution is deposited with the authorities. Nevertheless, under the terms of article , the labour inspection has  days to file objections to the setting up of a trade union in the case where the formalities prescribed by law have not been performed or the Constitution does not conform with the relevant legislation. The trade union then has  days in which to take the necessary steps. In the contrary event, the legal personality is considered as cancelled by mere operation of the law. In this regard the Government states that therefore for the first time in Chile trade unions can be set up automatically.
.The Committee has always considered that the formalities prescribed by national legislation for the setting up of trade unions are admissible provided, of course, that the provisions in question do not run counter to the principles of freedom of association and that the approval of the Constitution, in particular, is not left to the discretionary powers of the administrative authorities. In the present instance, it would be desirable in particular that the decision of the labour inspectorate, and any cancellation of the legal personality which might result therefore, should be capable of being challenged in court so that the latter can re-examine the merits of the case.
.Article  of the Legislative",0,1975,Chile
222,"Decree (Title III relating to rules) specifies that rules must be approved at the constituent meeting of a trade union by an absolute majority of its members voting by secret and nominative ballot. The Government considers that this is not a restriction on the organisations' freedom in this connection, the Committee wishes to refer to a number of earlier cases in which it has been able to observe that in a number of countries, both the law and the practice require the majority of the members of a trade union - at least on the first ballot - to decide on certain questions which affect the very existence of the trade union (approval and amendment of the Constitution, dissolution, etc.). The Committee has considered that, in such cases, the legal provisions on the necessary majorities do not constitute an intervention contrary to freedom of association, provided that such regulation is not calculated to hinder seriously the running of a trade union, by rendering the adoption of decisions virtually impossible in the present case, it is not clear whether the members of a trade union, including a trade union which groups members working in several different places in the same country, must vote in person at one and the same voting assembly.
.Title IV relating to boards of management lays down a certain number of rules concerning the number of officers (article ), the requirements for eligibility (article ) and electoral procedures (articles  to ). According to the Government, the provisions of this Title have modernised the standards of the previous Code without creating restrictions. The Committee must recall on this point that legislation which makes detailed provision for election procedures within a trade union or for the composition of its executive bodies is not consistent with the right of organisations to freely elect their representatives.
.As far as the requirements for eligibility specified by the Legislative Decree are concerned, the Committee has noted with interest that certain provisions adopted in the course of the organisation of the October  elections, and which it had considered incompatible with the principles of freedom of association, have not been taken up in the new legislation (for example, the prohibition of re-election of officers and the requirements that officers should undertake not to engage in political activities). Nevertheless, the Legislative Decree maintains as a requirement for eligibility the absence of convictions or prosecutions for crimes or mere misdemeanours as well as, in the case of a works union, the requirement of two years' service with the same firm. As for ineligibility because of criminal convictions or prosecutions, the Committee is of the opinion that such a provision can run counter to the principles of freedom of association. In reality, the fact that a person has been convicted - and a fortiori in the case of a mere prosecution - for an activity which, by its very nature, is not calculated to represent a real threat to the proper discharge of trade union functions, should not constitute grounds for disqualification from nomination as an officer of a union. A mere prosecution which results in discharge of the case should not be taken into account in this connection. Similarly, the seniority requirement in the undertaking negates the right of free election; the dismissal of a trade union leader could, in such a case, make him lose also his position as a trade union leader, and thus deprive the organisation of its freedom of action and affect its right to elect freely its representatives and even favour acts of interference on the part of the employer. Furthermore, it appears from article  that the nomination of candidates is not contemplated, contrary to a practice which is very common among trade union organisations.
.In Title VI, relating to trade union funds, article  specifies that the Directorate of Labour, which has in the matter the widest right of inspection and which can act either on its own initiative or at the request of the parties, has access to the account books of the trade union. Trade union executives must submit in due time all economic, financial, accounting or patrimonial data that might be requested by the Labour Directorate if, within  days, the trade union leaders have not complied with these requests, the leaders are deposed from office by the mere operation of the law and may not be re-elected for a period of three years. The Government states generally regarding Title VI of the Legislative Decree that Chilean law has never granted such wide freedoms to trade unions.
.The Committee has repeatedly stressed the importance which it attaches to the right of trade unions to organise themselves, their activities and the administration of their affairs. As the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has underlined, in its General Survey on Freedom of Association and Collective Bargaining published in , the supervision exercised by the public authorities over trade union finances should not normally exceed the obligation to submit periodic reporting requirements. Inspection and furnishing of information wherever required by the authorities at their discretion entail a danger of interference in the internal administration of trade unions. Investigations should be limited to exceptional cases when they are justified by special circumstances, such as apparent irregularities revealed by the presentation of annual financial statements or complaints by members of the trade union. Furthermore, the general principle concerning the judicial control of internal acts of an occupational organisation in order to ensure an impartial and objective procedure is particularly relevant in regard to the administration of trade union property and finances. In the present case, the Committee draws these principles to the attention of the Government with particular emphasis because of the grave consequences which could result for a trade union if it does not apply the Legislative Decree on these questions, to wit the removal of the trade union leaders concerned from office and their ineligibility for a period of three years.
.In the same context of the right of trade unions to organise their administration and their activities, the Committee pointed out that article (b) of Legislative Decree No. , amending Constitutional Act No. , prohibits the participation of trade union organisations in partisan political activities. The Committee wishes to recall in this respect the comments made by the Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on Freedom of Association in its report. The Commission considered that a general prohibition of political activities undertaken by the trade unions to promote their specific objectives would be contrary to the principle of freedom of association. The Commission went on to say that however, if the unions, in accordance with the wishes of their members, undertake activities of this kind, it is important that such activities should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuity of the trade union movement or its social and economic functions, irrespective of political changes in the country. Governments, for their part, should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for pursuing political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of trade unions because of their freely established relationship with a political party.
.Certain allegations have been formulated concerning Title VII of Legislative Decree No.  (relating to the dissolution of trade unions) which specifies that such dissolution shall take place by judicial order (article ) and that application for it can be made by the Labour Directorate, by a trade union member, by an employer or by any other interested person (article ). The Committee considers that these provisions do not conflict with the principle according to which trade unions must not be liable to dissolution by administrative order. It notes that, on the contrary, these provisions evidence progress with respect to the Labour Code of  which made provision for the dissolution of trade unions by decree.
.Title VIII of Legislative Decree concerning federations and Confederations aims, according to the Government, at defining higher-level organisations. However, it contains certain provisions which, in the opinion of the Committee, are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. This is the case, in particular, of articles  and  which define respectively a federation as an association of more than  but less than  trade unions and a Confederation as an association of not less than  trade unions or federations, of article  which forbids federations and Confederations from participating in collective bargaining and from signing a collective agreement and of article  according to which the affiliation of a trade union to a federation or Confederation must be renewed by a general meeting every two years.
.The Committee has also observed that most of the provisions applicable to trade unions in matters of Constitution, articles of association, elections and union assets, are likewise applicable to federations and Confederations. The comments made above by the Committee on these matters are similarly applicable to these higher-level organisations which must also have the right to draft their articles of association, to",0,1975,Chile
223,"elect freely their representatives, to organise their administration and their activities and to formulate their programme of action.
.According to article  of the Legislative Decree (Title I% concerning the supervision of trade union organisations), all trade unions, federations and Confederations are subject to the control of the Directorate of Labour and must supply to the latter all the information which it requests. The Committee considers that this provision gives the administrative authorities the right to investigate at their discretion the internal affairs of a trade union and accordingly comports a risk of interference in the administration of the organisation concerned.
.As for the scope of application of the Legislative Decree, the Committee observed that its provisions are not applicable to officials employed by state bodies - centralised or decentralised (article ). The Committee wishes to recall in this respect that public officials, like workers of the private sector, should be able to set up organisations to promote and defend the occupational interests of their members. The Committee notes that the Legislative Decree is applicable to the workers of the agricultural sector who were formerly covered by a special law of , and to copper workers who were previously covered by a special regulation.
.Finally, the Committee pointed out, with regard to the transitional provisions of the Legislative Decree, that the trade union officers elected in October  pursuant to the provisions of Legislative Decree No.  of  will remain in office for a period of four years (transitional article No. ). It appears, however, that the workers will have the right to censure these officers by decision taken by an absolute majority of the members of the trade union concerned, at the request of at least  per cent of the members. While noting this last provision, the Committee wishes to recall that the Legislative Decree which governed the elections of October  contained certain provisions which are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association (these provisions concerned, in particular, the ineligibility of trade unionists holding office at the time of the elections as well as the requirement of non-participation in political activities).
.The Fact-Finding and Conciliation Commission on freedom of Association and also, on several occasions, the Committee and the Governing Body, have expressed the hope that it will soon be possible to resume the practice of collective bargaining. The Government had announced in its reports of January and May  that a new law on collective bargaining would be promulgated before  June . At its sessions of February-March and May , the Governing Body, while taking note of this declaration of the Government, had, on the recommendation of the Committee, drawn attention to certain principles, particularly with respect to the level of bargaining and the recognition of the right to strike.
.After the adoption by the Government of Legislative Decree No.  on collective bargaining, the ICFTU, in its communication of  August , claimed that certain provisions of this Legislative Decree were incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. It referred more specifically to article  (prohibition of collective bargaining at undertakings or institutions which are financed by more than  per cent by the State); to article  (prohibition of this type of bargaining with workers of more than one undertaking); to article  (prohibition of this type of bargaining for federations and Confederations) and to article  (limitation of the duration of strikes).
.In its communication of  October , the Government describes the collective bargaining system which was in force previously. It states that collective bargaining was viewed as a procedure for the obtaining of levels of remuneration as required and the redistribution of wealth without taking into consideration the workers' contributions to the undertakings or productivity. The procedure did not allow negotiations to be concluded at the level of the parties and lead to the intervention of the State. Because of this, disputes became political and required a political type of solution. This system encouraged the politisation of trade union leaders since they had to keep in contact with government officials so as to influence the solution of disputes. Moreover, the benefits won by workers were illusory. In fact, the levels of remuneration which surpassed the possibilities linked to productivity were consequently reduced by inflation.
.According to the Government, one of the most worrying questions as far as collective bargaining is concerned is the cost to the society of strikes. These factors were taken into consideration in the new legislation so as to avoid their effects. Furthermore, by allowing negotiation to take place at the level of the undertaking, disputes are localised and the seriousness of the problem and the temptation on the part of the State to interfere are reduced. Moreover, the free fixing of prices, the opening to international trade and economic policies in general have put undertakings in a situation which does not allow them to bear a dispute for a long time. Thus they cannot allow themselves to offer wages which are too low, for fear of strikes, nor too high, so as to maintain competitiveness. The balance of power between the parties, in view of one another, enables a solution to be found without the necessity of state intervention.
.The Government states that the law recognises the right to collective bargaining on all questions concerning wages and working conditions. Under the procedure, wages must effectively correspond to the specific contribution of each group of workers to the over-all output. According to the Government, this is the basic factor in the pursuance of economic progress and the correction of social injustices. Thus, continues the Government, it is advisable to place collective bargaining at the undertaking level for it is there that the contribution of each group of workers to the increase in productivity can really be measured.
.The Government goes on to describe the bargaining procedure which begins with the submission of a ""draft collective contract"" to the employer and by the election of a ""bargaining Committee"" by the means of a vote of the workers concerned. The parties bargain directly and have the right, if they so wish, to appoint a mediator. If no agreement can be reached, they can freely and voluntarily submit to arbitration. On the date of expiry of a previous collective contract, the workers may, if they have not come to an agreement with the employer, call a strike subject to the fulfilment of certain procedural rules. On the other hand, the employer may declare a lock-out, again subject to certain conditions.
.The Government states that the law provides for the maintenance of the workers' previous wage, whatever is the situation of the undertaking, taking into account a full readjustment in view of the increase in the cost of living.
.According to the Government, it is important that collective bargaining takes place between the parties without interference by the State. This can only occur where both parties have the real possibility of choice. The Government states that the ""Social Plan"" only respects this principle. It goes on to state that compulsory arbitration was not retained as a general method of arriving at collective contracts. In fact, it is of the opinion that this procedure results in the parties standing by their positions and thus makes the conclusion of direct agreements more difficult.
.However, the Government continues, in conformity with international principles, the legislation provides for the limiting or restriction of strikes in essential services or in undertakings which belong to key sectors in the society of the country. Nevertheless, the right to collective bargaining in these undertakings is not interfered with. Only as a last resort are disputes submitted to an arbitrator whose decision can be appealed before an arbitration court.
.In addition, the Government states that for the first time the legislation refers to the notion of ""unfair practices"". Therefore the refusal of an employer to bargain or to supply information in support of its contentions, physical or moral pressure against workers, the undue use of lock-outs or generally acts of bad faith which prevent the normal running of the procedure, amongst other things, are considered as interferences with the freedom to bargain collectively.
.As regards the practical application of the new Legislative Decree, the Government states that  draft collective contracts covering a total of , persons have already been submitted. It supplies a list of  undertakings in which contracts have been concluded and gives a provisional list of  undertakings where draft contracts have been prepared. Moreover, the Government states that in more than  per cent of the cases, collective bargaining has resulted in ""real"" increases in wages in the order of  to  per cent. Strikes have occurred in  per cent of cases but have only been effective in  per cent of the undertakings which were bargaining. In other cases, differences were overcome before the calling for action. At the moment, the Government states, workers in two undertakings are involved in a strike.
.The Committee notes with interest the promulgation of Legislative Decree No. ",0,1975,Chile
224,".The Committee already examined these cases in November  and in May and November ; on each occasion it submitted interim conclusions, which are to be found in its nd Report (paragraphs  to ), st Report (paragraphs  to ) and th Report (paragraphs  to ). The Governing Body approved these reports in November  and in June and November  (th, th and th Sessions), respectively. The Government handed over various documents with a bearing on the case at an interview on  June  between the Minister of Labour and the Chairman of the Committee, and supplied further information in a communication dated  July .
.Costa Rica has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.At its sessions in June and November , the Committee made certain comments in relation to the question of principle raised by the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the affairs of its employees' union. In September  the Government sent information with respect to one aspect of the question, namely the reasons for the dismissal of a trade union official.
.Recalling its conclusions in an earlier case relating to Costa Rica, the Committee pointed out that ratification of Convention No.  involved an undertaking, under the terms of Article  of that Convention, to ensure that workers' organisations in particular were provided by the legislation with the means to protect themselves against interference by employers or their organisations. Costa Rican legislation contained no specific provisions to this effect.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in June , the Governing Body urged the Government to adopt the necessary provisions without delay in a communication dated  September , the Government stated that it had taken note of these recommendations, which the Governing Body reiterated in November  when it approved paragraph  of the Committee's th Report.
.In its further observations of  July  the Government states that the alleged interference by the Costa Rican Social Security Fund in the union UNDECA never took place. Among the documents supplied is an attestation by the authorities of the Fund to the effect that an examination of the accounts for the period to which the complaint refers ( and ) shows that the Fund did not pay the travelling expenses of workers as an inducement to attend a certain trade union meeting, as has been claimed by the complainants. The Government also draws attention to the information furnished earlier to the effect that a judgement pronounced in August  had declared it not proven that Mr. Carlos Acua Castro, an official of the union, had been dismissed on account of his trade union activities. The Government supplies the text of this judgement. In addition, in letters sent to the ILO by Mr. Acuo Castro - now a Ministry of Labour official - and a number of the UNDECA officials who had signed the complaint, it is acknowledged that the facts were not as serious as was claimed in the first place.
.The Committee notes this information. It nevertheless considers that its general conclusions as to the need for legislative provisions which will protect workers' organisations against possible interference by employers are still applicable. In effect, to give the necessary publicity to provisions such as those of Article  of the Convention and ensure that full effect is given to them in practice, even in cases where ratification has the effect of incorporating the international standard in municipal law, it is highly important that these provisions, accompanied by provision for appeals and penalties to ensure that they are complied with, should be embodied explicitly in the relevant legislation. The Committee is therefore of the opinion that the recommendations already approved by the Governing Body in this respect should be maintained.
.The other matters still outstanding concern the dismissal from their jobs of three other officials of unions of employees in the public sector and the criminal proceedings brought by the authorities against two of them. These events occurred in  and . According to the allegations, Luis Fernando Alfaro Ziga, General Secretary of the Trade Union Association of Employees of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute, and Mario Devandas Brenes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Public Service workers, were dismissed from their jobs. Subsequently, according to the complainants, because of strikes called by workers belonging to their respective unions, they were charged with incitement to strike and other offences and imprisoned. The Government stated that Alfaro Ziga had made subversive speeches during a strike in July  at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and that the Public Prosecutor had charged both him and Devandas Brenes with riot, incitement to a collective stoppage of public services and conduct prejudicial to public order. Both were to be brought to trial and the court had allowed them to be released on bail.
.Bearing in mind the principles it had upheld in this connection, the Committee examined the provisions of the Labour Code which prohibit strikes in the public services and make it compulsory for any disputes between employers and workers in this sector to be referred to the labour courts. The Committee pointed out in particular that where strikes were prohibited or restricted in essential services or in the civil service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interest of the workers to the full, including in particular the existence of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties could take part at every stage and in which the awards were binding in all cases on both parties and must be fully and promptly implemented. In this connection the Government confirmed that the procedure for the peaceful settlement of disputes prescribed in the Labour Code was applicable to disputes at the Costa Rican Electricity Institute and the National Institute of Housing and Town Planning.
.On the Committee's recommendation, in November  the Governing Body requested the Government to transmit the texts of the judgements pronounced in the cases of Messrs. Alfaro Ziga and Devandas Brenes, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.The remaining dismissal involved Mr. Cristin Sobrado Chaves, General Secretary of the Union of Bank Employees of Costa Rica. He had been dismissed in February , according to the complainants, on the false pretext of unjustified absences from work. The Government stated inter alia that legal proceedings were pending in connection with this matter. In November  the Committee and the Governing Body drew attention to the importance of a rapid procedure for examining alleged cases of dismissal because of trade union activities. The Government was requested to supply the text of the judgement handed down in the case relating to the dismissal of Mr. Sobrado Chaves.
.The documents and observations communicated by the Government on  June and  July  include the texts of the judgements requested. As concerns Mr. Devandas Brenes, it is stated in the judgements pronounced by the labour court and the Higher Labour Court in September and October  that he was discharged on  March  by the institute of Housing and Town Planning together with other workers, as part of a retrenchment of staff rendered necessary by financial difficulties. The judges considered it proven that Mr. Devandas Brenes had been dismissed for this reason and not arbitrarily or as a means of anti-union persecution, and that the employer had obtained authorisation in advance from an advisory board as required by the collective agreement. As regards Mr. Alfaro Ziga, the judgements, likewise of first and second instance, pronounced in March and May  state that he was dismissed in February  by the Costa Rican Electricity Institute. The union had filed a complaint with the Legislative Assembly against the authorities of the Institute, accusing them of corruption and mismanagement. The Assembly set up a commission of inquiry. Later the union executive had a statement published in the press accusing the authorities of the institute of anti-union persecution. The latter enjoined Mr. Alfaro Ziga to substantiate some of the charges made, which he did not do himself, but left it to the union, whereupon he was dismissed. The court considered that the dismissal was justified, observing, inter alia, that while the union was a separate legal entity from its members, this fact did not exonerate Mr. Alfaro Ziga from his responsibilities as an employee in his relations with his employer. According to the court, the statement published by the union was based on charges made personally by this employee, who did not substantiate them as instructed by his employer, and was thus guilty of dishonesty and disloyalty. The court considered that there was just cause for dismissal on the ground of serious non-compliance with the obligations deriving from a contract of employment as specified in the Labour Code.
.The Government also supplies information concerning the criminal proceedings initiated in  against Messrs. Devandas Brenes and Alfaro Ziga on charges of riot",1,1975,Costa Rica
225,"attitude favoured or discriminated against one or more trade union organisations: examples of such allegations are pressure exerted on workers by means of public statements made by the authorities, unequal distribution of subsidies among unions or the granting to one union, rather than to the other, of premises for holding its meetings or carrying on its activities, and refusal to recognise the leaders of certain organisations in their legitimate activities.& Discrimination by these means or others may be an informal way of influencing the trade union membership of workers. They are therefore sometimes difficult to prove. The fact nevertheless remains, as the Committee has recalled in each of the foregoing cases, that any discrimination of this kind jeopardises the right of workers to set up and join organisations of their own choosing, a right which is explicitly recognised in Article  of Convention No. .
.The Committee also wishes to lay stress on the principles set forth in the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th Session (). The fundamental and permanent mission of the trade union movement, states the resolution, is the economic and social advancement of the workers. When trade unions in accordance with the national law and practice of their respective countries and at the decision of their members decide to establish relations with a political party or to undertake Constitutional political action as a means towards the advancement of their economic and social objectives, such political relations or actions should not be of such a nature as to compromise the continuance of a trade union movement or its social or economic functions irrespective of political changes in the country. The resolution also stresses that governments should not attempt to transform the trade union movement into an instrument for the pursuance of political aims, nor should they attempt to interfere with the normal functions of a trade union movement because of its freely established relationship with a political party.
.Allegations concerning the registration and cancellation of registration of trade unions
.The representative of the Director-General explained that a resolution, No. / of  October , repealed resolutions of  which, by administrative decision, cancelled the registration of numerous trade unions, including the single union of workers of the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By Products mentioned in the complaints. Such registration was necessary to enable the trade unions to function. In the preamble to this new resolution it is stated, among other things, that the previous Government was guilty of actions ultra vires by assuming powers that legally belonged to the courts of first instance by virtue of section  of the Labour Code. The preamble also refers to Article  of Convention no. , which prohibits the dissolution or suspension of workers' and employers' organisations by administrative authority. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination.
.In this connection, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has observed that according to section  of the Labour Code the registration of a trade union could be refused by the Ministry of Labour. It had asked the Government whether it was possible to appeal to the courts against a refusal to register a trade union. The Under-Secretary of State told the representative of the Director-General that it was possible to appeal against a refusal to register a trade union, as it was to appeal against any administrative act.
.Allegations concerning intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions and occupation of trade union premises
.The problems raised in this connection were of two kinds. The first related to an administrative resolution, No. / of  October , issued by the Secretariat of State for Labour, according to which general assemblies organised with a view to setting up a trade union, federation or Confederation, electing its executive Committee, amending its statutes, merging with other trade unions or affiliating with a federation or Confederation, had to be ""certified"" by a labour inspector. After examining the file on the case and hearing the administration's opinion, the Secretary of state decided whether the trade union can be registered, whether its executive Committee can be recognised, and whether a merger or affiliation can take place, after having previously verified that the legal requirements have been fulfilled. The Committee expressed the view in its th Report that the obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constituted a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.The representative of the Director-General received the assurance that the resolution would shortly be repealed. The officials he talked with added that, pending the repeal, the authorities would abide by the limitations placed on this text by two rulings of the Supreme Court of Justice. According to the rulings, the powers of the Secretariat of State for Labour in trade union affairs should be interpreted restrictively and the purpose of the presence of an inspector at union assemblies could only be to provide the Secretariat with a report on the circumstances in which the assembly took place and on the decisions adopted. The Court stressed that contesting union elections was a matter for the labour tribunal and not the administrative authorities. According to officials of the CGT, says the report, while the previous Government had used this resolution to commit excesses, the present Government was not applying it in the same spirit.
.The second set of problems raised relates to factual situations: intervention by the authorities in the elections of the Stevedores' Union (POASI); manoeuvres in other undertakings, with the assistance of the authorities, to remove trade union leaders from office; confiscation and misappropriation of the funds of POASI; and occupation of its premises and those- of the National Union of Independent Drivers (UNACHOSIN). In this connection the representative of the Director-General makes the following statement in his report:With regard to the election of trade union leaders, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State declared that the Supreme Court ruling in the POASI case was a clear case of the infringement of the law by the Government of that period. They confirmed that the POASI had organised elections on  October  and was now operating normally. They also confirmed that the premises of the POASI and UNACHOSIN had been occupied but that a stop had now been put to these measures. The Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that in occupying union premises the previous Government had not respected existing legal provisions. Forcible entry is prohibited by law and misuse of power by public servants is a punishable offence under the Penal Code. As to the allegations concerning POASI funds, he said that this was now past history and that the POASI was currently verifying its financial records. If any misappropriation of funds was brought to light, the matter would be brought before the competent authorities.
.The representative of the Director-General continues:In more general terms, the Secretary of State for the Interior and for the Police informed me that meetings organised on union premises were allowed to take place unhindered and that no authorisation was required open-air meetings were another matter and did require authorisation, and the appropriate decisions were taken in the light of all relevant factors: importance of the date for the union ( May, for example), traffic problems, proximity of an important building (hospital, for example), etc.
.The Committee notes that a solution has now been found to the factual problems raised in the complaints. It also notes the intention of the Government to repeal Resolution No. / mentioned above and trusts that this measure will be taken in the near future.
.Allegations concerning interference with the right to strike
.Complaints were also made with reference to the exercise of the right to strike. In this connection, the representative of the Director-General points out, the labour authorities have recognised that it was virtually impossible to engage in strike action in the present state of the legislation. Such action could only last for a few days because judges were empowered to order a return to work. The report adds:It is significant that the Labour Code only authorises strike action within very strict limits (see sections ,  and ): for example, more than  per cent of the employees concerned must have voted in favour of the strike; a strike cannot take place if one of the parties decides to submit the dispute to arbitration; and it must come to an end upon the expiry of the legal time limit for the resumption of work ordered by the judge. The right to strike is restricted even further by the provisions governing arbitration procedure: the presiding judge can appoint the arbitrators ex officio or at the request of the Secretary of State for Labour (section ) and may order the resumption of work (section ; see also sections  to  and ). The arbitration award has the effect of a collective agreement (section",0,1976,Dominican Republic
226,"According to the Government these allegations are false. In view of the contradictory nature of these statements, the Committee can only recall the importance of the principle that trade union funds should be adequately protected.
.It appears from the allegations made that the headquarters of certain trade union organisations have been occupied by the police, in some cases several times. The latest intervention of this kind - involving the POASI - seems to have been quite recent. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the Government's attention to the fact that, in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, the International Labour Conference, expressed the view that the right to protection of the property of trade union organisations was one of the civil liberties which were essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights. While trade unions cannot claim immunity from a search of their premises, such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law and provided that such search is restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued.
.With regard to the allegations relating to interference with the right to strike, the Committee recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. The Committee points out in this connection that on several occasions the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made comments with respect to sections  to  of the Labour Code, which allow all cases of collective labour disputes to be referred to arbitration, culminating in a binding award, which might severely restrict the right to strike and thus infringe the right of trade unions to organise their activities. As concerns the calling in of the police to obstruct, according to the complainants, the exercise of the right to strike, the Committee considers that intervention by security forces in the event of strikes should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.As concerns the Government's refusal to recognise the legal existence of the Dominican Teachers' Association, the Committee refers to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations with respect to the position of public servants in the Dominican Republic, who are excluded from the Labour code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code. The Committee recalls that public servants, including teachers, are entitled to enjoy the right to organise, just as other workers are.
.A number of complaints were partly concerned with the trade union situation in the agricultural sector. This branch of activity does indeed seem to have been particularly affected by extremely serious incidents, sometimes involving the death of trade union officials. In addition, according to the complainants, the Government has prevented agricultural workers from organising themselves freely, even though their trade union rights are recognised by law. The Committee wishes in this connection to emphasise the particular importance the International Labour Conference attached to the trade union rights of rural workers in adopting the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention (No. ) in . Article  of this Convention provides that it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefrom.
.In these circumstances, as concerns the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  concerning the death, arrest, banishment and dismissal of trade unionists, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions, the occupation of trade union premises, the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers;(b) to deplore the obstructive attitude and lack of co-operation shown by the Government, which, by not consenting to a mission on the spot, and by not transmitting its replies on the questions before the Committee has made it impossible to obtain all the information on the serious allegations made and to decide what measures could be taken as regards the problems involved;(c) to decide to give wider publicity to the present report, in particular during the next session of the International Labour Conference.Geneva,  May . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.The Committee has already examined several complaints of infringements of trade union rights in the Dominican Republic, presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), the National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), the National Federation of Dockworkers, the Stevedores' Union (POASI) and the General Workers' Federation (CGT). These complaints were dealt with under Cases Nos. , , ,  and . With regard to Case No. , the Committee submitted a number of conclusions to the Governing Body that appear in paragraphs  to  of its st Report and in paragraphs  to  of its rd Report. The Committee also examined Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in its th Report (paragraphs  to ) in which it also submitted certain conclusions to the Governing Body.
.Since then, further allegations have been received in connection with these cases. They have been made by the WFTU (communication of  July ), the National Union of Telephone Workers (communications of  July  and  September ), the POASI and the CGT (joint communication of  April ) and the CGT (communication of  June ).
.The World Federation of Teachers' Unions also submitted allegations in a letter of  May  (Case No. ).
.The Government submitted certain information in a letter of  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government which recognises, in particular, that, in certain undertakings, practices exist that are not conducive to the development of healthy labour management relations and to which it cannot effectively put a stop under the legislation currently in force. New complaints have been received containing allegations that are as serious and as varied as those previously examined. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for several years been making observations on the application by the Dominican Republic of Conventions Nos.  and , which it has ratified.
.The Committee regrets the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it can examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. In paragraphs  to  of its th Report, the Committee has laid particular stress on the importance it attaches in this connection to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to urge the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director General;(b) to request the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request made above;(c) to take note of this interim report.",-1,1976,Dominican Republic
227,"and Recommendations.
.The right to form federations and Confederations
.During the direct contacts mission discussions were also held with the authorities on a restriction imposed by legislation on the right to form federations and Confederations. In this connection the representative of the Director-General writes:Finally, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations noted that Resolution No. / of the Secretariat of State for Labour requires a minimum of seven trade unions to form a federation and four federations - or three federations of craft unions - to form a Confederation. The Committee considered that these provisions restricted the right of organisations to establish federations and Confederations as provided in Article  of the Convention. The Secretary of State informed me that the purpose of this text was to avoid the proliferation of trade union federations and Confederations. However, when I explained to him the point of view of the ILO supervisory bodies on the matter as a whole, he informed me that the resolution would very shortly be repealed.
.Although this matter has not been the subject of complaints, the Committee takes note of this information, to which it draws the attention of the Committee of Experts.
.Generally speaking, the Committee notes that due to the recent change in Government there has been a favourable development in the trade union situation in the country since the complaints were presented. Although certain matters remain to be settled - in particular the question of dismissals of trade unionists and certain alleged discriminatory practices in the public sector - a solution has now been found to the other points raised by the complainants and amendments to the trade union legislation on the points raised by the Committee and the Committee of Experts are under examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists:
.Since  the Committee has been called upon to examine numerous complaints of infringement of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic, presented by the following organisations: world Confederation of Labour (WCL), world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation (CGT), National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). These complaints have been examined as Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.In these complaints allegations were made relating, inter alia, to the death, arrest and banishment of trade unionists, dismissals on account of trade union activities, the dismantling of trade union organisations, intervention by the public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions (meetings, elections, trade union funds), the occupation of trade union premises, interference with the right to strike and the trade union rights of teachers and agricultural workers.
.The subject-matter of these complaints was brought to the attention of the Government as the complaints were received. The Government provided comments on several of the allegations.
.The Committee examined Case No.  at its sessions in May and November , when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body, A further interim report was submitted by the Committee to the Governing Body with respect to Case No.  and Cases Nos. , ,  and  in May . The Committee again examined all the cases pending with regard to the Dominican Republic at its November  session 
.At its may  session the Committee observed that although the Government had submitted comments and information on several of the allegations made, the Committee possessed insufficient information to enable it to reach conclusions at that stage regarding the substance of the various issues raised. The Committee recalled, moreover, that it had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which involved allegations similar to those made in the present cases. In these circumstances, the Committee considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body, accordingly, requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General, who would report to the Committee thereon.
.No reply having been received from the Government in November  and February  the Committee invited it to give its early consideration to the request for direct contacts and to communicate its decision in this connection as soon as possible.
.In May , in the continued absence of any communication from the Government in this connection, the Committee decided to apply the special procedure provided for in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. Under this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would, on behalf of the Committee, make contact with its representatives attending the rd Session of the International Labour Conference, draw their attention to the particular cases involved and discuss with them the reasons for the delay in transmitting the observations requested. The Chairman was then to report to the Committee on the results of such contacts. However, since the Government did not designate any representative to the rd Session of the Conference, the said procedure could not be applied.
.In a letter dated  August , the Government stated that it was considering the request it had received to accept the visit of a representative of the Director-General, and added that a final reply would be given when it was in the interests of the country to do so.
.At its November  session the Committee expressed its regret at the Government's delay in acceding to the request made of it to give its consent to the visit of a representative of the Director-General. In this connection, the Committee emphasised that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if this procedure protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their part would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of co-operating with the Committee in every way so that it could examine the allegations fully and seek possible solutions to the problems involved. The Committee moreover laid particular stress on the importance it attached to the direct contacts procedure.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation,(a) urged the Government to give its consent without delay to an inquiry into the trade union situation being carried out in the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General;(b) requested the Director-General to contact the Government at the highest possible level so as to express the concern of the Committee and to insist that the Government should give a favourable response to the request for direct contacts.
.In February , the Committee noted that in spite of the reminders sent to the Government on this question the Government had not replied. The Committee deplored the fact that the Government of the Dominican Republic had shown no desire to cooperate with the procedures available in the field of trade union rights. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided that, in the event of no reply being received from the Government before its next session, wider publicity should be given to the allegations, to the replies of the Government, to the recommendations of the Committee and to the obstructive attitude of the Government's.
.Since then, no reply has been received from the Government.
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee must first of all deplore the fact that, notwithstanding the insistent and repeated requests addressed to the Government at the highest level, the Government has failed to reply to the proposal made by the Committee and the Governing Body that recourse be had to direct contacts. In view of the importance and seriousness of the matters raised in the complaints and the inadequacy of the information at its disposal, the Committee remains convinced that a visit to the Dominican Republic by a representative of the Director-General would have afforded an opportunity to gain a greater insight into the trade union situation and give fruitful consideration to possible solutions to the problems involved.
.Before taking up each of the matters raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to emphasise the importance of the cases under consideration, which raise serious issues pertaining to freedom of association and human rights in relation to trade union rights. In this connection the Committee expresses its deep concern at the acuteness and diversity of the problems faced by a substantial part of the Dominican trade union movement in a wide variety of branches of activity.
.The Committee notes in particular that, according to the allegations, certain trade union organisations, in many cases of nation-wide importance, have for many years been having great difficulty in carrying on their activities owing to the multiple obstacles that have been put in their path: arrest and dismissal of",0,1976,Dominican Republic
228,"to be a fundamental problem which was still disrupting industrial relations in the country. Although section  of the Labour Code prohibits anti-union practices, the penal sanctions imposed are fines ranging from  to  pesos ( peso  US dollar). According to the report, the Government appears willing to do everything in its power to find a solution:The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State recognise that there have been numerous dismissals and that some cases had apparently involved trade union officials. It was also possible that, in order to get rid of certain leaders, employers had dismissed a whole group of workers. The Government had tried to solve matters through conciliation and mediation and had sometimes succeeded. As it stood, however, the existing legislation did not provide it with the means to do more. Quite apart from the fact that it was difficult to find proof - a problem which is not unique to the Dominican Republic, of course - the Labour Code (section ) allows the employer to terminate a contract for an indefinite period, without giving any reason. Consequently, an employer can dismiss a worker if he finds it convenient provided he pays his employee the amounts to which he is legally entitled (corresponding to the period of notice, the leaving grant and days of leave). This applies even when a collective agreement contains a special clause providing for the protection of union officials. According to existing case law, an employer who fails to respect this provision and dismisses trade union leaders is only required to pay the special indemnity which is provided for in the event of a violation of this clause.
.The report mentions that there are at present proposals to amend the Labour Code, in particular section . The representative of the Director-General mentions the various drafts which have been prepared and adds:The President of the Republic has made a public appeal for a social truce. The representatives of the workers and employers are therefore in the process of negotiating an agreement through the Secretariat of State for Labour. One meeting was held during our mission, and the various inter-occupational Confederations whose officials I met took part in it along with the employers' associations. One of the items for discussion had to do with genuine respect for the freedom of association of workers: the employers' organisations are apparently prepared to guarantee that no trade union leader and no leader of any trade union in the process of being set up will be dismissed from their enterprises except by authorisation of an arbitration Committee. In practice, this amounts to an amendment by agreement of section  of the Labour Code. ... Moreover, it is quite feasible that, following the agreement, the matter will be brought before the Congress in the form of a Bill. The Secretary of State informed me that, even if no agreement is reached, a draft amendment to the law will be submitted on this point. Such an amendment could therefore be adopted without it being necessary to wait for the adoption of a new Labour code.
.As the Committee has already pointed out in other cases, legislation which merely prescribes that any worker dismissed without just cause is entitled in certain cases to compensation and damages in addition to the wage corresponding to the period of notice, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination, since it enables an employer, on condition that he pays the compensation prescribed by law, to dismiss any member of his staff, whether a member of a trade union or not, for trade union or other activities, the public authorities being powerless to prevent him from doing so. Protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials because, in order to be able to perform their trade union duties in full independence, they must have the guarantee that they will not be prejudiced on account of the mandate which they hold from their trade unions. This guarantee is also necessary to secure respect for the principle that workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The Dominican Government stated that it was keenly aware of the gaps in its legislation in this respect, and that it was trying to obtain a broad consensus as regards the solution to these difficulties. The Committee considers it essential that this question should be settled in the near future, given the problems which have arisen in the country.
.Allegations concerning unfair practices in the public sector
.The allegations referred to the setting up by the Government of a parallel union in Puerto de Andrs at Boca Chica (communication of August ) and a manoeuvre in the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) to make the National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT) lose its legal representative character (communication of June ).
.As regards the latter point, the representative of the Director-General wanted to assure himself that the SNTT was exercising its trade union activities fully and that it had recently concluded a collective agreement with the enterprise for the period -. The agreement contains a special clause concerning the protection of trade union officials. Except in the case of a former leader who had been suspended, this provision had been respected. However, the report mentions other cases than that referred to in the previous paragraph in which parallel unions had been set up under the former Government. In this respect the Committee had earlier recalled (in May ) the provision of Article  of Convention No. . Under this provision - as under Article  of the Labour Relations (Public Service) Convention,  (No. ), not ratified by the Dominican Republic - workers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any act of interference by employers in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour declared that the present Government would not endorse or tolerate such practices as the previous Cabinet had done, specifically in the transport sector and the sugar industry. The representative of the Director-General adds the following:In a more general vein, I raised the matter of attempts by employers to interfere in the activities of workers' organisations, and not only in the public sector. On this point the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State said that the current provisions of the Labour Code did not give the Government sufficient scope to combat such practices but that it was nevertheless its policy to try to take action on the basis of the complaints received. They added that it was the Government's attention to introduce proper provisions to put a stop to such acts of interference.The Committee notes these statements and considers it desirable, even if the Government is resolved to tolerate such practices no longer, that legal protection should be strengthened and that the Labour Code should, for example, prescribe more dissuasive sanctions for contraventions of section , the provisions of which are reproduced in the footnote.
.According to the information gathered, several union Confederations also expressed concern at the creation of the General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD) allied to the political party currently in power (PRD) because they were afraid that the new organisation would receive more favourable treatment, especially in the public sector (the State is the principal employer in certain branches of activity, such as agriculture). Dismissals had already allegedly taken place in the health sector and the sugar-cane industry. This had given rise to a fear that the dismissed workers would be replaced by others who supported the new Government. In some cases this was said to have already begun. The representative of the Director-General explains that, according to the governmental authorities he spoke to, most of the Dominican trade unions were independent of the traditional Confederations and close to the PRD; they were now able to organise themselves and were doing so within the UGTD. The report continues:The Government spokesman went on to say that the dismissals that had taken place in the public sector had not been on trade union grounds. Two points in particular should be borne in mind: in the first place, it was customary in the country to give posts in the public sector to members of the party in power (spoils system); secondly, from the economic standpoint it was necessary to cut down in personnel as the number of employees had sometimes grown far too great. They insisted that the Government would respect the right of freedom of association and ideological pluralism. In any case, legal proceedings could be undertaken against the administration if it was suspected of misuse of power.
.On more than one occasion the Committee has examined cases in which allegations were made that the public authorities had by their",-1,1976,Dominican Republic
229,".Since  the Committee has had before it numerous complaints of violation of freedom of association in the Dominican Republic. These complaints come from the following workers' organisations: World Confederation of Labour (WCL), World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF), World Federation of Teachers' Unions, General Workers' Federation, National Federation of Dockworkers, Stevedores' Union (POASI), National Union of Heavy Machinery Operators (SINOMAPE), and National Union of Telephone Workers (SNTT). They are dealt with in Cases Nos. , , , ,  and .
.The Committee examined Case No.  in May and November  and at each of these sessions presented conclusions to the Governing Body. The Committee submitted further conclusions to the Governing Body (on Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) in May . Finally, it examined all the outstanding cases relating to the Dominican Republic in November  and May .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In May  the Committee considered that the information at its disposal seemed insufficient to enable it to reach conclusions regarding the substance of the various issues raised. It had already examined, on several occasions, cases concerning the Dominican Republic which contained allegations similar to those made in the cases under examination. In these circumstances it considered that it would be very useful to apply the direct contacts procedure. The Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to consider the possibility of giving its consent to the carrying out of a study in the Dominican Republic of the facts surrounding the complaints by a representative of the Director-General.
.This request was repeated on a number of occasions. In addition, new complaints were presented which, like the earlier ones, contained a variety of serious allegations. Since no detailed reply had been received by May , the Committee had been obliged to formulate its conclusions on the cases in its th Report. However, the new Dominican Government constituted after the elections in May  accepted direct contacts by letter of  September .
.The Director-General appointed Mr. Jean-Michel Servais, an official of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, to represent him during this mission. The visit to the country took place from  to  November , and a report on the mission was submitted to the Committee. During his visit, the representative of the Director-General had conversations with the Secretary of State for Labour and the Secretary of State for the Interior and the Police, with the Under-Secretaries of State for Labour and the Under-Secretaries o?State for the Interior and for the Police, and with the Public Prosecutor of the Republic. He was also received by the President of the Supreme Court of Justice. He met the leaders of a number of trade union organisations - including those of two of the complainant organisations, CGT and POASI - on their trade union premises. Finally, he had discussions at the headquarters of the Employers' Confederation of the Dominican Republic with the officials of this organisation, and with those of the Association of Industries of the Dominican Republic.
.The Committee notes with satisfaction that the representative of the Director-General enjoyed the co-operation of all concerned. He was able to carry out all his tasks in full freedom and independence and the Dominican Government afforded him the necessary facilities to perform his mission in the best possible circumstances.
.The representative of the Director-General collected information on the various issues raised in the complaints and on the measures taken or envisaged to solve the problems encountered. At the invitation of the Government he also discussed the comments made by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations during its periodic examination of the application of Conventions Nos.  and  under article  of the ILO Constitution. All these points are examined in the paragraphs which follow.
.First of all, however, it should be pointed out that, according to the representative of the Director-General, a number of Confederations are at present contending for the allegiance of the workers and the control of the works unions. ""Thus"", he writes, ""at the time of my visit antagonism had taken a very serious turn in the Central Romana Corporations and Central Romana By-Products enterprise, a situation which seems likely to continue, if not to deteriorate further, in the coming months."" Trade union Confederations often maintain close political relations with political parties. The General Union of Dominican Workers (UGTD), which was set up very recently, is in sympathy with the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD). As will be seen later on the Government has been accused of favouring this new organisation to a certain extent. A similar preoccupation is revealed in a telegram of  December  from the General Workers' Federation (CGT), in which this organisation protests against the administrative order allegedly given by the Government to close down the programme of the ""Rutas"" radio station at La Romana and its alleged prevention of the reorganisation of the local union. This communication has been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The employers' representatives, the report continues, have expressed the view that this situation has created a tense atmosphere in industrial relations on the other hand, it appears that large numbers of unions are now being formed in the present social circumstances.
.Allegations concerning the death, arrest or banishment of trade unionists
.As the mission report states, an amnesty law was passed on  September . All the trade unionists who were mentioned as having been under arrest have now been released. In addition, the banished trade unionists have recently returned to the country under the amnesty law and after the removal of administrative obstacles to their return.
.Finally, it appears from the information gathered that under the Code of Penal Procedure any person who is detained must be brought before a judge within  hours of his arrest. In addition, an old habeas corpus Act protects individuals against arbitrary arrest. In the past, according to the Public Prosecutor of the Republic, the practice was to refer pleas of this nature to the Public Ministry ""which sometimes took rather arbitrary decisions""; this has now been changed and the pleas come before a judge of first instance. Moreover, a Hill to amend the habeas corpus Act is in preparation which stipulates explicitly that the plea must be referred to a judge and prescribes an appeals procedure. As regards banishment, the Public Prosecutor stated that, legally, such a measure could only be taken against foreigners (under the Immigration Law). No law permits the expulsion of nationals, and the measures taken by the previous Government were, in his opinion, arbitrary. There had been no more expulsions since  August .
.Legal proceedings have been instituted in respect of the two cases of murder mentioned in the complaints of the peasants' trade union leaders (Florinda Muoz Soriano in November , and Dionisio Frias in June ). The Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for Labour said that they would send detailed information regarding the judicial investigations undertaken. It was, they admitted, true that peasant leaders had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances. The new Government, they added, had stated that it would pursue a policy of respect for civil liberties and human rights, including freedom of association. The Undersecretary of State further emphasised the determination of the authorities to abide strictly by the law. The representative of the Director-General also learned from the officials of the Autonomous Confederation of Christian Trade Unions (CASC) that legal proceedings were still pending in the case of the murder of Dionisio Frias; as regards the death of Florinda Muoz Soriano the court had considered that the accused had acted in self-defence.
.The Committee notes these various items of information, in particular the release or the return from exile of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. The facts surrounding the deaths of two peasant leaders in  and  have been the subject of trials before the courts one of these cases, moreover, appears to have ended in an acquittal. The Government, while admitting that trade unionists in the rural sector had in the past met their deaths in abnormal circumstances, has stated its will to secure respect for the law and for civil liberties. In these circumstances the Committee is of the opinion that these different points call for no further consideration, provided that it is kept informed of the results of the trials in the cases of the deaths of Dioniso Frias and Florinda Muoz Soriano.
.Allegations concerning the dismissal of trade unionists
.Many allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants. According to the complainants the chief target of these dismissals were the executive Committees of the unions, but certain allegations also referred to the dissolution, or attempted dissolution, of workers' organisations. The representative of the Director-General points out in his report that this issue appeared",0,1976,Dominican Republic
230,"their leaders, occupation of their premises, interference in their internal affairs. Such an atmosphere cannot be conducive to the development of a truly free and independent trade union movement, nor to the promotion of normal industrial relations. The Committee wishes to emphasise before proceeding any further that, as stated in the resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , the absence of civil liberties removes all meaning from the concept of trade union rights, and the rights conferred upon workers' and employers' organisations must be based on respect for those civil liberties.
.The allegations refer to a considerable number of murders of officials of workers' organisations, especially in the agricultural sector, committed in most cases by employers or overseers. In the absence of any detailed information on these cases from the Government, the Committee feels bound to observe that the Government has not established that these deaths occurred for reasons unconnected with the status or activities of the officials in question. The Committee considers that, in any event, the circumstances of these cases should have prompted the authorities to take effective steps to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.Many of the complaints mention the arrest and detention of officials of various trade union organisations. Contradictory explanations as to the reasons for these measures have been given by the complainants and by the Government. According to the former they were due to trade union activities, while the latter has claimed in general terms that the officials in question were arrested for breaches of laws in respect of public order or for common-law offences.
.Be this as it may, the Committee must observe that the Government has not supplied detailed information as to the acts of which the persons arrested were accused, thus preventing the Committee from examining the allegations with all the facts before it. The Committee considers that the onus was on the Government to show that the measures it had taken were not prompted by the trade union activities of the persons concerned.
.While most of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaints appear to have now recovered their freedom, it has none the less been clearly established that some of them were kept in custody for relatively lengthy periods of time, in some cases at repeated intervals. It is impossible to determine from the Government's replies whether the persons concerned were brought before the courts. Only in a few cases does it appear from the information supplied by the complainants that legal proceedings were initiated against the trade union officials concerned. One of them was moreover kept in prison even though he had been found not guilty by a court of first instance.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge, this right being recognised in such instruments as the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee further wishes to point out that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for prosecution are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.According to the complainants, the authorities have also ordered the expulsion from the country of certain trade union officials. One of them was refused entry into the Dominican Republic on his return from an international trade union conference. In the Committee's opinion, a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is of particular gravity since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines the trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.According to the information supplied by the complainants, many trade union officials and members have been dismissed from their jobs in a large number of undertakings covering a wide range of activities. In most of these cases it has been alleged that the sole ground for the action in question was the trade union activities of the persons concerned. In some cases the underlying intention was stated to be the dismantling of trade unions, though this has been denied by the Government. The Government has however admitted that some undertakings engage in practices hardly conducive to the development of sound industrial relations which it cannot combat effectively under the legislation in force.
.The Committee considers that no person should be discriminated against on account of his trade union membership or activities, and that governments should take measures to ensure that workers are protected against acts, including dismissal, which are likely to provoke or have as their object anti-union discrimination in respect of employment. Legislation enabling employers in practice - on condition that they pay the compensation prescribed by law for cases of unjustified dismissal - to get rid of any worker, even if the true reason is his trade union membership or activities, does not give sufficient protection against acts of anti-union discrimination.
.Protection against acts of anti-union discrimination is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials, because, in order to carry out their trade union functions in full independence, they must have the assurance that they will not be victimised by virtue of their trade union office. Such an assurance is also necessary to ensure that effect is given to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom .
.A large number of trade union organisations appear to have been dismantled over the past few years, either through the withdrawal of their legal personality or through the setting up of parallel unions or through their destruction by employers. In answer to these allegations the Government has merely stated that the great majority of the organisations in question are still in existence but their leaders have been removed from office by decision of their members. The Committee does not have sufficient information to enable it to express an opinion on these matters in full knowledge of the facts. In particular, it has not been specified whether the legal personality of the trade union mentioned by the complainants was withdrawn by order of the administrative authorities or as a result of court proceedings. The Committee notes, however, that under the terms of section  of the Labour Code, the registration of a trade union may be cancelled by a decision of the courts if the trade union pursues activities not connected with its lawful objectives.
.As concerns the setting up of parallel unions and the destruction of trade unions by employers, the Committee wishes to recall that under the terms of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, workers' and employers' organisations must enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by each other or each other's agents or members in their establishment, functioning or administration. Article  specifies that acts which are designed to promote the establishment of workers' organisations under the domination of employers or employers' organisations, or to support workers' organisations by financial or other means with the object of placing such organisations under the control of employers or employers' organisations, shall be deemed to constitute acts of interference.
.The allegations of interference by public authorities in the internal affairs of trade unions are mainly concerned with the right of assembly, the right to elect officials in full freedom and trade union funds. The Committee considers that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights, and that the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The obligation to accept the presence of a representative of the authorities at general assemblies constitutes a restriction upon the free activity of trade unions.
.With regard to trade union elections, the complainants stated that rigged elections had been held in the POASI union and that the Supreme Court had ruled them to be illegal. According to more recent information supplied by the Government, properly conducted elections were subsequently held in this union. In this connection the Committee wishes once again to emphasise the importance it attaches to the principle that workers and their organisations should have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom.
.The POASI is also alleged by the complainants to have had its assets confiscated.",-1,1976,Dominican Republic
231,"). The Secretary of State adds that the judge orders the resumption of work but that, moreover, arbitrators were not appointed. The Under-Secretary told me that he knew of hardly any case where a strike had been recognised as legal. In the past the police had often intervened and an appeal to the tribunal was barely conceivable under these conditions. Nowadays, whenever a collective labour dispute arose, the Government tried to reconcile the parties; often the employers accepted to reinstate at least some of the strikers, and the police no longer intervened. However, he added that in the current period of transition he would not hesitate to apply the sections of the Labour code that empowered him to prevent a strike if he felt that public order was threatened - although this situation had not arisen.
.The representative of the Director-General referred to information according to which the party in power, the PRD, had undertaken to revise the Labour Code so as to make it more liberal; the debate on the subject had already begun in the legislative chambers. The question of the right to strike had not yet been taken up, but the Secretary of State for Labour said that he intended to propose the adoption of liberal provisions in this respect as he wanted to bring Dominican legislation fully into line with the ILO's standards and principles respecting freedom of association.
.The Committee has always considered the right to strike as one of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests it has held that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only under certain conditions, in particular in the public service and in essential services (in the strict sense of the term). In the latter cases, it has added, such restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and at which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases. Such awards should be executed rapidly and completely.
.The Committee notes the Government's intention to revise its legislation on this important question. It has also noted that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made certain observations on the present strike legislation. It would be desirable that the envisaged amendments should be adopted at an early date.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of agricultural workers
.This aspect of the case was the subject both of a complaint and of observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, which considered that the exclusion of certain rural workers from the field of application of the provisions of the Labour Code which guaranteed the right of association was incompatible with Convention No. . In this connection the representative of the Director-General states the following:When asked about this, the Secretary and Under-Secretary of State for Labour explained that under the previous regime there had in practice been a certain amount of opposition to unionisation. On the other hand, the present Government was trying to meet and encourage the participation of peasants' representatives. Under the Labour Code agricultural workers were entitled to set up trade unions. According to section , the provisions of the Code do not apply to any agricultural undertaking, agricultural undertaking of an industrial type or stock raising or forestry undertaking which does not continuously and permanently employ more than ten persons, but this refers to the undertakings themselves and not to the workers. As the Secretary of State pointed out, this means that the workers cannot set up a works union and, in fact, section  of the Code stipulates that associations of employees must have not less than  members. However, nothing prevents them from setting up an occupational ""class"" union. The government authorities I spoke to actually cited two federations that were registered with the Secretariat of State for Labour (and therefore possess juridical personality)
.The information gathered by the representative of the Director-General refers both to the de facto situation and to certain legal difficulties. From the latter point of view the authorities have provided the necessary explanations, even though it would be desirable for the Labour Code to be more explicit in recognising the right of all rural workers to form unions. It would also appear that the de facto situation has improved, and the Committee takes note of this development.
.Allegations concerning the trade union rights of teachers and public servants
.The complainants mention the specific case of a teachers' union, the Dominican Teachers' Association (ADP), which the public authorities refused to recognise. In its th Report the Committee referred to the comments of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations and expressed concern at the position of public officials and public servants in general, who are excluded from the Labour Code and thereby deprived of the trade union rights proclaimed by the Code.
.The ADP, reports the representative of the Director-General, was granted legal personality in January . Another union - the National Union of Educators (UNE) - was registered at the Secretariat of State for Labour in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code. These two organisations were theoretically for teachers from the private sector; however, according to their by-laws and, with the tacit assent of the public authorities, teachers from the public sector were also allowed to join.
.Generally speaking, public servants and other persons employed by the public authorities are excluded, with certain exceptions, from labour legislation (section  of the Labour Code, Act No.  of  July ] and are therefore deprived of the guarantees provided for therein with respect to freedom of association. Furthermore, the representative of the Director-General refers to an Act, No.  of  November , which prohibits any propaganda activity or attempt to encourage people to join trade unions within public and municipal administrations or autonomous state institutions (section ). ""According to government officials"", he writes, ""this latter provision means in effect that all trade union activity in the public sector is prohibited. Outside the public service in the strict sense, however, individual statutes do provide for the right to organise.""
.The report continues:The Secretary of State for Labour said that, although the right for public servants to join trade unions was not recognised, their right of association on the basis of Act No.  on non-profit-making associations was fully guaranteed. As early as  the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations had, however, made a number of comments on this Act, which contains provisions (for example, section  which refers to the dissolution of an association by the executive authority) whose application could constitute an infringement of Convention No. . The trade union organisations with which I had discussions were highly critical of this legislation: Act No.  permits the creation of cultural or mutual assistance associations but, according to them, not of real workers' organisations entitled, for instance, to submit claims and to negotiate collectively. Moreover, it is the Government which is responsible for registering and recognising these associations, which are not governed by the Labour Code. However, according to the UGTD, although trade union legislation would be preferable these associations do nevertheless permit workers to organise themselves and to defend their interests and they are also able to take legal action. According to the Under-Secretary of State for Labour, the Government accepts the activities of organisations set up to defend the interests of public servants. Thus, for instance, a Dominican Public Service Federation (FEDOMEPIA) has been created. The Secretary of State added that he intended to propose a new public service status which would sanction the right to organise in this sector.
.The Committee has often stressed, and particularly in two recent cases, that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category are permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests. It was also made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No.  that recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. Their special situation has, as mentioned earlier, led the Committee to admit that this right could be restricted for public servants.
.The Committee takes note of the information gathered regarding the present opportunities for state personnel to join associations for the defence of their occupational interests, and on the reforms envisaged. It nevertheless considers it essential that the right of all public servants to organise should be fully recognised in the near future, and in this connection notes that the question is the subject of an examination and observations by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions",-1,1976,Dominican Republic
232,"statements, especially as regards the temporary and emergency nature of these measures and its intention to re-establish a normal trade union situation;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs ,  and  and, in particular, to the right of these organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes, as established in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Argentina;(iii) to request the Government to indicate the measures which it intends to take or has taken in this connection and to keep the Governing Body informed of any developments in the matter; and to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case;(b) with regard to the arrest and detention of trade unionists,(i) to note that Alberto Ignacio Campos has been released;(ii) to note that Miguel Unamuno, Francisco Esquerra and Aleis Rovella have been charged with fraudulent acts and to request the Government to transmit the texts of the judgments rendered by the courts concerning these persons;(iii) to note that the  workers of the ""Ploghi SRL"" undertaking in Cordoba have been released, and to draw the attention of the Government to the principle mentioned in paragraph  with regard to the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found;(iv) to request the Government to submit further and as precise information as possible concerning all the trade unionists named by the complainants as having been arrested (including Jun Vasquez), and to draw the attention of the Government to the principle mentioned in paragraph  that all arrested persons should be subject without delay to normal judicial procedure;(c) to take note of this interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when it has received the information requested above.",0,1976,Argentina
233,"whether legal proceedings had been instituted against them and, if so, to communicate the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefor;- to provide its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody.
.The Government replied in a letter dated  September . It states that a warrant for Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan's arrest was issued on  December ; he is being charged in the ""Carlos Guillermo Braas and others"" case for contravening the aforementioned Act No. /. He is accused of involvement with a subversive group known as the military Political Organisation (OPM), which has been engaged in clandestine activities in the country. The discovery of one of its cells by the police, continues the Government, led to an armed confrontation at the beginning of April . Three members of the OPM, including Martin Roln Centurin, were wounded and later died; two police officers were also wounded. Jose Gill Ojeda Falkan is being held in Emboscada Prison. In March , he was interrogated and the report of his interrogation has been placed in his file. The Government notes that its information concerning Martin Roln Centurin derives from a report of the penal court of first instance.
.The Government goes on to say that Jos Parra Gaona, Pedro Fretez and Severo Candia Delgado were released from custody on  December ,  April  and  March , respectively. It concludes that none of the people referred to have been brought to trial for exercising trade union activities since none of them belong to any legally constituted union organisation.
.On the latter point, the Committee wishes to emphasise, as it did when it previously examined this case, that the fact that national organisations of workers have not been officially recognised is no justification for the rejection of allegations if it is clear from the complaints that these organisations have at least a de facto existence.
.The Committees notes the information supplied by the Government on the circumstances of the death of Martin Roln Centurin. It also takes note of the release from custody of Jose Parra Gaona, Pedro Fretez and Severo Candia Delgado. The fact remains, however, that Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez at least, after their arrest at the beginning of May , were imprisoned for many months without it being apparent from available information that they had been tried. Moreover, the Government has not indicated the specific acts for which they were imprisoned. Admittedly, the mere fact of carrying on a trade union activity or holding responsibilities in a trade union does not imply any immunity from ordinary penal legislation. However, unless it is duly established in a court of law that they have contravened this legislation, the prolonged detention of trade unionists is liable to appear as a hindrance to the normal operation of a union organisation and as a means of intimidating its militants and even its rank-and-file members.
.In the case of Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, too, there was considerable delay between the decision to issue a warrant for his arrest and his interrogation by a magistrate. In fact, legal proceedings against him are still pending. The Committee trusts that he will soon be judged by an ordinary court and that the Government will communicate the text of the judgement handed down and the reasons adduced therefor so that the Committee can be sure that the person concerned is not being held for legitimate union activities.
.The Government, finally, has not provided its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note with interest the release of Jos Parra Gaona, Pedro Fretez and Severo Candia Delgado, while drawing the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph ;(b) to take note with regret the incidents described by the Government in its communication which led to the death of Martin Roln Centurin; to request the Government once again to provide information concerning the situation of the brothers of Mr. Centurin and to state whether legal proceedings have been instituted against them;(c) to express the hope that Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan will soon be judged and that the Government will communicate, as soon as it is pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down and the reasons adduced therefor;(d) to request the Government once again to provide its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody;(e) to take note of this interim report.
.The complaints of the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) are contained in two letters dated respectively  July and  July . The CLAT supplied further information in communications dated  July  and  July . The WCL also provided additional information in a letter dated  August .
.The Government communicated certain observations by a letter dated  August . As authorised under the procedure, the Director-General, considering - without going into the substance of the issue - that this letter did not contain sufficient information to enable the Committee to examine the case, wrote on behalf of the Committee directly to the Government pointing out that it would be desirable for it to supply more specific information concerning the points raised by the complainants. In May , this information still not having been received despite repeated requests, the Committee appealed to the Government to supply the information requested as a matter of urgency. The Government replied by a letter dated  September .
.Paraguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The CLAT, acting on behalf of its affiliated organisation, the National Central of Urban Workers (CNTU), stated in its communications of July  that the leaders of the trade unions connected with the CLAT, as well as the peasants' movement, were being subjected to attacks and persecution. It mentioned in particular the names of the following leaders, who, it claimed, had been arrested and tortured at the beginning of may :- Emigdio Colman Nuez, General Secretary of the CNTU, arrested with his -year old son;- Oscar Vicente Rodas, leader of the urban sector, joiner, arrested with his -year old daughter and his -year old son;- Julian Flor, Jos Ojeda, Jos Parra, Fretez and other leaders of the peasants' movement.The complainant also mentioned the closing down of the John XXIII People's Institute, founded by the Christian Central of workers - now the CNTU - for the benefit of the country's youth..The CLAT also described incidents which had occurred during the same period in the town of Pedro Juan caballero, involving trade union leaders: Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln had been arrested and taken to the offices of the government delegation, where they were held for  days; Severo Delgado, an active peasants' trade unionist, was wanted by the police, who raided his house; he managed to escape to Brazil together with other persons. The CLAT expressed the opinion that the Christian inspired trade union movement was being systematically persecuted in Paraguay. It also claimed that torture was being shamelessly practised.

.The WCL also referred in its letter of  July  to the arrest on  and  May  of a number of the persons mentioned by the CLAT. It drew attention to the violence and repression being unleashed against trade unionists, especially leaders and militants in the peasants' sector. It expressed the view that a skirmish in April  between the armed forces and a group of guerrilleros had been used as a pretext for attacking any organisation working to bring about social reform and an improvement in the miserable lot of the peasants.
.The CLAT added in its letter of  July  - claiming to speak on behalf of the Christian agrarian leagues of Paraguay - that the peasants' trade union leader Martino Roln Centurin had disappeared mysteriously on  April , no doubt arrested by the National Guard. The complainants had reason to believe that he was alive and in custody at a National Guard barracks, and had been subjected to torture. He had never been charged with any offence, nor brought to trial, nor convicted. The WCL's communication of ",0,1976,Paraguay
234,"August  referred to the same facts. It specified that the person in question had been wounded on the day of his arrest while trying to defend his home. He was in solitary confinement and in a piteous state. The WCL further stated that the three brothers of Martin Roln Centurion were also in custody: Domingo at the Investigation Department (where there were torture chambers), and Melchor and Santiago, against whom legal proceedings were pending, at Emboscada Penitentiary.
.In its first communication dated  August , the Government stated that the Ministry of Justice and Labour had always upheld the rights of all workers and that the Government was ready to dialogue with lawfully established trade unions, which enjoyed guarantees in conformity with the Government's economic and social policy. The right to associate was recognised in the National Constitution, but its exercise had to be regulated by administrative rules to ensure that no harm was done to the national community. The Government went on to state that the unions cited by the complainants were totally unknown to the Ministry, with which the lawfully recognised organisations were registered. The latter would be justified in complaining to international bodies if it could be proved that their rights were being violated. Statements by illegal organisations of the kind involved in the present case - which had never been recognised, and had moreover never applied for recognition - were pure inventions submitted solely for the purpose of giving a false impression of the real situation in the country, for the furtherance of contemptible interests contrary to the general interests of the nation. At no time, added the Government, had there been any infringement of freedom of association; no genuine trade union leader, now or in the past, had ever been hindered in the performance of his functions. As for the others, the Government stated that it had no knowledge of their whereabouts and refuted the allegations made, claiming that those with a full knowledge of the facts who were active in the labour field, within the framework of the Constitution and the national law, had never mentioned having any difficulties of any kind whatsoever inside or outside their unions.
.The Government specified, in its letter of  September , that Messrs. Emigdio Colman Nuez, Julian Flor Lugo and Oscar Vicente Rodas had been arrested because they were believed to have participated in subversive activities; all three had now been released - the first two in , and the third in March . As for Messrs. Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez, they were still in Emboscada Prison, awaiting trial in the ordinary courts on charges of contravening Act No.  respecting the preservation of the public peace and personal freedom. These facts showed clearly, continued the Government, that these persons did not belong to any trade union or suchlike organisation operating lawfully in Paraguay.
.As concerns the closing down of the John XXIII Institute, the Government stated that this had been decided upon by the competent ministry because the persons in charge had failed to comply with the legal requirements with respect to the operation of intermediate-level educational institutions. The decision was based on section (c) of Decree No.  of  February , which stipulates that an establishment may not operate with less than a minimum of  pupils per course - a requirement that the institute in question was unable to meet; it was notified of the decision on  February . In conclusion, the Government repeated its statement that freedom of association prevailed in Paraguay.
.Before examining the specific allegations made in this case, the Committee wishes to recall that in determining whether or not an organisation is occupational in character it has never considered itself bound by any national definition of what constitutes an occupational organisation; it has stated, for example, that failure by an organisation to file its rules in accordance with national legislation would be no adequate reason for declaring a complaint irreceivable, since the principles of freedom of association demand that workers should not have to obtain prior authorisation before establishing organisations of their own choosing to further and defend their interests. In the present instance, the fact that the national organisations of workers cited have not been officially recognised is no justification for the rejection of the allegations - which have moreover been presented by the CLAT and by the WCL - since it is clear from the complaints that these organisations have at least a de facto existence.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government on the substance of the case. However, the Government has furnished no particulars as to the reasons for the arrest of Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln, the measures taken against Severo Delgado or the fate of Martino Roln Centurin and his brothers. Nor has it communicated its observations in reply to the allegations to the effect that a number of the trade unionists named by the complainants have been subjected to ill-treatment.
.As regards the John XXIII Institute, the complainants have not furnished evidence to prove that the closing down of this intermediate-level educational institution, as it has been defined by the Government, constituted interference with the exercise of trade union rights.
.While the Committee notes the release of Emigdio Colman Nuez, Julian Flor, Lugo and Oscar Vicente Rodas, and of Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln, it wishes nevertheless to point out, as it has done many times in the past, that the detention by authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights; the government concerned should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the dangers of detention for trade union activities.
.As concerns Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez, who are still in prison awaiting trial, the Government had not supplied any information as to the actual facts which led to their arrest. In this connection, it should be recalled, as the Committee has already done, particularly in other cases relating to Paraguay, that where complainants allege that workers or trade union leaders have been arrested for trade union activities, and the replies of the government concerned amount to general denials of the allegations or are simply to the effect that the arrests were made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for crimes under the ordinary law, the Committee follows the rule that the government concerned should be requested to submit further information, as precise as possible, about the arrests and the reasons for them; it has requested, in particular, information concerning any legal proceedings instituted and their outcome, so that it can have all the facts before it when examining the allegations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to decide, for the reasons stated in paragraph , that the allegations relating to the closing down of the John XXIII Institute do not call for further examination;(b) to note with interest the release of Emigdio Colman Nuez, Julian Flor Lugo and Oscar Vicente Rodas, and of Marcos Acosta and Luis Oscar Roln, but to recall that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve severe restrictions of trade union rights;(c) to request the Government, for the reasons stated in paragraph , to supply detailed information as to the specific acts Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jose Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez are said to have committed, and to communicate, as soon as they are pronounced, the texts of the judgements handed down in respect of these persons and the reasons adduced therefor;(d) to request the Government to supply also information as to the situation of Severo Delgado and Martino Roln Centurin, and the latter's brothers, and the specific acts of which they are accused, to state whether legal proceedings have been instituted against them and, if so, to communicate the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefor;(e) to request the Government to provide its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the alleged ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody;(f) to take note of this interim report.",0,1976,Paraguay
235,".The Committee already examined this case at its November  session, when it submitted an interim report.
.Since then, the Government has sent further comments in a communication dated  February .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) referred to the case of an official of the Metalworkers' Union, Jos Palacios, said to have been abducted in Buenos Aires on  December  by a band of masked persons as he was leaving work. The following night armed and masked persons broke into his home, taking away with them personal and trade union documents and ill-treating his wife.
.In its reply, the Government pointed out that the alleged events were supposed to have taken place on  December , or four months before the present Government came to power. It added that investigations into this case were nevertheless being made, but so far without success.
.At its November  session, the Committee recommended the Governing Body, inter alia,- to draw the Government's attention to certain principles relating to the responsibility of a government for any effects which events that had occurred under another government might continue to have since the new government came to power;- to note that the Government had had investigations made as regards the whereabouts of Jos Palacios;- to request the Government to continue these investigations and to communicate any information which might come to light concerning his fate.
.In its communication of  February , the Government stated that it had continued intensive investigations with a view to finding Jos Palacios. The Government added that the Ministry of Labour had requested the Ministry of the Interior to step up these inquiries. In a note dated  December , the latter Ministry had stated that with this end in view it had sent telegrams, but that in order to intensify its investigations it wished to have fuller information about the circumstances of this disappearance and the time and place where it occurred.
.The Government added that, despite all the efforts made by the competent authorities, it had been impossible to find Jos Palacios. However, the authorities were still endeavouring to elucidate this matter, and the Committee would immediately be informed of any new developments.
.The Committee notes that investigations with a view to finding Jos Palacios are being continued, but so far without success. It also notes that in order to intensify these investigations the government would like to have fuller information about the circumstances of Jos Palacios's disappearance. The Committee accordingly considers that it would be desirable to request the complainant organisation to supply further details concerning the circumstances of this disappearance.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern at the fact that the investigations by the authorities with a view to finding Jos Palacios have so far been unsuccessful;(b) to request the Government to inform it of any new developments in this case;(c) to request the complainant organisation to supply any further particulars it can obtain concerning the circumstances of Jos Palacios's disappearance;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.In a communication dated  January  the World Confederation of Labour presented a complaint concerning interference with the exercise of trade union rights in Argentina.
.The text of the above-mentioned communication was transmitted to the Government, which formulated its observations in a letter dated  October .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the WCL refers initially to the numerous disappearances which occur in Argentina and to the wave of violence which is a constant feature of life in the country.
.In this connection the complainant mentions the case of the leader of the Metalworkers' Union, Jos Palacios, said to have been abducted on  December  in Buenos Aires by a band of masked persons as he was leaving work. The following night armed and masked persons broke into his home, taking away with them personal and trade union documents, ill-treating his wife and threatening her with death if she did not divulge information concerning the trade union activities of her husband. This took place in the presence of the abducted man's son, who was also roughly handled.
.The WCL states that Jos Palacios is known as a most active trade unionist. He has held various trade union positions in the metal industry and been President of the Young Christian workers of Argentina. It also indicates that there has been no news of him since his disappearance and expresses fear for his life.
.In its reply, the Government, referring to the vague and ill-defined nature of the WCL's initial statements, declares that the present wave of violence in Argentina is due to terrorist action by extremist organisations which are seeking to destroy society with help from outside the country. The community as a whole and national institutions are making an effort to counter such action.
.With regard to Jos Palacios, the Government points out that the alleged events are supposed to have taken place on  December , or four months before it came to power. It adds that investigations into this case have nevertheless been carried out, but so far without success.
.The Committee has already had occasion to point out that, while a government cannot be held responsible for events which have occurred under another government, it is clearly responsible for any effects which such events may continue to have since it came to power. When there is a change of government in a country the new government should take all measures necessary to remedy any consequences which the alleged actions may continue to produce even though they took place under its predecessor.
.With respect to the disappearance of Jos Palacios, the Committee notes that all attempts to find him have so far failed.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the principles set out in paragraph  above(b) to note that the Government has had investigations made as regards the whereabouts of Jos Palacios;(c) to request the Government to continue these investigations and to communicate any information which may come to light concerning his fate;(d) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit another report when it has received the information requested.",0,1976,Argentina
236,".The complaint is contained in a communication dated  October  from Mr. Jorge Cuisana Valencia, in his stated capacity as President of the Ecuadorian Confederation of Class Organisations (CEDOC). The complainant sent additional information in a later communication of  May . The texts of the aforementioned communications were transmitted to the Government which sent its observations in letters of  February and  June .
.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In his communication of  October , the complainant stated that CEDOC, an organisation affiliated to the Latin American Central of Workers and the World Confederation of Labour, had in recent months been the victim of divisive manoeuvres led by elements extraneous to the working class. The complainant stated that a group called a meeting, to which they had given the name of congress, which was totally unrepresentative and which was attended by less than  per cent of the delegates of the organisations constituting CEDOC. Subsequently, an illegal executive, presided over by Mr. Emilio Velasco Ortega, presented itself at the ministry of Labour and Welfare and was registered by the General Directorate of that Ministry.
.The complainant concluded his communication by claiming that recognition of this union executive constituted a violation of Convention No.  as well as the resolution concerning the independence of the trade union movement adopted by the International Labour Conference in .
.In his communication of  May  the complainant forwarded various documents in support of his statements, including certification of his election to the presidency of CEDOC at the congress held in April , the records of the meetings of the CEDOC National Council held on - May  and  February , statements by various occupational and provincial federations, some of whom are affiliated to CEDOC, telegrams from the CLAT and the WCL recognising the executive headed by Mr. Cuisana Valencia, and a copy of a manifesto signed by all the occupational federations and the majority of the provincial federations refusing to attend the extraordinary congress convened at the initiative of Mr. Emilio Velasco for  and  July .
.According to the report of the meeting of the CEDOC National Council held on  and  May  a minority group consisting of persons who were not members of the Council and armed students broke into the hall and attempted to prevent the meeting from taking place normally. The police had been called in by a number of delegates to restore order, but refused to do so and scattered the workers who had gathered around the building where the meeting was being held in order to free the members of the Council A number of incidents subsequently took place in the hall. The persons from outside the Council obliged it to resume its discussions and circulated a document which they had prepared, demanding that the delegates sign it without having an opportunity to read it. Others were forced to sign a blank sheet of paper. Although they were obliged to sign this document the Council members totally rejected its contents. The armed students then exerted pressure to have the presidency of the Council given to Mr. Emilio Velasco, alleging that the President's resignation had already been accepted. Mr. Velasco began to direct the assembly, which was incomplete disorder. The students then obliged all the delegates to leave. The President, Mr. Cuisana Valencia, invited all the delegates to meet immediately on other premises. Over  per cent of the elected delegates went to that meeting and decided to approve the President's report, to refuse the resignation which he had submitted to the National Executive Committee, and to expel five members of the Executive Committee, including Mr. Emilio Velasco. The following day, the necessary quorum of  per cent having been obtained, Mr. Jorge Cuisana Valencia was confirmed in his office as National President of CEDOC.
.In its replies, the Government explained that on  April  Mr. Jorge Cuisana Valencia had freely and willingly resigned his office as President of CEDOC, because of ideological and political differences with the members of the National Executive Committee.
.On  May  the Extraordinary National Council of CEDOC had been convened by the National Executive Committee. The statutory quorum was respected at that meeting and the report submitted by Mr. Jorge Cuisana Valencia had been rejected because of its political nature. Furthermore, his resignation from the office of President of CEDOC had been accepted. The report of this assembly had been signed by all the persons present, including Mr. Jorge Cuisana Valencia.
.On the night of  to  May, Mr. Cuisana Valencia had convened and chaired another general assembly concerning which it was difficult to establish whether a quorum was obtained. This assembly confirmed Mr. Cuisana Valencia as President and expelled Mr. Emilio Velasco from his post of General Secretary.
.On  May Mr. Emilio Velasco informed the Minister of Labour that he was the new President of CEDOC, since the statutes of that organisation provide that the General Secretary replaces the President in the latter's absence. On  and  June  the National Congress of CEDOC was convened by Mr. Emilio Velasco, acting President. The  delegates who were present unanimously elected Mr. Velasco as titular President.
.The Government also supplied a list of the organisations supporting Mr. Emilio Velasco and those supporting Mr. Cuisana Valencia. On  September , it added, the head of the Department of Trade Union Organisations at the General Directorate of Labour submitted a report which was favourable to the Executive Committee chaired by Mr. Emilio Velasco. The Minister of Labour then recognised, registered and recorded the names of the members of the Executive Committee headed by Mr. Velasco, considering that all his activities as acting President were legitimate and that the National Congress at which he had been elected had been lawfully convened. In conclusion, the Government indicated that all the trade union organisations in the country belonged to one of two antagonistic groups which were in permanent conflict, producing situations which are dramatic for human relations and for the economic and social life of the country.
.The Committee notes that the present case relates to a dispute within a trade union organisation, the complainant contesting the representatively and the legitimacy of the election of the persons registered with the Minister of Labour as leaders of CEDOC. In general, the Committee considers that in such decisions the authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict the right of organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activity. The Committee considers that it is not competent to make recommendations on internal dissensions of this nature, except in cases where a government is alleged to have intervened in a manner which might affect the exercise of trade union rights and the normal operation of an organisation.
.In the present case the Committee considers that the matters at issue should be settled within the country itself with full respect for the principles of freedom of association. In this regard the Committee considers it useful to point out, as it has recently done in another case, that judicial intervention would permit a clarification of the situation from the legal point of view, for the purpose of settling the question of the leadership and representation of the trade union federation concerned. Another possible means of settlement would be to appoint an independent arbitrator to be agreed on by the parties concerned, to seek a joint solution to existing problems and, if necessary, to hold new elections. In either case, the Government should recognise the leaders designated as legal representatives of the organisation.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that the case is essentially one of internal dissension within a trade union federation;(b) to draw attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above with a view to settlement of the matters at issue, full account being taken of the right of organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom without interference by the authorities which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.",0,1976,Ecuador

.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In a telegram sent in August , the Latin American Federation of Farmworkers alleged that the Government had intervened during the Congress of the FENOC (Federation of Farmworkers of Ecuador), and that  delegates had been arrested.
.In its reply, sent in September , the Government stated that it was public knowledge in Ecuador that the FENOC had organised a subversive meeting directed against the regime. This action was deemed to be illegal by the authorities, since under the law demonstrations of a political nature jeopardising the security of the State were totally prohibited. In consequence, a number of persons had been arrested, and once penalties had been imposed upon them for breaches of public order they were immediately released.
.The Government added that it had not taken over control of any trade union organisation, and that all workers' organisations were carrying on their activities normally. According to the Government, there were splits in certain trade union associations because of ideological and political differences among their leaders.
.At its November  session, the Committee observed that the Government had not indicated the reasons why the congress organised by the FENOC had been held to be subversive. Nor had the Government specified the type of penalties imposed upon the persons arrested, nor the nature of the body which had imposed them. In this connection the Committee recalled that where trade unionists were accused of political or criminal offences which the Government considered to have no relation to their trade union functions, the persons concerned should be given a prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary.
.In these circumstances the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, noted with interest that the trade union delegates arrested were now at liberty. It also requested the Government to supply particulars as to the reasons why the FENOC Congress had been considered to be subversive, to specify the type of penalties imposed and the nature of the body which had imposed them, and to furnish the texts of the judgements handed down, if any, together with the reasons adduced therefor.
.At its sessions in May and November  the Committee had not yet received the observations and information requested from the Government. Pressing appeals were thereupon made to the Government to transmit them as a matter of urgency. The Committee further pointed out in November  that, in accordance with the procedure set out in paragraph  of its th Report and approved by the Governing Body, it might present, at its next session, a report on the substance of the matter even if the information or observations requested from the Government had not been received in the meantime.
.Since then, the Government has sent a communication dated  December  in which it merely states that it has already replied in respect of these matters and appends a copy of its letter of September .
.In these circumstances, the Committee must express its regret that, despite repeated appeals, the Government has failed to supply the detailed particulars requested of it, thus preventing the Committee and the Governing Body from examining the case in full knowledge of the facts. The Committee considers it appropriate in this connection to recall the observation it made in paragraph  of its First Report, where it stated that the purpose of the whole procedure was to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and expressed its confidence that, if it protected governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side would recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed replies to the allegations put forward.
.The Committee notes that the allegations relate to intervention by the authorities during a congress - said by the Government to be due to the subversive character of the meeting in question - and the arrest of trade union delegates on that occasion.
.In the absence of information as to the reasons why the FENOC Congress was held to be subversive, the Committee is unable to examine whether, on that occasion, the federation in question had overstepped the bounds of the basic objectives of a trade union organisation, which should be the promotion and defence of the interests of its members. The Committee wishes, however, to emphasise, as it has frequently done in the past, that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights. Freedom from government interference in the proceedings of trade union meetings is an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of the right of assembly, and the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof.
.As concerns the arrest of delegates to the Congress - who were subsequently released - the Committee has no information as to the nature of the body which imposed the penalties to which the Government has referred. The Committee feels bound to recall in this connection that the detention of trade unionists, even for reasons of internal security, may involve serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights unless attended by appropriate judicial safeguards.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its regret that, despite repeated appeals, the Government has failed to supply the detailed particulars requested of it, thus preventing the Committee and the Governing Body from examining the case in full knowledge of the facts;(b) to recall in this connection that the purpose of the Committee's procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed replies to the allegations put forward;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above with regard to the right of assembly, and to recall, in particular, that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights;(d) to point out to the Government that the detention of trade unionists, even for reasons of internal security, may involve serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights unless attended by appropriate judicial safeguards.

239,".The Committee examined this case at its February  Session when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body and requested the Government to supply certain information.
.As the Government had not sent its observations despite repeated requests to do se, the Committee decided at its May  Session to apply to this case the special procedure of contacting the government representatives during the session of the International Labour Conference. In accordance with this procedure, the Chairman of the Committee on Freedom of Association met with the minister of Labour on  June  to discuss the delay in the sending of replies. On the same day the Government sent a letter containing a partial reply.
.In the meantime, numerous complaints concerning serious allegations of violation of freedom of association were received on  March,  April,  and  June and  July  which are now the subject of Cases Nos. , ,  and . The complainants sent additional information in communications dated  June,  and  August and  September. The complaints mainly concern violent deaths, ill-treatment and arrests of trade union leaders and searches of trade union premises. These complaints have been transmitted to the Government, which has not as yet sent its observations. The Committee intends to examine these cases at its next session.
.Guatemala has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations of the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) still outstanding since the Committee's examination of the case in February  concern, on the one hand, the occupation and search by the police in June  of the headquarters of the National Central of Workers (CNT), an organisation affiliated to CLAT, and, on the other hand, the persecution of Mr. Julio Celso de Len Flores by the Guatemalan police while he was visiting Mexico on trade union business around the same time.
.At its February-March  Session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to indicate the reasons for the raid on the CNT's headquarters and whether it was carried out in pursuance of a search warrant it also requested the Government to forward its observations on the complainants' allegations concerning the persecution to which Mr. Julio Celso de Len. Flores was said to have been subjected while in Mexico on trade union business.
.In its reply dated  June , the Government states that it is unaware of the facts both as for the raid or the CNT's headquarters and the persecution to which Mr. Celso de Len Flores was said to have been subjected in Mexico, as both events are said to have taken place under a previous government. Nevertheless, it states that hr. Len Flores had been a leader of the CNT and a founder of the Christian Democratic Party but that he had been thrown out of these two organisations. The Government goes on to state that he still carries on trade union activities with another organisation and makes use of his right of freedom of expression, which is guaranteed to him in Guatemala, to fight against the draft Labour Code, particularly during lectures at the University. The Government concludes that this person is exercising his trade union activities normally without suffering any persecution or restriction on his freedom.
.In this matter, the Committee notes that the Government has supplied a reply of a general nature dated  June , but that it has not replied to the specific questions which were submitted to it.
.In these circumstances, the Committee would like to draw the Government's attention to the general principles as regards the protection of freedom of association which governs these questions.
.Thus, regarding searches of trade union premises, the Committee, while recognising that trade unions, like other associations or persons, cannot claim immunity from such an intervention, has always emphasised the importance which it attaches to the principle that such a search should only be made following the issue of a warrant by the ordinary judicial authority and only after that authority has been satisfied that reasonable grounds exist for supposing that evidence exists on the said premises material to eliciting the truth and to a prosecution for an offence under the ordinary law. In such cases, the search should be restricted to the purposes in respect of which the warrant was issued in fact, in the resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the international Labour Conference at its th Session (), the Conference expressed the view that the right to protection of trade union property was one of those civil liberties which are essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.As concerns the persecution to which Mr. Celso de Len Flores is said to have been subjected in June  whilst in Mexico, the Committee, although it is not able to comment on the merits of the allegation in full knowledge of the facts as the Government has not supplied a detailed reply on this question, would nevertheless like to recall that where a person acts as a delegate in a trade union body or at a trade union conference, he should not be worried or prejudiced because of his trade union activities.
.In any case, the complainants' allegations are old, dating from June , and the complaint has not been recently supported by additional information.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set out is paragraphs  and  above concerning the search of trade union premises and the alleged persecution of a leader while he was carrying out trade union business.
.In communications dated  and  July  respectively, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the World Confederation of Labour submitted complaints to the ILO containing allegations of infringement of trade union rights in Guatemala. These communications were transmitted to the Government for observations.
.The Government having failed to forward its observations, despite repeated requests, the Committee decided at its May  Session to apply to this case the special procedure of contacts with Government representatives during the International Labour Conference. In accordance with this procedure, the Chairman of the Committee met a Government representative on  June  to discuss with him the delay in sending replies. In the meantime the Government had sent two communications dated  May and  June . The Government has since sent a further communication dated  December .
.Guatemala has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the CLAT refers to persecution and repression allegedly suffered between  and  June  by its affiliate in Guatemala, the National Central of Workers (CNT). It claims in particular that the headquarters of this organisation was subjected to an armed attack by the police without motive or explanation.
.During this attack - continues the CLAT - a number of union officials were arrested, including Donald Castillo, a trade union official from Nicaragua, who was on a solidarity visit to Guatemala at the invitation of the CRT.
.The CLAT also refers to action taken against a union official of Guatemalan nationality, Julio Celso de Len Flores, General Secretary of the Central American Confederation of Workers, whose headquarters are in San Jos de Costa Rica. The complainant explains that while visiting his homeland the official in question was obliged to protect himself from constant persecution by the police. During this period, Julio Celso de Len Flores decided to leave on  June  for a business trip to Mexico at the invitation of the Authentic Labour Front (FAT). At Guatemala Airport his papers were carefully examined by the police and immigration authorities.
.The CLAT goes on to state that when he boarded the aeroplane, a man obviously belonging to the Guatemalan police followed him, and would not even allow him to move to another seat during the journey. The man in question, after showing his credentials to the immigration authorities at Mexico Airport, succeeded in booking into the same hotel as Julio Celso de Len Flores. A black car, with a chauffeur who looked like a policeman, was placed at his disposal on arrival at the hotel he asked to be given the room next to that occupied by the union official.
.Owing to this persecution, all Julio Celso de Len Flores could do was telephone the Authentic Labour Front, a Mexican trade union organisation. While Julio Celso de Len Flores was on the line, the man in question grabbed the telephone, and cut him off.
.After five days of virtual sequestration in this hotel in Mexico, and as a result of approaches to the Mexican Government, Julio Celso de Len Flores succeeded in getting rid of the policeman, who admitted that he had no idea why he had been asked to",0,1976,Guatemala
240,"follow him. In conclusion, the CLAT claims that the purpose of keeping this trade union official in isolation was to subject him to psychological torment and physical pressure contrary to every principle of freedom and legality.
.In its communication, the WCL refers to the same events as those described by the CLAT in its complaint.
.The Government states in its reply of  May  that Julio Celso de Len Flores was not being persecuted, but was the subject of an inquiry opened by the national police in connection with the forging of signatures. The Government explains that on  August , Miss Ana Coralia Cardenas Rangel claimed that she had been wrongfully dismissed from her employment as secretary to the legal department of the National Central of Workers of Guatemala. According to her, the person responsible for her dismissal was Mr. Len Flores, an official of that organisation. She had fallen ill and the Guatemalan Social Security Institute had instructed that she be given leave of absence from work. Taking advantage of this leave, she went to the United States for further medical examinations, and Mr. Len Flores seized this opportunity to urge her dismissal, as well as forging certain documents. The police sought to contact him in connection with these events. As they were unable to find him, the matter was referred to the first criminal magistrate's court. It also emerged that Mr. Len Flores had a record of various offences involving breaches of the peace and drunken driving.
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that Donald de Jess Castillo Orozco was arrested on  June  and brought before the th criminal magistrate's court on charges of robbery, attempted murder and illegal restraint. Since he was an alien, he was expelled from the country on  July  in the direction of Costa Rica.
.In its communication of  December , the Government merely draws attention to its two previous letters to the ILO, analysed above.
.The Committee has before it in this case two sets of allegations. On the one hand, trade union officials including a non-Guatemalan, Mr. Donald Castillo, are said to have been arrested during a raid on the headquarters of the National Central of Workers. On the other, an official of the Central American Confederation of Workers, of Guatemalan nationality, Mr. Julio Celso de Len Flores, is alleged to have been persecuted by the Guatemalan police while visiting Mexico on trade union business in June .
.According to the Government, Mr. Donald Castillo was arrested and brought before the courts for common-law offences. He was then expelled from the country because he was an alien. As concerns Mr. Julio Celso de Len Flores, the Government states that the police wished to contact him in connection with the forging of signatures. It seems that he was not found and that the matter was referred to the courts.
.While taking note of this information, the Committee is bound to observe that the Government has not indicated the reasons for the raid on the headquarters of the National Central of Workers, nor whether it was carried out in pursuance of a search warrant. Nor has the Government made any comment on the detailed allegations made by the complainants concerning the persecution to which Mr. Julio Celso de Len Flores is said to have been subjected while in Mexico on trade union business in June , or supplied any information as to the present situation of this trade union official. The Committee considers it essential that it should have information on these points so as to be able to examine the case in full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that, according to the Government, Mr. Donald Castillo was arrested and prosecuted for common-law offences and expelled from the country in view of his status as an alien;(b) to request the Government to indicate the reasons for the raid on the headquarters of the National Central of Workers and whether it was carried out in pursuance of a search warrant;(c) to request the Government to forward its observations on the allegations concerning the persecution to which Mr. Julio Celso de Len Flores is said to have been subjected while in Mexico on trade union business in June , and to supply information as concerns the present situation of this person;(d) to take note of this interim report.",0,1976,Guatemala
241,".The Committee previously examined this case at its November  Session, when it submitted an interim report.
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation alleged essentially that its national and local leaders had been persecuted, arrested and imprisoned by the Government.
.In its reply the Government explained that following a study of the situation in the public fishmeal and oil production enterprise Pesca Per it had adopted Legislative Decree No. , under which the State continued to process and market anchovies but left the fishing to small private undertakings, composed of former Pesca Per workers, or to other undertakings in the private sector.
.However, continued the Government, a group of persons and certain trade union leaders of the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation, in an effort to slow down the country's economic recovery, brought pressure to bear on the workers to prevent them from complying with the provisions of the Legislative Decree. Moreover, on  October , they persuaded some crews to start an untimely strike accompanied by acts of terrorism against the non-striking fishermen. These acts took place in Lima, Callao, Huacho, Supe and Chincha. Following investigations, an order was issued for the arrest of the suspected persons. The persons involved were Luis Arce Boya, Marcos Bejarano, Abelardo Ojeda and two other persons. The Government explained that these measures were not directed against the trade union representatives on account of their union activities, but solely for punishable acts. Only five persons had been arrested, and once the investigations were completed they were released. The Government added that no person was at that time being held in connection with this case.
.The Committee noted these releases and reminded the Government that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists regarding whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may restrict freedom of association.
.The Committee also noted the publication in the official journal of an order, No. -- n  of  November , by which the Ministry of Labour had withdrawn representative status: from the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation leaders vis--vis the state administrations and the public and non-public bodies. The reasons for this decision included, in particular, the statement that the strike launched by these leaders was illegal under the state of emergency and that terrorist acts had been committed against persons and private property.
.The Committee considered that such measures adopted by the administrative authorities created problems with regard to Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Peru, according to which workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and the public authorities must refrain from any interference which restricts this right or impedes the lawful exercise thereof in these circumstances the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, drew the attention of the Government to the terms of this Article and invited it to submit its comments concerning the withdrawal of representative status from the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation leaders.
.The Government sent its comments on this point in a communication of  May .
.In this communication the Government confirms that the administrative labour authority withdrew representative status from the leaders of the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation by Order No.  of  November . The reasons for this decision were set forth in an official communication, No. // of  November , which referred to acts of coercion and violent aggression against the freedom of the fishermen, the resort to strike pickets and incitement to acts of terrorism against persons and private property on the initiative of the leaders of the Federation. The official communication also points out that the work stoppage which the officials attempted to impose on the rank and file had taken place at a time of national crisis and emergency, in clear violation of the laws prohibiting work stoppages and go-slows; it accordingly constituted an act of overt provocation. The withdrawal of the representative status of the leaders of the Federation was confirmed by Order No. //, the plea of nullity having been disallowed.
.However, the Government explains that it was in no way its intention to refuse to recognise the trade union organisations and the right of the workers to elect their representatives in full freedom. Accordingly, following the convening of the National Plenary Assembly of Fishery Workers on  and  April  and the appointment of a National Executive Committee by that Assembly, the administrative labour authority registered that Committee by Order No. //, thereby expressly confirming the representative status of the leaders of the Fishermen's Federation.
.By a communication of  October , the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation submitted a complaint containing allegations of infringements of trade union rights in Peru. The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which submitted its comments in a letter dated  June .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint, the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation stated that by Legislative Decree No.  of  July , the Government ordered the transfer of the fleet of the enterprise Pesca Per to small private firms. According to the complainants, these measures deprived the fishermen of their right to work and of the social benefits and advantages they had struggled to obtain, particularly that of security of employment.
.The Peruvian Fishermen's Federation went on to explain that, since  September , national leaders and ordinary fishermen and their wives had been persecuted by the Government, arrested and detained. They stated that over  persons were being held in the State security prisons.
.The complainant organisation also stated that when the Ministry of Fisheries declared open the fishing season, all the fishermen refused to go to sea until the Government had agreed to discuss with them and release the detainees. According to the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation, the Government then ordered the dismissal of all anchovy fishermen belonging to Pesca Per, with an obligation to re-register before  October . This registration, added the complainants, obliged the fishermen to give up their rights and advantages.
.In its reply, the Government explained that the public fish meal and oil production enterprise Pesca Per held a monopoly for the industrial transformation of anchovies into meal and oil, an activity vital for the country's development. From , the situation in that undertaking was critical. A commission composed of representatives of all the sectors concerned had studied the situation and concluded that the enterprise would have to be restructured and reorganised. In application of Legislative Decree No. , adopted for the purpose, the State continued to transform and to market anchovies, but the fishing itself was left to small private undertakings, composed of the workers who served in the Pesca Per fishing fleet or private enterprises. Pesca Per workers were granted considerable facilities and  per cent of the boats were purchased by them.
.However, continued the Government, a group of persons and certain trade union leaders of the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation, in an effort to slow down the country's economic recovery, brought pressure to bear on the workers with a view to preventing them complying with the provisions of the legislative decree. Moreover, on  October , they persuaded some crews to start an untimely strike accompanied by acts of terrorism against the non-striking fishermen. This took place in Lima, Callas, Huacho, Supe and Chincha. It was shown by the police investigations carried out that the workers belonging to the ""Commando Miguel Grau Rebelde y Combatiente"" were opposed to the official date for the opening of the fishing season. The Government provided, in this connection, a list of the persons affected by these terrorist acts.
.Following the investigations, an order was issued for the arrest of the suspected persons. The persons involved were Luis Arce Boya, Marcos Bejarano, Abelardo Ojeda and two other persons, The Government explained that these measures were not directed against the trade union representatives on account of their union activities, but solely for punishable acts. Only five persons had been arrested and once the investigations were complete, they were released. No person was at present being held in connection with this case. The Government also stated that it had not violated the rights and social advantages of the workers.
.The Committee notes that the case before it concerns the arrest of trade union leaders following a strike in the fishing sector. The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, these measures were not taken on account of the trade union activities of the persons concerned, but because of punishable acts. The persons have since been released. Whilst noting these releases, the Committee considers it appropriate to remind the Government that the arrest by the authorities of trade unionists regarding whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may seriously restrict freedom of association. If the Government had sufficient grounds for believing that the persons",0,1976,Peru
242,"concerned had been involved in criminal acts, these persons should have been rapidly brought before the courts to be tried with all the safeguards of a normal judicial procedure.
.The Committee also noted the appearance in the official Journal of an order No. -- n  of  November , by which the Ministry of Labour has withdrawn representative status from the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation leaders vis--vis the State administrations and public and non-public bodies. The reasons for this decision include, in particular, the statement that the strike launched by these leaders conflicted with the state of emergency and that terrorist acts had been committed against persons and private property.
.The Committee considers that such measures adopted by the administrative authorities create problems with regard to Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Peru, according to which workers' organisations have the right to elect their representatives in full freedom and the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee would like the Government to transmit any comments it might wish to make concerning this Order.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest the release of the arrested trade union leaders, but to call the attention of the Government to the principles set out in paragraph  above;(b) to call the attention of the Government to the terms of Article  of Convention No.  concerning the right of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom;(c) to invite the Government to submit its comments concerning the withdrawal of representative status from the Peruvian Fishermen's Federation leaders by virtue of Ministry of Labour Order No. --n  of  November ;(d) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1976,Peru
243,".The Committee already examined this case at its sessions in November  and February , on each of which occasions it presented an interim report.
.The Committee recalls that the allegations mentioned in the complaint and in the representation submitted by various Peruvian trade union organisations under article  of the ILO Constitution relate to the arrest or disappearance of serving or former trade unionists, the taking over of trade union organisations and restrictions on trade union activities.
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the arrest or disappearance of serving or former trade unionists:(i) to note that certain other persons have been released since its last session;(ii) to note, however, that many of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are still in detention without having been brought before courts and to recall the principle that the rapid appearance of a detained trade unionist before the appropriate court is a fundamental right of the individual which is essential in order to safeguard fully the exercise of trade union rights; and to request the Government to provide information on the outcome of the judicial proceedings in respect of those persons who are to be tried by the federal courts;(iii) as regards those persons who, the Government states, are neither being sought nor in prison, to request the Government to extend its co-operation by continuing to seek information as to the situation of those persons, and to request the complainant organisations to provide any further information available to them concerning these same persons;(b) regarding the taking over of trade union organisations and restrictions on trade union activities:(i) to strongly reiterate the urgency of lifting all measures of control by the authorities over trade union organisations and to urge the Government to give priority to the lifting of such measures;(ii) to draw attention to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above concerning restrictions on trade union activities and to express the hope that the restrictions now in force will soon be removed; and, in particular, as regards collective bargaining, to request that one of the objectives of the Government should be to permit its restoration as soon as possible;(iii) with regard to the proposed new law on trade unions to request the Government to supply full information regarding the progress made towards the adoption of this legislation and to express once again the hope that the adoption and application of this law in the near future will ensure the restoration of full, normal, trade union activities;(iv) to request the Government to supply all available information on the evolution of the trade union situation;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.The Committee already examined this case at its session in November , when it submitted an interim report.
.The allegations mentioned in the complaints and in representation submitted by various Peruvian trade union organisations under article  of the ILO Constitution relate to the arrest or disappearance of serving or former trade unionists, the taking over of trade union organisations and restrictions on trade union activities.
.The Committee notes the information provided by the Government but must note with regret, first of all, that despite the time which has elapsed trade union organisations are still under the control of the authorities. In this connection, the Committee wishes to point out that the placing of trade union organisations under control constitutes a serious danger of restricting the rights of workers' organisations to elect their representatives in full freedom and to organise their administration and activities. The Committee considers that the Government should give priority to the lifting of this measure.
.Regarding the restrictions placed on trade union activities, the Committee notes the new statements by the Government concerning the temporary nature of these measures and its intention to return gradually to normal conditions. It considers in this connection that maintenance of the restrictions placed on the right to meet and to carry out elections in workers' organisations would constitute a serious infringement of trade union freedoms. The Committee hopes that restrictions of this type will soon cease.
.With particular reference to the suspension of collective bargaining and the right to strike, the Committee notes that these measures are temporary and have been necessitated by the economic situation in the country. Whilst fully aware of the seriousness of the economic situation in Argentina, the Committee considers that these restrictions should not be maintained longer than is reasonable. It considers in particular that one of the objectives of the Government should be to permit the restoration of collective bargaining as soon as possible.
.The Committee also notes that a new law on workers' associations is being prepared. It hopes that the adoption of this law will soon make it possible to restore full, normal trade union activities.
.In these circumstances and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the arrest or disappearance of serving and former trade unionists:(i) to note with interest that several trade unionists have been released;(ii) to express its concern with the fact that the Government states that it possesses no information on many of the persons mentioned by the complainants, to request the Government to intensify its investigations regarding these persons and to inform it of the results;(iii) to invite the complainant organisations to submit all additional information which they may possess regarding these persons;(iv) to note that some persons are at the disposal of the executive authorities without having been brought before the courts and recall that the rapid appearance of a detained trade unionist before the appropriate court is a civil liberty which is essential in order to safeguard fully the exercise of trade union rights;(v) to request the Government to supply information on the persons concerning whom it has not yet submitted observations;(b) regarding the taking over of trade union organisations and restrictions on trade union activities:(i) to note with regret that, despite the time which has elapsed, trade union organisations are still under the control of the authorities and point out to the Government that it should give priority to the lifting of this measure;(ii) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above concerning the restrictions on trade union activities with regard to meetings, elections, collective bargaining and strikes;(iii) to note that a new law on trade unions is being prepared and to express the hope that the adoption of this law will shortly make it possible to restore fully normal trade union activities throughout the country;(iv) to request the Government to supply all possible information on the evolution of the trade union situation;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaint of the World Federation of Trade Unions was contained in a communication dated  March . The WFTU, in further communications, dated  April and  June , submitted additional information and allegations in connection with the complaint. The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour was contained in a communication dated  June . In further communications, dated  June and  October June , the WCL submitted additional information and allegations in connection with the complaint.
.In a communication dated  May  the National Confederation of Workers of Peru and a number of other trade union organisations in Peru submitted, in accordance with article  of the Constitution of the International Labour Organisation, a representation that Argentina was failing to secure the effective observance of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), ratified by Argentina. The Committee examined this complaint in accordance with a decision taken previously by the Governing Body in a similar situation where a representation made under article  related to matters concerning freedom of association.
.The above-mentioned complaints, additional information and allegations, and the representation referred to in the preceding paragraph were duly transmitted to the Government for observations in accordance with the usual procedure applicable in connection with complaints of alleged infringements of trade union rights.
.The Government, in a communication dated  May , transmitted certain observations in reply to some of the allegations made against it. Further observations and information were transmitted by the Government in three communications dated  and  October and  November .
.Argentina has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In all these circumstances and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the taking over by the Government of the General Confederation of Labour and a number of other trade union organisations, and the general restrictions imposed on the activities of workers' and employers' organisations,(i) to take note of the Government's explanations and",0,1976,Argentina

.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Eight to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations still outstanding refer to the arrest of Domingo Melchor and Santiago Roln Centurin, brothers of the assassinated trade unionist Martino Roln Centurin, the proceedings instituted against Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan, and the alleged torture of a number of trade unionists in custody.
.The Government informed the Committee that a warrant for Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan's arrest was issued on  December  for contravening Act No. / respecting the preservation of the public peace and personal freedom. The Government also stated that Mr. Ojeda Falkan was interrogated on  March . The Government has sent no information on the brothers of Martino Roln Centurin or on the allegations concerning the torture and ill-treatment suffered by trade unionists in custody.
.In its last examination of the case, the Committee observed that there was considerable delay before the decision to issue a warrant for the arrest of Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan and his interrogation: by a magistrate. The Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, expressed the hope that Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan would soon be judged and that the Government would communicate, as soon it was pronounced, the text of the judgement handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. Also on the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body requested the Government to provide information concerning the situation of the brothers of Martino Roln Centurin and its observations in reply to the allegations concerning the ill-treatment of a number of persons in custody.
.At its meetings in February, May and November , the Committee had to postpone its examination of this case, as it had not received the information requested of the Government. At its meeting in February  the Committee again postponed its examination of the case for the same reason. Accordingly, the Governing Body notified the Government that in conformity with the procedure of the Committee, the latter might present a report on the substance of the matter at its next session, even if the observations of the Government were not received by that date. The Committee has not yet received this information.
.In these circumstances, and before examining the substance of the case, the Committee considers it necessary to recall the considerations set forth in its First Report, which it has repeated on various occasions, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and that the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.The Committee expresses its deep concern that the Government has not sent the observations which have been requested of it on repeated occasions and that, given the time which has elapsed, it is compelled to examine the case without having received them.
.As regards the allegations relating to Domingo Melchor and Santiago Roln Centurin and Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan, the Committee recalls that it has emphasised that the detention of trade union officials, even for reasons of internal security, may constitute a grave interference with trade union rights unless accompanied by the appropriate judicial safeguards. In many cases where allegations that trade union leaders or workers have been arrested or sentenced on account of trade union activities have been refuted by governments or met with statements that the arrest or detention was made for subversive activities, for reasons of internal security or for common law crimes, the Committee has always followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit further information as precise as possible concerning the alleged measures, and in particular concerning the judicial proceedings taken, and to supply the texts of sentences pronounced, together with the reasons adduced therefore, to enable it to examine the allegations with full knowledge of the facts.
.As regards the allegations of ill-treatment of workers in custody, the Committee recalls the importance it has always attached to the right of trade unionists, as of all other persons, to enjoy the guarantees afforded by due process of law in accordance with the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its deep concern that, despite the requests made, the Government has not sent the information requested and that the Committee has been obliged to examine the case without having received these observations;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above, and in particular to the principle that the detention of trade union officials may constitute a grave interference with trade union rights unless attended by the appropriate judicial safeguards;(c) to urge the Government to keep the Committee informed of the situation of the Roln Centurin brothers and the proceedings against Jos Gil Ojeda Falkan, and to communicate the text of the judgement given, with the reasons adduced therefore;(d) to urge the Government to send the Committee its observations on the allegations of ill-treatment of trade unionists in custody.
.The Committee already examined this case in November  when it submitted interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report at its th Session (November ).
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants stated that the Christian-inspired trade union movement was being systematically persecuted in Paraguay. They also claimed that torture was being shamelessly practised and expressed the view that a skirmish in April  between the armed forces and a group of guerilleros had been used as a pretext for attacking any organisation working to bring about social reform and an improvement in the miserable lot of the peasants.
.The allegations outstanding refer, first of all, to the peasants' trade union leaders Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez who, the complainants alleged, had been arrested and tortured at the beginning of may . They added that another active peasants' trade unionist, Severo Delgado, had, about the same time, been sought by the police who had raided his house; he had managed to escape to Brazil together with other persons. The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) also mentioned the disappearance, on  April , of the peasants' trade union leader, Martin Roln Centurin. The complainants had reason to believe that he was alive and in custody at a National Guard barracks and had been subjected to torture; he had never been charged with any offence nor brought to trial nor convicted. The World Confederation of Labour (WCL) specified that the person in question had been wounded on the day of his arrest while trying to defend his home. He was in solitary confinement and in a piteous state. The three brothers of Martin Roln Centurin were also in custody: Domingo at the Investigation Department (where there were said to be torture chambers), and Melchor and Santiago, against whom legal proceedings were pending, at Emboscada Penitentiary.
.The Government stated that there had at no time been any infringement of freedom of association; no genuine trade union leader, past or present, had ever been hindered in the performance of his functions. As for the others, the Government stated that it had no knowledge of their whereabouts and refuted the allegations made, claiming that those who were active and knowledgeable in the labour field and who acted within the framework of the Constitution and the national law, had never mentioned having difficulties of any kind whatsoever inside or outside their unions. As to Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jos Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez, they were still in Emboscada Prison, awaiting trial by the ordinary courts on charges of contravening Act No.  respecting the preservation of the public peace and personal freedom. These facts showed clearly, continued the Government, that these persons did not belong to any trade union or suchlike organisation operating lawfully in Paraguay.
.The Committee considered that it needed further information on these various points and, on its recommendation, the Governing Body requested the Government, in particular:- to supply detailed information as to the specific acts Jos Gill Ojeda Falkan, Jose Parra Gaona and Pedro Fretez were said to have committed and to communicate, as soon as they were pronounced, the texts of the judgements handed down in respect of these persons and the reasons adduced therefor;- to supply also information as to the situation of Severo Delgado and Martin Roln Centurin, and the latter's brothers, and the specific acts of which they were accused, to state",0,1976,Paraguay
245,".Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly,",-1,1976,El Salvador
246,".The complaint from the National Union of Singer Sewing Machine Company Workers was submitted by a letter of  May . The Government submitted its observations in a communication received on  February .
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants stated that workers of the Singer Sewing Machine multinational undertaking had been persecuted simply because they were members of a trade union organisation which the management did not like. The latter was said to have violated human rights, Conventions Nos.  and  and various Constitutional clauses and national laws. The complainants mentioned as evidence the closing of most of the undertaking's production and sales sectors, the dismissal, as a means of coercion, of over  workers and the systematic violation of the collective agreement between the undertaking and the complainant union. The undertaking was said to have reduced pay and to have violated other rights established by collective agreement.
.In its reply, the Government stated that two administrative investigations were at present under way within the appropriate inspection section of the Ministry of Labour following complaints against the Singer Sewing Machine Company from the union of that company's workers. The first complaint, relating to violation of freedom of association, was deposited on  April  and resulted in the imposition of a fine of , pesos by Resolution No.  of  November ; an appeal had been lodged against this decision. The second related to alleged violation of the collective agreement. The events had occurred in the town of Medelln and, in view of the results of the investigations carried out, the labour inspectorate had imposed a fine of , pesos by Resolution No.  of  September . An appeal had also been lodged against this decision.
.The Committee has already pointed out, particularly in another case concerning Colombia that, as long as protection against anti-trade union discrimination is effectively provided, the methods adopted to protect workers against such practices may vary from one State to another, but that, if discriminatory practices occur in a country, the Government concerned should, whatever methods may normally be used, take all necessary measures to remedy the situation.
.The Committee had also noted, in the aforementioned case, that the right of association is guaranteed and protected in Colombia by articles  and  of the Labour Code; in addition to providing for penal sanctions, these articles stipulate that the labour administration shall impose fines on guilty parties. Decree No.  of  December  is complementary to these provisions in that it lists the actions on the part of the employer which are considered as breaches of the right of association. This list consists essentially of the practices referred to in Article  of Convention No. . In addition, articles  to  of the Labour Code grant special immunity (fuero sindical) to certain trade union leaders and to the founders of a union as well as to workers who are members of it before the granting of legal status.
.In the present case, the information transmitted by the Government shows that two fines of , pesos were imposed on the Singer Sewing Machine Company, the first for infringement of freedom of association and the second for violation of a collective agreement. However, appeals have been lodged against both the decisions.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to note the information provided by the Government and to request it to communicate the decisions taken on the appeals against the two resolutions, each imposing fines of , pesos on the Singer Company.",0,1976,Colombia
247,"trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating",-1,1976,El Salvador
248,"the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.
.Cases Nos.  and  were examined by the Committee in May and November , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Case No.  was examined by the Committee in November  and May , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since it last examined these cases the Committee has received communications from the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur porkers ( October ), the Latin American Central of Workers ( April  and  August ) and the World Confederation of Labour ( September ). The Government sent two communications dated  and  December .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining - Convention,  (No. ).
.Case No.  concerns various allegations, one of which refers to incidents which occurred on  October  during a strike at the El Len factory, when workers were attacked by the police and two of them lost their lives. Other allegations relate to the arrest and torture of  workers of the undertaking Quality food de Centro Amrica and the arrest of  workers and disappearance of two trade union officials during an attack on the offices of two trade unions. According to the complainants all these situations fitted into the general pattern since the passage of an ""anti-terrorist Act"" designed to legalise the repression of the workers.
.Case No.  referred to the imprisonment of a peasant militant, Francisco Girn Ramos, who had been charged with slandering the authorities of Rosario de Mora. According to the complainants the real reason for this arrest lay in the trade union activities of Mr. Girn.
.In Case No.  the complainants alleged that the Government had launched a bloodthirsty campaign of persecution against agricultural workers and their organisations, resulting in many deaths, injuries and arrests.
.In connection with the above allegations the Government stated that various self-styled trade union groups were operating unlawfully, propagating anarchist and anti-democratic doctrines prohibited by the Political Constitution, and committing criminal acts. It was members of these groups, continues the Government, who killed Mr. Trnsito Vsquez. The Government professed its respect for freedom, but said that breaches of the law had occurred and that they would be punished by the competent authorities. In connection with the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, the Government said that his release had been ordered and that proceedings had been instituted against him for the destruction of original documents; the text of the judgement would be communicated once it had been handed down.
.At its May-June  Session, in connection with Case No. , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to communicate the text of the judgement rendered in the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.At its November  Session, in connection with cases Nos.  and , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to send its observations on the situation of various trade unionists named in an annex, and on the other aspects of the case referred to in paragraphs  to  and  of the Committee's th Report, and to communicate the judgement to be pronounced in the case concerning the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, with the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee has so far not received the information requested.
.In a letter of  October  the Trades Onion International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers alleges that Jos Guillermo Rivas Gonzlez, General Secretary of the Union of workers in the Cotton, Kenaf, Synthetic Fibre and Allied Textile Industries of El Salvador, was murdered on  September , and that Miguel Angel Solis and Orlando Platero, officials of the Union of Textile Industry Workers, were murdered on  September ; the reason for these alleged murders is said to be the trade union activity of the victims it is also alleged that other trade union officials have been imprisoned.
.By a telegram of  April  the Latin American Central of porkers alleges that the workers of the unions of the national undertakings La Peca, La Constancia, Embotelladora Tropical and STECEL were harshly repressed by the Government because they had demanded collective labour contracts; as a result, seven leaders and militants of these unions have been killed and a number injured.
.By letter of  August  the Latin American Central of workers sends a list of  primary-school teachers allegedly murdered with ""the undisguised complicity of the educational authorities of the country"". In addition to mentioning the full names of the teachers, the list indicates their trade union activities or their relationship with the trade union organisations, their place of work, and the date, place and circumstances of their deaths. In the same letter CLAT repeats the need for the urgent dispatch of a special mission to investigate the situation complained of.
.By a communication of  September  the world Confederation of Labour alleges that some  workers of the IMES undertaking (Industrial Manufactureras, S.A.) in the Republic of El Salvador have been deprived of their work for over three months, and that the undertaking has failed to fulfil its legal and contractual obligations; WCL requests that this document should be attached to the complaints against the Government of El Salvador for systematic violation of labour and trade union rights and ""that the authorities should be asked to take the necessary measures to secure respect for the rights of the workers in order to defend them against the manoeuvres of the foreign firm"".
.By letters of  and  December  the Government has replied to the international Labour office in connection with",0,1976,El Salvador
249,"in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the",0,1976,El Salvador
250,"the complaints. According to it, the Government of the Revolutionary Junta of El Salvador, since its installation on  October , has adopted a policy entirely different from that of earlier regimes, a policy of absolute respect for human rights, including freedom of association; it accepts no responsibility for any violations which may have occurred in the past.
.The Committee notes the statement made in December  by the new Government that it will follow a policy of respect for human rights, including the aspects relating to freedom of association. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that a general statement of this nature does not provide the elements of information necessary for the elucidation of the present cases, since they are part of a well-defined series of circumstances and situations the examination of which requires it to be in possession of the information which the Governing Body has requested of the Government on repeated occasions.
.The Committee recalls that on earlier occasions, when examining allegations relating to the violation of trade union rights by a government, it has emphasised that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. In this sense, the Committee has taken the view that, where a change of regime has taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor might have had since its accession to power.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statement made in December  of the new Government that it has adopted a policy of respect for human rights, including aspects relating to freedom of association;(b) to request the Government to send:(i) information in connection with paragraphs  and  of the present report, respecting the proceedings against Mr. Francisco Girn Ramos, the present situation of the various trade unionists listed in the annex to this case, the accusations of torture and persecution of trade unionists and trade union organisations, the stage reached in the proceedings in connection with the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, and the incidents which occurred during a strike of workers of the El Len factory;(ii) its observations on the new allegations referred to in paragraphs , ,  and  of the present report, relating to the murder of the workers, trade union officials and primary-school teachers mentioned in the annex to this case, to the repression of workers and trade unions which demanded collective labour agreements, and to the situation of  workers of the IMES undertaking;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee last examined these cases in May , when it submitted interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (- June ).
.The complaints were presented by  trade union organisations of El Salvador and by the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES) and the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), and, with respect to Case No. , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the World Confederation of Agricultural Workers (WCAW). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) also presented a complaint relating to the latter case by a communication of  July .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding in Case No.  referred firstly to incidents which had occurred during a strike at the El Lon factory. According to the complaint (dated  October ) the workers who had been preparing to organise a collection in support of the strike had been attacked by the police and two of them had lost their lives.
.The complainants further alleged that the following trade union leaders had been tortured during their imprisonment in July : Romeo Soto Crespo, Gilberto Ruiz Ponce, Miguel Rivera Valle, Rufino Gonzlez Avelar, Teresa Francisca Maldonado (who subsequently disappeared) and Ricardo Erazo (arrested in January ). They also mentioned the disappearance, in January , of Rafael Antonio Martinez, a member of the executive of the Leather Workers' Union.
.Other complaints referred to arrests. It was alleged that the firm ""Lcteas Foremost"" had helped to bring about the arrest of the following persons: Jos Napolen Mina, Carlos Humberto Gonzlez, officials of the employees' union of the company, arrested on  March ; Jos Mauricio Gmez, an official of the same union, arrested on  April; Jos Ricardo Martinez Flores, an official of the National Trade Union Federation of the Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS), arrested on  March; and Carlos Ernesto Marin Ayala, arrested on  May. Furthermore, Hctor Antonio Acevedo, an official of the union of the ""Cosmos"" undertaking, had been arrested at Santa Ana on  October . According to the complainants the Government had promulgated an ""anti-territorist Act"" designed to legalise the repression of the workers. Thus, on  December ,  workers of the undertaking ""Quality Food de Centro Amrica"" had been arrested and had been released the next day after being tortured. On  December the arrest had taken place of Rodolfo Hernndez Rosales and Miguel Guzmn, officials of the workers' union of the ""Alianza"" undertaking, and Daniel Garca Guevara, an official of the workers' union of the ""Famosa"" undertaking.
.On  November , the complainants alleged, the national guard had raided the premises of the Puerto El Triunfo Fish Industries Employees' Union and had arrested the following militants and officials: Alejandro Molina Lara, Julio C. Salazar, Oscar L. Chaves, Delia Cristina Hernndez and Juan Francisco Alvarenga.
.As regards Case No.  the complainants stated that the Government had launched a campaign of bloody persecution against agricultural workers and their organisations, in particular against the Salvadorian Agricultural Workers' Federation, resulting in more than  killed and many wounded, in the towns of El Rodeo, La Esperanza, Tecoluco and San Pedro Perulupa. According to the complainant many agricultural workers' leaders had been arrested. On  March , continued the complainant, Trnsito Vsquez, a local leader of FECCAS in the town of La Esperanza, had been murdered by members of the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), a paramilitary government organisation. His body had been found the next day, covered with wounds, and there were indications that he had been tortured. According to the complainants all the available information led to the assumption that the large-scale demonstrations by agricultural workers in the towns of Tecoluco, La Esperanza, Tenancingo, El Rodeo and San Pedro Perulupa, which were held in the following days, should be considered as a reaction of indignation at the murder and at the fact that a number of helicopters of the armed forces had fired on the crowd during the funeral of Trnsito Vsquez.
.The Government had not at that time sent its observations on the various allegations.
.In Case No.  certain complainants had pressed for the appointment of a commission or the dispatch of a representative of the Director-General for an on-the-spot study of the allegations made in the complaint. In Case No. , WCL requested that a commission should immediately be sent to examine the allegations, since it was of the opinion that neither fundamental human rights nor trade union rights were respected in El Salvador, where there were persecutions of trade unions in general and agricultural workers' unions in particular. As early as February  the Committee had noted the gravity of the allegations made by the complainants (in Case No. ). Following its recommendation the Governing Body had at that time expressed its deep concern at the acts committed against trade unions or their leaders which remained unexplained and their harmful implications for the functioning of trade union organisations and the development of industrial relations in the country. The subsequent complaint (Case No. ) also contained extremely serious allegations in respect of many workers and trade unionists who were said to have been killed, injured or arrested.
.In these circumstances the Committee considered in May  that resort should be had to the direct contacts procedure, under which a representative of the Director-General would be sent to the country for discussions with the public authorities and contacts with the workers' and employers' organisations, in order to determine the facts and study possible solutions. The representative of the Director-General would then submit his report to the Committee, which would be able to examine the allegations and formulate its own conclusions with better knowledge",1,1976,El Salvador

Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1976,Nicaragua
252,".The Committee has already examined Case No.  at its November  session, when it submitted an interim report. Since then the Government has sent a further communication dated  February . The complaints relating to Case No.  have come from the Trade Union of Carpenters, Bricklayers, Timber and Allied workers of Managua, the World Federation of Trade Unions and the General Labour Confederation of Managua (Independent). They are contained, respectively, in communications dated  September ,  February  and  January . The WFTU supplied further information on  January . The Government forwarded its observations by communications dated  December  and  March .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union leaders(i) to note the release of the persons named by the complainants;(ii) to draw attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above concerning, firstly, the detention of trade union officials, and, secondly, the independence of the trade union movement, and, in particular,(iii) to point out to the Government that the detention by the authorities of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found involves restrictions of trade union rights;(b) with regard to the allegations relating to interference by the authorities in the drawing up of trade union rules and the granting of legal personality to draw attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above, and in particular(i) to the fact that an appeal should lie to the courts against any administrative decision for refusal to register the rules of a trade union or to grant a trade union legal personality, and that,(ii) whilst it is true that the founders of a trade union must comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to hamper freedom to form organisations.
.In a joint communication of  May , the world Confederation of Labour and the Latin American Central of Workers presented a complaint concerning the violation of trade union rights in Nicaragua.
.The text of the above communication was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a letter of  July .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint relates to the Union of Agricultural Workers of Nueva Segovia (UTC) which, according to the complainant organisations, is affiliated to the Central of Workers of Nicaragua (CTN) and comprises over  communities and organisations of rural workers in the region.
.In their communication, the complainants alleged that members of the national army had prevented the holding of a meeting of the Council of first-degree organisations of the UTC which had been convened for  and  December  near Jalapa, in the department of Nueva Segovia.
.The complainants stated that, in the early hours of  December , the home of a member of the UTC, where Adolfo Bonilla, General Secretary of the Central of Workers of Nicaragua, was staying, was broken into and that Bonilla, who was due to take part in the meeting scheduled for the same day, was arbitrarily and illegally arrested along with two other persons.
.The complainants added that, while the General Secretary of the CTN was being taken to a place of detention in the locality, other members of the armed forces arrested UTC leaders, among whom were Cstulo Lpez, chairman; Venancio Blandn, comptroller; Francisco Cceres, secretary for training; Mximo Zeledn, secretary for co-operatives; Vicente Garcia, member; and two members of the CTN Executive, Carlos Huembes and Ofilio Garcia. All of them were locked up in two detention centres (Jalapa and Ocotal) and subjected to physical and psychological torture for two days, during which the leaders of the UTC and CTN were ordered to cease their trade union activities in the region on pain of death.
.Following action taken by the Legal Department of the CTN, the detained leaders were released on  December, after their heads had been shaved and the national leaders had been threatened with the consequences if they ever returned to the region. Despite their rapid release, Mximo Zeledn, Vicente Garcia and Matas Talavera had to undergo medical and hospital treatment as a result of their maltreatment by the police. Consequently, the meeting of the Council of the UTC could not be held, which, stated the complainants, was in line with the Government's objectives.
.In conclusion, the CLAT and the WCL requested that a number of measures should be taken, including the sending of a fact-finding Committee, and that the right of workers to organise freely should be respected.
.In its reply, the Government stated that the allegations submitted by the complainant organisation were false, premeditated and more of a political than a trade union nature. The Government added that no organisation by the name of Central of Workers of Nicaragua or Union of Agricultural Workers of Nueva Segovia was registered either at the Department of Trade Union Organisations or at the Department of Co-operatives of the Ministry of Labour. The situation was the same as regards the communities and organisations of rural workers said to be affiliated to the UTC.
.By way of evidence, the Government attached to its communication various documents, including the list of federations and Confederations registered with the Department of Trade Union Organisations of the Ministry of Labour, and the list of organisations and associations of the Department of Nueva Segovia. With reference to the allegations concerning the Secretary for Cooperatives of the UTC, the Government stated that no co-operative or any other grouping of this name or of that of the CTN was listed on the Ministry's files.
.The Government also attached a cutting from the newspaper La Prensa, of  December , containing the minimum programme of the Democratic Union for Liberation (UDEL), a political opposition movement in which the Central of Workers of Nicaragua participates. Among the signatories of this programme, in their capacity as representatives of the CTN, are Adolfo Bonilla and Carlos Huembes, both of whom are mentioned in the complaint.
.In conclusion, the Government stated that it had never ceased to apply the ILO Conventions which it has ratified, in particular Convention No. .
.Generally speaking, the Committee has always considered that freedom of assembly for trade union purposes constitutes one of the fundamental elements of trade union rights' and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee considers that the detention of trade union leaders with the aim of preventing the holding of a union meeting constitutes a serious violation of the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee likewise considers that, during their detention, trade unionists, like anyone else, should benefit from the guarantees provided for under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Committee has also expressed the view that the detention by authorities of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that the Government merely indicates that the two organisations to which the arrested leaders belonged are not registered with the Ministry of Labour and that the Central of Workers of Nicaragua participates in a political opposition movement. The Government adds, however, that two of the leaders concerned have signed the programme of this political movement in the name of the CTN. The Committee considers it relevant to recall that if, in certain instances, it has concluded that a complaint does not call for further examination, this was only after it had received information from the Government showing sufficiently precisely and with sufficient detail that the measure of detention was in no way occasioned by trade union activities, but solely by activities outside the trade union sphere which were either prejudicial to public order or of a political nature. In the present case, the Government gives no details of the reasons justifying the arrest of the trade unionists or of the allegations of maltreatment inflicted on the detainees.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above;(b) to request the Government to supply information on the reasons justifying the arrest of the persons concerned;(c) to request the Government to forward its observations on the allegations concerning the maltreatment alleged to have been inflicted on the detainees;(d) to transmit the substance of the Government's reply to the complainant organisations to enable them to forward their observations and, in particular, to furnish details regarding the situation of the Central of Workers of Nicaragua and the Union of Agricultural Workers which, according to the",0,1976,Nicaragua
253,"of the facts.
.On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body requested the Government to give its consent to a representative of the Director-General visiting El Salvador at an early date to examine the allegations made within the context of the direct contacts procedure.
.In a Letter of  June  the Government states that self-styled peasant groups, calling themselves the ""Federation of Catholic Peasants of EL Salvador"" (FECCAS) and the ""Union of Field Labourers"" (UTC) have taken advantage of the freedom of expression enjoyed by the population to cake public statements on various occasions - for instance on  May  in the newspaper La Crnica - that they form the basis of a clandestine organisation, the ""People's Revolutionary Bloc"" (BPR), to appeal to all workers to give their ""organised and militant support to the people's cause"" within the Revolutionary Council of Trade Unions (CSR) and to eliminate ""tendencies opposing their class interests which can only mislead the proletariat and confuse their minds ..."". These various groups, adds the Government, operate unlawfully, not only because they have not been granted legal personality by the State but also because they are propagating anarchist and anti-democratic doctrines prohibited by section  of the Constitution.
.In their issues of ,  and  March , continues the Government, national newspapers with wide readership ( a Prensa Grfica, Diario de Hoy, Diario Latino and Diario el Mundo) reported that religious organisations of peasants such as the Bloc, Led by recognised agents of international communism, have progressed from political propaganda to purely criminal acts such as sacking, destroying and burning the humble homes of peasants who are unwilling to abide by their watchwords of hatred, violence and death; the Government is saddened by the pictures of many groups of families who have fled these attacks. Other citizens have been faced with the choice between joining the Bloc or suffering the consequences of its ""militancy"". The victims of such acts include  dead and many wounded; the newspapers have reported a number of atrocities committed by members of FECCAS, UTC and BPR, particularly on Trnsito Vsquez after they had killed him. Members of these groups injure people, tie them up and stone them, and travel around in gangs shouting threats over loud-speakers.
.Following instructions received from abroad, continues the Government, the enemies of El Salvador have set a characteristic pattern for internal strife by highly unconventional means ranging from sedition and subversion to smear campaigns abroad which disguise reality and present a false image of the country to friendly nations. The Government adds that it is not its intention to make a secret of social and economic problems, but that patriotic citizens are convinced that these problems must be solved with the participation of all sectors in the country, in a peaceful and orderly manner and with scrupulous respect for the Law. They oppose the class struggle which is being fomented in some quarters and the violence advocated by others. They are partisans of a humanist and democratic approach affording each individual the opportunity for self-development. The Government believes that the status of an individual is determined by his efforts, his capacities and his conduct and not by noble birth or inherited wealth. It seeks the welfare of all without prejudice to the rights of others, in the conviction that social equilibrium is to be found in mutual understanding of the rights and duties of each citizen. Peace cannot exist without justice, says the Government, but justice cannot exist without the maintenance of the peaceful climate which is a prerequisite for constructive work and without means of defence against subversive conspiracy; security is essential for the promotion of economic development, which brings social progress and justice in its train.
.The Government adds that the acts committed by elements of FECCAS, UTC and BPR are designated as offences within the competence of the penal court by the Act respecting the defence and maintenance of public order. The penal court has examined four files, from which it transpires that:(a) the persons who were prosecuted acted in their capacity as members of FECCAS and UTC, both of which are members of the BPR, and were either the authors of the crimes or accessories thereto;(b) the accused have appointed counsel for the defence, and steps have been taken to enable the counsel to intervene on their behalf;(c) the accused, Mximo Garcia Lpez, Jose Felipe Matas Vsquez and Sarbelio Garcia Ramirez, cite the names of Tranquilino Prez, Faustino Vsquez and Marcelino Prez, all members of the above-mentioned subversive organisations, as being responsible for the death of Trnsito Vsquez, having put him to death because he refused to take part in the crimes committed against the peasants of the townships of EL Rodeo, La Esperanza, Tecoluco and Miraflores in the circumscription of San Pedro Perulupa; these allegations were corroborated by the testimony of other persons who were present when the aforesaid accused made their extra-judicial statements; these witnesses are not members of the security forces and, when they questioned the accused as to whether their statements were spontaneous, they were told that this was the case;(d) the persons involved took part in the attack on the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in November .The documents of the trial are available for consultation by persons who are duly authorised by the Law..The Government rejects allegations that it persecutes trade union organisations of all kinds. On the contrary, it points out that there are  trade unions with legal personality carrying on their activities in full freedom and quotes many other figures relating to trade union sections, federations and Confederations, collective Labour agreements, etc. The Government also indicates that the unions have been able to elect workers' representatives to the management board of the Social Security Institute of EL Salvador, the National Minimum Wage Council and the Social Housing Fund.

.Finally, the Government reaffirms its respect for individual rights, including freedom of association. It encourages the formation of trade unions and collective bargaining; it protects organisations in the exercise of their functions in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. It does not, however, countenance any violation of the Law which may be under investigation by the competent authorities, since the independence of the authorities of the State in their respective legal capacities is respected in the country and their competence cannot be delegated to other bodies.
.In a telegram of  July  the WCL and the WCAW allege that Pedro Lpez, a member of the executive Committee of the Latin American Peasant Federation, has been arrested at Cojutepeque and that his whereabouts are unknown. CLAT refers to the same facts in its communication of  July , adding that the person concerned is General Secretary of the Peasant Federation of El Salvador and a member of the national executive of the Confederation of Workers of El Salvador. He is said to have been arrested and beaten by the security forces on  July .
.The Government has not yet replied to these various allegations.
.WCL and WCAW recently presented further allegations in a letter dated  October . These allegations, which refer to the break-up of a union in an INCA undertaking, have been transmitted to the Government for observations.
.The Committee will examine at its next session, in the light of the reply received from the Government, the question of establishing direct contacts to clarify the issues raised in the present cases.
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government. The latter replies partially to the serious allegations made, giving details only on the legal proceedings taken following the death of Trnsito Vsquez and on the identity of the presumed authors of the homicide. In this connection the Committee notes the contradictions between this information and the content of the complaints. It would like to receive a copy of the judgement to be given in this case and detailed information on all the other aspects of the cases.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the reply of the Government as regards the trade union situation as a whole and as regards the particular case of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez;(b) to request the Government to send its observations by  January  at the latest on the situation of the trade unionists named in the Annex hereto and on the other aspects of the case referred to in paragraphs  to  and , and to communicate the judgement to be pronounced in the case concerning the death of",-1,1976,El Salvador

.The Committee has already examined Case No.  at its sessions in November  and February , when it submitted interim conclusions to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ), and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.The complaints and additional information were presented by  trade union organisations of El Salvador and by the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES) and the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA). The Government of El Salvador, for its part, sent observations on the various allegations made.
.More recently, the world Confederation of Labour presented a complaint by communication of  April , and sent additional information in a communication of  April . This complaint figured as Case No. .
.The Committee has decided to deal in a single report with the questions still outstanding from Case No.  and the new complaint contained in Case No. .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In case No.  FUSS and FESTIAVTSCES pressed for the appointment of a commission or the dispatch of a representative of the Director-General for an on-the-spot study of the allegations made in the complaint. At its February  meeting the Committee decided to postpone the examination of this request.
.In Case No.  WCL requests that a commission should immediately be sent to examine the allegations, since it is of the opinion that neither fundamental human rights nor trade union rights are respected in El Salvador, where there are persecutions of trade unions in general and agricultural workers' unions in particular.
.When the Committee examined the complaints in Case No.  at its February  session, it noted the gravity of the allegations made by the complainants. Following the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body expressed its deep concern at the acts committed against trade unions or their leaders which remained unexplained and their harmful implications for the functioning of trade union organisations and the development of industrial relations in the country.
.The most recent complaint made by WCL in Case No.  also contains extremely serious allegations in respect of many workers and trade unionists who are said to have been killed, injured or arrested.
.In the light of all these circumstances the Committee considers that resort should be had to the direct contacts procedure, under which a representative of the Director-General is sent to the country for discussions with the public authorities and contacts with the workers' and employers' organisations, and to determine the facts and study possible solutions. The representative would then submit his report to the Committee, which would be able to examine the allegations and formulate its own conclusions with better knowledge of the facts.
.In this respect the Committee wishes to stress that the object of the procedure is to guarantee the respect of freedom of association both in law and in fact; it is convinced that this procedure can protect governments against unfounded accusations, provided that they recognise the importance for their own good name of collaborating fully with the Committee to enable it to undertake a thorough examination of the allegations and seek solutions to the problems.
.The Committee has already examined this case in November , and at that session it submitted interim conclusions to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ).
.Since then, the following organisations have sent communications on the dates indicated: Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur workers ( May ); Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers ( June and  August ); United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador and Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador ( July ); Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama ( October,  November and  December ). The Government, for its part, provided information on  March and  December .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body;(a) to express its deep concern at the acts committed against trade unions or their leaders which remain unexplained and their harmful implications for the functioning of trade union; organisations and the development of industrial relations;(b) to note with interest that some of the trade unionists arrested have been released;(c) to express, nevertheless, its regret that the Government has not yet forwarded its observations with respect to the allegations relating to the death of two workers during a strike at the undertaking El Len (paragraph  above), the torture of certain trade unionists (paragraph  above), the disappearance of Rafael Antonio Martinez (paragraph  above) and the arrest of numerous trade union officials employed by the undertakings Lcteas Foremost SA, Cosmos, Puerto El Triunfo Fish Industries, Quality Food de Centro Amrica, Alianza and Famosa (paragraphs , ,  and  above), and to request the Government to transmit its comments on these matters as speedily as possible;(d) to draw the Government's attention to the principles set forth in paragraph  above with respect to protection against acts of anti-union discrimination;(e) to note that the Committee has decided to adjourn its examination of the request made by the complainants for an on-the-spot inquiry into this case;(f) to take note of the present interim report.
.In a communication addressed to the United Nations on  February , a number of Salvadorian trade unions presented a complaint of alleged violations of trade union rights in El Salvador. The complaint was signed by representatives of the following organisations: Union of Workers in the Printing and Allied Industries of El Salvador; Union of the Furniture and Allied Industries; Union of the Central American Cardboard Undertaking; Union of Workers in the Poultry-Rearing, Egg and Allied Industries of El Salvador; Union of the Association of Private Employees; Anion of Workers in the Engineering and Basic Metallurgic Industries; National Union of Tailors; General Union of Dressmakers; Union of workers in the Cotton, Hemp, Synthetic Fibre and other related industries; Union of Workers in the Dry-cleaning Industry; Union of the Steelworkers' Undertaking; General Union of Workers in the Building and Allied Industries; Union of the Textile Industries; Works Union of ANDA; Union of Independent Electricians of El Salvador; Union of Workers in the Soft Drinks, Beer, Ice, Drinking Water and Similar Industries; Works Union of the El Salvador Sugar Refinery; Union of the Cement Industry of El Salvador; Union of Workers of the Agricultural Implements Undertaking; Union of Workers in the Leather, Shoe and Allied Industries; INCALSA Works Union; Union of Workers of the Cosmos Undertaking.
.The text of the communication was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a letter dated  October .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their communication the  complainant organisations expressed their concern at the systematic repression of trade union leaders and militants who, they alleged, were kept under constant watch by the police and subjected to political persecution, arrest, illegal restraint and torture. The complainant organisations described the social situation in El Salvador as precarious and stated that even the most elementary human rights were being violated.
.In support of their statement the complainants referred to a number of specific cases, certain of which related to the death of trade union leaders. They mentioned the case of Rafael Aguiada Carranza, Deputy in the National Legislative General Assembly and General Secretary of the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), killed on  September . The following day, Jesus Miguel Angel Hernndez Rogel, former General Secretary of the Union of the Furniture and Allied Industries (SIMAS), was arrested as he was leaving the premises of the FUSS, and his body was subsequently found at Chinamequita (Department of San Salvador). On  November  Feliciano Snchez Prez, a leader of the Union of the Furniture and Allied Industries (SIMAS), was found murdered at a tourist centre, ""La Puerta del Diablo"".
.Other union leaders were said to have been arrested, and the complainants mentioned the names of Romeo",-1,1976,El Salvador
255,"Soto Crespo, Gilberto Ruiz Ponce, Miguel Rivera Valle, Rufino Gonzalo Avelar, Teresa Francisca Maldonado and Remberto Sosa Hernndez, all leaders of SIMAS. These persons were alleged to have been imprisoned between  June and  July  and to have been tortured. Furthermore, Remberto Sosa Hernndez is said to have disappeared, although he had previously been seen by his fellow prisoners.
.Jos Ernesto Sorto Argueta, General Secretary of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries (FESTIAVTSCES) and workers' representative on the National Minimum wage Council, was arrested on  October . This arrest, stated the complainants, took place as Mr. Sorto Argueta was leaving his workplace, the Granja Montserrat Company. The complainants stated that they had learnt from an unofficial source that Jos Ernesto Sorto Argueta was imprisoned in the security corps barracks of the National Guard of El Salvador.
.On  January , at Sonsonate, the National Guard arrested Ricardo Erazo, Second Disputes Secretary of the National Trade Union Federation of Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS), who was found in the prison at Sonsonate bearing signs of torture, although his arrest had been denied by the police. Mr. Erazo was released on  January .
.Certain of the allegations refer to attacks on trade union premises. On  October  the headquarters of the Federation of Unions of the Building, Transport and Allied Industries was totally destroyed by a fire which had been started deliberately. On  November  the premises of a number of federations suffered material damage as a result of a bomb explosion.
.Finally, the complainants maintained that the Government was not applying the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and  and requested the setting up of a commission to carry out an inquiry on the spot.
.In its reply the Government stated that the activities, statements and publications of the complainant unions showed them to be leftist organisations militating in favour of structural changes with a view to establishing a revolutionary socialist state.
.The Government stated that it had no official knowledge of the persons named in the complaint as having been arrested or killed by members of the police security corps. The Government observed that no evidence had been produced in support of these allegations and therefore categorically denied the facts related by the complainants.
.The Government pointed out that Rafael Aguiada Carranza had lost his life as a result of a crime committed on  September  in a street in San Salvador while he was driving the car of another opposition deputy. The criminal courts were at present conducting investigations but they had not yet discovered either the motives for the crime or its authors. The Government rejected all responsibility for the incidents.
.The disappearance of Jos Ernesto Sorto Argueta, stated the Government, was a well-known fact, since he had not attended the National Minimum Wage council since October . The Government added that the reasons for his absence were unknown and denied all, involvement in the affair.
.The Government recalled that, while it had not ratified Conventions Nos.  and , most of the rights guaranteed by these instruments were protected by the national legislation. The Government stated that there were in the country  unions forming  federations and  Confederation. Furthermore,  collective agreements were in force. According to the Government no discrimination existed against the workers and their organisations, as was evidenced by the fact that a number of the complainants held important posts on official bodies such as the National Minimum Wage Council and the Board of Management of the Social Housing Fund Finally, the Government mentioned its achievements in the social field.
.The Committee notes that the allegations before it refer to the death, arrest or disappearance of union leaders and to the torture to which a number of them are alleged to have been subjected. Other allegations refer to attacks on trade union premises. The Committee also notes that the Government denies the facts reported by the complainants.
.Before dealing individually with the questions raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to express its concern at the gravity of certain of the allegations and in general to recall that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop when basic human rights are respected.
.As regards the allegations relating to the death of trade unionists, the Committee recalls that, in cases involving loss of life, it has invariably stressed the desirability of the Government instituting an immediate and impartial inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and to determine responsibilities.
.In the present case the Government refers merely to the case of Rafael Aguiada Carranza, which is at present under investigation, but supplies no information on the allegations relating to Jests Miguel Angel Hernndez Rogel and Feliciano Snchez Prez.
.As regards the allegations concerning the arrest and disappearance of union leaders, the Committee observes that the statements of the complainants and those of the Government are in many respects contradictory, the latter denying the responsibility of the police for the alleged incidents. In this respect the Committee notes that, according to the complainants, Ricardo Erazo was found in a public prison after his arrest had been denied by the authorities. In general, the Committee wishes to stress that a climate of violence and uncertainty may represent a serious impediment to the exercise of union rights and that such situations call for strict measures on the part of the authorities in order to redress the situation. In the present case the Committee considers that the Government should conduct an investigation into the situation of the persons mentioned in the complaint.
.With reference to the damage caused to trade union premises, the Committee likewise takes the view that, in such cases, an independent inquiry would be useful with a view to determining responsibilities.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body.(a) to express its concern at the gravity of certain of the allegations;(b) to recall that, in general, a genuinely free and independent trade union movement can only develop where human rights are respected;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraph  above, to request it to transmit the results of the inquiry into the death of Rafael Aguiada Carranza when they are known, to indicate whether similar inquiries have been undertaken in the two other cases of death mentioned in the complaint and, if so, to communicate the results;(d) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above, and to stress the desirability of conducting investigations into the situation of the persons mentioned in the complaint and of making an inquiry into the damage caused to the premises of a number of federations;(e) to request the complainants to communicate their observations on the Government's reply, and in particular to supply details concerning the allegations of arrests of trade union leaders, on the understanding that the observations so transmitted will be communicated to the Government for its observations;(f) to take note of the present interim report, it being understood that the Committee will submit a further report when the information requested above has been obtained.",0,1976,El Salvador

.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication the WFTU protested against what it regarded as the arbitrary dismissal of over  workers and a group of trade union leaders elected by the members of the National Union of Workers of the National Agrarian Institute.
.The Government attached to its communication a document prepared by the National Agrarian Institute concerning the allegation.
.In this document it is stated that, in order to meet the targets set by the Government for the implementation of agrarian reform, the National Agrarian Institute made a study for the purpose of reorganising its structure, and adopted Resolution No.  of  March , the preamble to which is quoted in the document. In particular, the preamble indicates that:- in accordance with section , clause , of the Labour Code, employers may make reductions in staff in accordance with the stipulations of the collective agreement, which in the present case establishes an order of priority subject to modification where the exigencies of the service require the employment of workers possessing certain levels of skill, experience and honesty;- in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, notice of any change in the membership of the managing Committee of a trade union shall be given to the Ministry of Labour and Social welfare, and no change shall be effective unless this requirement has been observed. In the present instance this obligation was not met when the managing Committee of the National Union of Workers of the National Agrarian Institute was elected on  April ;- in accordance with section  of the Agrarian Reform Act the Executive Director of the Institute is responsible for the appointment, transfer, promotion, suspension or dismissal of officials and employees of the Institute in accordance with the legal provisions; and- in accordance with sections  and  of the Labour Code, where a contract is made for an unspecified period, either of the parties may terminate it by giving notice to the other party or by paying an equivalent amount.
.In the studies undertaken by the Institute prior to the decision to terminate the contracts of employment, the amount of savings that would be effected was based on a  per cent reduction in the number of staff.
.According to the document furnished by the Institute, the provisions of the collective agreement in force were respected. It was also stated that no union leader had had his contract terminated in accordance with the legal provisions. As the only legally registered management Committee had held office between July  and July  and none of its workers had been dismissed, the National Union of Workers of the National Agrarian Institute had had no legally registered management Committee since July .
.Finally, it is stated in the report that all the workers affected by the reorganisation of the Institute have received the benefits legally due to them, and the situation has so far given rise to no complaints.
.The Committee notes that the case concerns measures of dismissal affecting workers of the National Agrarian Institute and in particular the leaders of the National Union of workers of this body, whose election, according to the Government, was not registered with the Ministry of Labour.
.The Committee has always taken the view that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against all acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment, and that this protection is particularly desirable in the case of trade union officials. However, the principle that a worker or a union leader may not suffer prejudice by reason of his union activities does not necessarily imply that the fact that a person holds a trade union office confers on him immunity against dismissal irrespective of the circumstances.
.In the present case it would appear that the dismissals were part of a reorganisation of the National Agrarian Institute. Furthermore, the relative provisions of the collective agreement appear to have been respected and no complaints have been submitted at the national level.
.Finally, the Committee considers that the complaint is couched in very general terms which do not enable it to reach a conclusion as to whether the dismissals constituted acts of antiunion discrimination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case calls for no further examination on its part.",0,1976,Honduras
257,"liable to cause a lasting deterioration in industrial relations in the country.
.The Committee therefore pointed out, as it had done on previous occasions, that it would be particularly appropriate, in the case of the persons who had lost their lives during the disturbances, that the Government should institute an impartial and independent inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and determine responsibility.
.With regard to the persons who had been arrested, the Committee considered that a summary procedure such as that provided for under Decree No.  might result in unfounded decisions being taken. Any trade unionist who had been arrested should be fully ensured the right of defence guaranteed by normal judicial procedure, as provided for by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
.As regards the union officials and activists who had been dismissed or laid off the Committee emphasised that labour relations could be greatly improved if the employers concerned gave serious consideration to the possibility of reinstating the persons affected.
.As regards the allegations concerning suspension of the legal personality of trade union organisations, the Committee drew attention to the fact that the suspension or dissolution of a trade union by administrative authority is not in conformity with the principles of freedom of association, and that on its recommendation the Governing Body had in a recent case urged the Government to take the necessary steps without delay to amend the provisions of the Labour Code in that respect.
.In general terms, the Committee considered it desirable for the competent authorities to re-examine the situation of the trade unionists who had been sanctioned under the provisions of the aforementioned Decree No.  and the decision to suspend or withdraw the legal personality of various trade unions referred to by the complainants. The authorities should also approach the employers concerned with a view to the reinstatement of the trade union members who had been dismissed.
.In these circumstances the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to supply detailed information on the death, arrest, dismissal or lay-off of trade unionists and the non-recognition, suspension and withdrawal of the legal personality of trade union organisations.
.In its communication of  April , the Government begins by referring to the deaths of trade unionists. In this respect it states that it is not for the Ministry of Labour to conduct an inquiry into the deaths which took place on the occasion of the general strike of  September  or into the causes of these deaths, since these events go beyond the field of labour law and enter that of politics. The question therefore lies within the competence of the judiciary.
.As regards the dismissals which followed the general strike the Government states that the Ministry of Labour has always exercised - and will continue to exercise - particular caution in authorising collective dismissals of workers. This caution was heightened by the general strike, and the strictness with which the administrative inquiries were conducted resulted in the authorisation of only a limited number of dismissals.
.Likewise, the policy of the Ministry of Labour is to refrain from cancelling the registration of legally recognised workers' organisations. In this connection the Government observes that the Ministry of Labour is not empowered ""to withdraw legal personality"", a prerogative which belongs to the ordinary labour courts. Where a request is made for the deregistration of a union, the Ministry makes exhaustive inquiries to ascertain the veracity and the factual and legal foundation of the allegations to ensure that the occupational association concerned is not deregistered on insufficient grounds. Nor does the Ministry of Labour decide to suspend the legal personality of a union which is taking specific action, except in special and exceptional circumstances.
.In conclusion, the Government states that it is paying close attention to social reform in its meetings with the National Council of Trade Unions. The representatives on the Council have decided to set up Committees to study all social problems, in particular the Committee on Legislative Affairs which is to amend the relevant provisions with a view to securing the application of Conventions Nos.  and  in the legislation.
.The Committee notes that, in its reply, the Government has provided observations regarding the recommendations made by the Committee at its February  session on the allegations concerning the death of trade unionists, the dismissals which followed the general strike of  September  and the suspension of the legal personality of certain trade union organisations.
.In connection with the death of trade unionists, the Government observes that the institution of an inquiry does not lie within the competence of the Ministry of Labour but within that of the judiciary. The Committee wishes to explain in this connection that, in referring to the desirability of an impartial and independent inquiry into these incidents, it in no way claimed to question the prerogatives of the judiciary. On the contrary, the Committee considers that a regular legal procedure conducted by the competent courts would permit a fully objective and independent elucidation of the facts and determination of responsibility.
.As regards the dismissals the Committee notes that, according to the Government, a limited number of authorisations were granted following the general strike of  September . However, the Committee cannot but observe that the complainants have mentioned several hundred dismissals of workers and trade unionists; the ICFTU, in particular, referred to some  measures of this nature, indicating the names of the undertakings or the trade unions concerned, in an annex to its complaint. In cases where it has examined allegations of dismissals following strikes the Committee has considered that such measures involve serious risks of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association. It has also held the view that, on such occasions, the development of labour relations could be impaired as the result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action. In view of these considerations the Committee feels that it would be de s sir able for the Government to take measures to promote the reinstatement of the dismissed workers.
.As regards the measures concerning the legal personality of a number of trade union organisations, the Committee notes the Government's statement that the withdrawal of legal personality is a prerogative which belongs to the ordinary labour courts. The Committee has, in fact, noted that the most severe sanction which can be imposed on a trade union for contravention of the Labour Code - provided for under section  of the Code - is withdrawal of legal personality and dissolution of the union; this measure is taken by the labour courts at the request of the Ministry of Labour. Nevertheless, the Committee has also noted that, in the event of a strike being declared illegal, the ministry may decide to suspend the legal personality of a union for up to six months, and even to dissolve it (section ). In these circumstances the Committee must recall the importance which it attaches to the principle contained in Article  of Convention No.  that trade unions should not be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority. In order to secure proper compliance with this principle it would not be sufficient for legislation to provide for a right of appeal against administrative decisions; it would be necessary to stipulate that the latter should not become effective until the statutory period has expired without an appeal being lodged against such decisions or until they have been confirmed by a decision of the court. It is also important that judges should be able to enquire into the substance of the case.
.The Committee further considers that these principles are of special importance in the case of Colombia, since, under section  of the Labour Code, no industrial association may act as such or carry out the functions conferred on it by law and by its own rules or exercise its own rights without having been granted legal personality. Furthermore, it may function only for so long as such legal personality lasts. It follows that the suspension of legal personality of a trade union makes it impossible for it to promote and defend the interests of its members. In the light of these considerations the Committee feels it desirable that the Government should take the necessary steps to bring the legislation fully into conformity with the principles set forth above.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not communicated its observations as regards the arrests of trade unionists. In this connection it feels that it must again express its concern regarding the summary nature of the procedure laid down in Decree No. . In the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, the bringing of a detained person before the appropriate judge without delay is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to safeguard the exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) As",0,1977,Colombia
258,"regards the deaths of trade unionists, to draw the attention of the Government to the need for complete inquiries to be made in such cases in order to elucidate the facts and determine responsibility as indicated in paragraph  above;(b) as regards the measures of dismissal, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above and to suggest to in the desirability of taking the necessary steps to promote the reinstatement of the dismissed workers;(c) as regards the suspension of the legal personality of a number of trade unions or their dissolution, to request the Government to take the necessary steps to bring the legislation fully into conformity with Article  of Convention No. , according to which trade unions should not be suspended or dissolved by administrative authority, and to re-examine the situation of the trade unions which were dissolved on the occasion of the general strike of ;(d) as regards the arrests of workers and trade unionists, to reiterate its concern at the summary nature of the procedure provided for under Decree No.  and to request the Government to provide information on the present situation of the persons arrested during the general strike of ;(e) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaints and additional information presented by the complainants are contained in the following communications: a communication from the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) dated  September , three communications from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  and  November and  December , a communication from the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers dated  November , and two communications from the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees dated  November  and  January .
.These communications were transmitted to the Government as and when they were received. The Government furnished observations by a letter dated  October .
.Colombia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  September , the CLAT declared that in recent months there had been a series of violations of the trade union rights of workers and their organisations. According to the CLAT, this had been in response to the legitimate demands and action of the workers in the face of Colombia's galloping inflation, which made it impossible for them to survive with wages that were among the lowest in Latin America. The situation had reached such a point, it added, that all the trade union organisations of Colombia had, for the first time, decided to form a common front and to take joint action. In response, the Government had adopted Presidential Decree No.  which provided for prison sentences, fines and other sanctions for union officials and activists who were involved in the organisation of strikes and other legitimate activities.
.In reply to these initial allegations, the Government transmitted its observations in a letter dated  October . It stated that for reasons of internal public order - which was threatened by the strike of  September  - it had found itself obliged to take certain steps, specifically in connection with Decree No.  of  August , These steps, which were of a strictly preventive nature and had been widely publicised, provided for the justifiable dismissal of persons responsible for instigating, encouraging or promoting in any way the total or partial, continuous or staggered stoppage of occupational activities. The Government emphasised that these preventive measures were designed to counter the national strike of  September ; as had been clearly established by subsequent investigation the strike was not of an occupational nature but was intended to disrupt public order. As a result, there had been  innocent victims, public disturbances and damage to vehicles and business establishments.
.In more recent communications, the ICFTU stated that the social climate had deteriorated in Colombia, particularly since the middle of  and above all in September  when the Government had adopted extremely repressive tactics against workers and their union representatives. The complainant organisation continued that the action taken by the Government had led to the death, arrest and dismissal of a number of people who, following the instructions of their trade unions, had gone on strike to defend their economic interests. The Government had reacted extremely severely against a strike which should have been looked upon as normal. The ICFTU also enclosed a list of people who had been killed, imprisoned or dismissed as a result of the strike and the names of the trade union organisations whose legal personality had been suspended or withdrawn and which were thus deprived of any further possibility of taking legal action.
.The Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers also referred to the -hour general strike which had been called for  September  by the four trade union federations. The complainant organisation gave the names of several unions whose legal personality had been suspended by resolution of the Ministry of Labour and referred to the dismissal of a large number of workers, including officials of these organisations.
.The Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees referred in its complaint to restrictions on the trade union rights of several trade union organisations. The general strike of  September  had, it stated, been called to elicit a response from the Government to the workers' demands and had been organised by the other trade union federations of Colombia, with the participation of autonomous organisations of public servants such as the Inter-Union Committee of Workers in the Service of the State (CITE). The complainants alleged that, after the strike, over  workers had been reported as having been killed by government forces and hundreds of public servants and teachers had been dismissed. The sanctions and other steps taken had also involved union officials. The complainants gave the names of several officials who had been dismissed or laid off and of two others who had been condemned to two months' imprisonment for engaging in union activities.
.The Government has not replied to these allegations.
.In its communication of  September , the CLAT also drew attention to a number of connected events:- the suspension of the legal personality of the Manual Workers Trade Union (USO) in August  by administrative decision of the Ministry of Labour; the dismissal and imprisonment of activists and officials of this organisation;- the dismissal of workers at the Argos cement works in Medellin;- the arrest and harassment by the police of school teachers belonging to the Teachers Association of Antioquia (ADIDA);- the refusal of the Government to grant official recognition and legal personality to various unions which fulfilled the normal requirements laid down in the Labour Code; among these, the complainants referred to the Union of Printing and Paper Workers of Cundinamarca and the union that had been set up in the Indupalma company; furthermore, the legal personality of the Union of Public Enterprises of Medellin had been suspended.
.With respect to the dismissals and prison sentences referred to by the CLAT, the Government stated in its communication of  October  that, as in the case of the  September  strike, a situation had arisen which posed a threat to public order and which required the adoption of preventive measures and the taking of police action in order to defend the country's institutions. The Government further referred to the non-recognition of the legal personality of the Union of Workers in the Graphic Arts and Paper Industry of Cundinamarca and of the union which had been set up in the Indupalma company. It pointed out that, in the first case, the required minimum number of members had not been attained and that, in the second, the workers who had set up the union were not employed in the enterprise concerned.
.The case relates essentially to the alleged death, imprisonment, laying off or dismissal of a large number of union officials and activists and to the suspension, withdrawal or non-recognition of the legal personality of several union organisations. According to the complainants, these events occurred mainly, but not only, as a result of the -hour general strike that was organised on  September .
.According to available information, the Colombian Government adopted Decree No.  on strikes on  August . Under this decree and for the duration of the state of emergency, persons responsible for organising, leading, instigating, encouraging or promoting in any way the total or partial, continuous or staggered stoppage of normal occupational or other activities are liable to  to  days' imprisonment. The sentence can be passed by the governors, administrators and commissioners and by the mayor of the special district of Bogot by means of a resolution specifying the grounds therefor. These sanctions, or participation in the aforementioned work stoppages, are moreover considered to be reasonable grounds for dismissal. The Government",0,1977,Colombia
259,"confirmed that this Decree was adopted as a preventive measure in order to counter the national strike of  September.
.As already pointed out by the Committee, and specifically in a recent case, Convention No.  recognises the right of trade union organisations to formulate their programme of action and organise their activities; this entails not only the right to negotiate with employers but also the right to express their point of view on economic and social questions affecting their members' interests. In view of this right which trade unions are thus recognised as having, the Committee has always considered that the right to strike is an essential means whereby workers may promote and defend their occupational interests, while emphasising that strikes of a purely political nature do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association. As concerns claims of an economic nature, the right to strike should not be restricted solely to industrial disputes likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement. The Committee considers that workers and their organisations should be allowed to express in a broader context, if they so wish, their feelings with regard to economic and social matters affecting their interests, so long as such action consists merely in the expression of a protest, and does not lead to acts of violence.
.In this particular case, the complainants describe the  September  strike as an expression of protest by the workers and their organisations in the face of a serious deterioration in the social and economic situation of wage earners. The Government, on the other hand, claims that the action taken was not of an occupational nature but was intended to disrupt public order. The Committee observes that these two versions of the events, which were described in extremely brief terms, are totally contradictory.
.Whatever the case, the Committee can but note the severity of the methods employed in response to a -hour strike which seems to have been largely an expression of discontent by a great many workers, since it was organised by all the major tendencies of the Colombian trade union movement. The Committee feels that, if no steps are taken, the repercussions of this strike are liable to cause a lasting deterioration in industrial relations in the country.
.The Committee therefore wishes to point out, as it has done on previous occasions, that it would be particularly appropriate, in the case of the persons who lost their lives during the disturbances, that the Government should institute an impartial and independent inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and determine responsibility.
.With regard to the persons who had been arrested, Decree No.  of  August , which was adopted shortly before the national strike, provides inter alia for prison sentences in the case of collective stoppages of work and for those responsible to be judged by senior officials. According to the Committee, there is a danger that such a summary procedure might result in the taking of unfound decisions. Any trade unionist who has been arrested should be fully ensured the right of defence guaranteed by normal judicial procedure, as provided for by the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Furthermore, the Government has not supplied any information on the many people who, the complainants allege, have been arrested.
.Moreover, the Government has not supplied any detailed information regarding the union officials and activists who have been dismissed or laid off. In this connection, the Committee wishes to emphasise, as it has done in a previous case relating to Colombia, that general labour relations could be greatly improved if the employers concerned gave serious consideration to the possibility of reinstating the persons affected.
.Finally, the Committee has frequently been called upon to examine allegations in respect of Colombia concerning the non-recognition or suspension of the legal personality of trade union organisations (which is essential for them to function as such). In particular, it has drawn attention to the fact that the suspension or dissolution of a trade union by administrative authority is not in conformity with the principles of freedom of association, and on its recommendation the Governing Body has, in a previous case, urged the Government to take the necessary steps without delay to amend the provisions of the Labour code in that respect. Similarly, as regards the difficulties encountered by trade union organisations in their attempts to acquire legal personality through the authorities, it had recalled that, whilst it is true that the founders of a trade union must comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such a nature as to hamper freedom to form trade unions. Moreover, they should not be applied in such a way as to delay or prevent the setting up of occupational organisations. In the opinion of the Committee, these considerations and principles should once again be drawn to the attention of the Government in the present case.
.In general terms, basing its views on the considerations outlined in the foregoing paragraph, the Committee considers it desirable for the competent authorities to re-examine the situation of the trade unionists who have been sanctioned under the provisions of the aforementioned Decree No.  and the decision to suspend or withdraw the legal personality of various trade unions referred to by the complainants. The Committee also considers that it would be desirable if the authorities approached the employers concerned with a view to the reinstatement of the trade union members who have been dismissed.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations relating to the right to strike referred to in paragraph  and, specifically, to the fact that workers and their organisations should be allowed to express their feelings with regard to economic and social matters affecting their interests, on condition that such action consists merely in the expression of a protest and does not lead to acts of violence;(b) to suggest to the Government that it take the steps indicated by the Committee in paragraphs  and  (with respect to the death, arrest, dismissal or laying off of trade unionists and the non-recognition, suspension and withdrawal of the legal personality of trade union organisations) in order to restore a social climate that is more conducive to the development of good labour relations;(c) to request the Government to supply detailed information on all the points mentioned above;(d) to draw the Government's attention to the fact, noted in paragraph , that the legislative provisions regarding inter alia the suspension or withdrawal of the legal personality of trade union organisations are not entirely in conformity with the principles of freedom of association;(e) to take note of this interim report.",0,1977,Colombia
260,".The Committee last examined this case at its November  session, when it submitted interim conclusions in its th Report (paragraphs -). This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (November ).
.The allegations still outstanding concern the suspension of trade unions by administrative authority, the death of an indigenous leader, the arrest of a trade unionist and problems involving teachers and health workers. Since it last examined the case the Committee has received observations from the Government by a communication dated  January .
.Colombia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the suspension of trade unions by administrative authority:(i) to take note of the appointment of a drafting Committee for the Substantive and Procedural Labour Codes whose task is to prepare the amendments to the provisions relating to the dissolution and suspension of industrial associations so as to bring them into line with Convention No. ;(ii) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the death of one trade unionist and the arrest of another, to draw the Government's attention to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above and to ask it for information as to the punishment imposed on those responsible for the death of Mr. Justiniano Lama and as to the sentence pronounced in the case of Mr. Abel Pino;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the trade union rights of workers in the teaching profession:(i) to take note of the promulgation of new provisions with respect to the teaching profession;(ii) to draw the Government's attention to the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above;(iii) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case;(d) as regards the allegations relating to the trade union rights of health workers, to draw the attention of the Government and the complainants to the considerations set forth in paragraphs ,  and  above and, in particular, to suggest to the Government the desirability of its taking steps to facilitate the reinstatement of the dismissed workers.
.These cases were examined by the Committee at its sessions in May and November  and February . It presented interim conclusions on them in its th Report (paras. -), nd Report (paras. -) and th Report (paras. -). These reports were approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June ), th Session (November ) and th Session (February-March ). Further allegations have been made by the National Union of Health Workers ( May and  June ) since the case was last examined.
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations on the measures taken to reinstate in their employment a number of workers who were dismissed on the occasion of the  strike at the Colombian Social Insurance Institute. It expresses the hope that it will be possible to take further measures to promote the reinstatement of the other workers concerned. Finally, it notes the information furnished by the Government regarding the envisaged adoption of a new statute for the teaching profession. The Committee would like to be kept informed of any progress in this area.
.Regarding the allegations made by the Health Employees' Union ( May and  June ), which refer in particular to dismissals of trade union leaders, the Government's reply of  August  reached the Office on  October . This aspect of the case will be examined by the Committee at its next session.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to the undertaking Shellmar de Colombia, SA, to decide, in the light of the earlier conclusions reached by the Committee in its th Report, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the suspension of trade unions by administrative authority, to take note of the Government's statement that it has since  refrained from making use of these powers which are conferred upon it by the Labour Code, and to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of progress made in the current work to bring the legislation into conformity with Article  of Convention No. , which expressly forbids the suspension or dissolution of organisations by administrative authority;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the death of an indigenous leader and the arrest of a leader of the National Agrarian Federation, to take note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the judgements in these cases have not yet been rendered, and to request it to supply the texts of these judgements as soon as they become available, with the reasons adduced therefore;(d) to take note of the Government's observations on the re-instatement in their employment of a number of workers who were dismissed on the occasion of the  strike at the Colombian Social Insurance Institute, and to express the hope that it will be possible to adopt new measures to promote the reinstatement of the other workers concerned;(e) to take note of the Government's statement that work designed to secure the adoption of new statute for the teaching profession - with which workers' representatives have been associated - is continuing, and to request it to keep the Committee informed of any progress which may be made in this area; to note that the allegations relating to the dismissals of trade union leaders in the health sector and the Government's reply will be examined by the Committee at its next session;(f) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee has considered it appropriate to examine together the matters still outstanding in Case No.  and the allegations made in Case No. . The Government has furnished observations with respect to both cases in a communication dated  November .
.Colombia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body;(a) as regards the allegations relating to the death of the indigenous leader Justiniano Lame and the arrest of an official of the National Agrarian Federation:(i) to draw the Government's attention once again to the importance it attaches to the speedy and full elucidation of cases involving the death of a trade unionist and the threat to the exercise of trade union rights implied by the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found;(ii) to note that the trade union official arrested has been provisionally released;(iii) to request the Government once again to furnish as soon as possible the text of the judgements handed down in respect of both these cases;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the trade union rights of workers at the Colombian Social Insurance Institute and in the teaching profession:(i) to note that the right to bargain collectively has been granted by decree to the employees of the Institute to whom the complaint refers, and to request the Government once again to forward its observations on the allegations to the effect that over  trade union officials and workers were dismissed as a consequence of a strike in ;(ii) to request the Government once more to supply information on the results of the new study which, according to an earlier communication from the Government, was being made of the situation of workers in the teaching profession;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the suspension of industrial associations within the Colombian Mineral water Enterprise, to draw the Government's attention, in accordance with the considerations set forth in paragraph  above, to the desirability of amending the provisions of the legislation relating to the suspension or dissolution of industrial associations so as to bring them fully into line with Article  of Convention No. ; to note that the Government proposes to refer a commission to the Committee's recommendations on the harmonising of its legislation with that article, and to request the Government in the meantime to indicate whether an appeal lies to the courts against administrative decisions as at present provided for, specifying also what is the effect of an appeal, and by what provisions the matter is governed;(d) as regards the allegations relating to the undertaking Shellmar de Colombia, S.A.:(i) to note the information supplied by the Government concerning the arrangement concluded between the parties with",0,1977,Colombia
261,".Case No.  was examined by the Committee in May , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since this examination of the case by the Committee, no further communications have been received from either the complainants or the Government.
.Guatemala has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), acting on behalf of its affiliated organisations, the National Central of Workers (CNT) and the Central American Confederation of Workers (CCT), alleged in October  that for more than a year the Government had refused to grant legal status to the trade union of the ""La Florida"" bus consortium, although the union had complied with all the necessary legal formalities. Furthermore, the CLAP added, the firm had illegally dismissed the entire executive Committee of the union as well as  workers.
.In its reply, the Government denied the accusations made against it. First of all, it stated that in the Public Register of Trade Unions there was no recognised trade union organisation with legal status by the name of National Central of workers. It added that all applications for legal status and for the registration of union executives were examined in accordance with the statutory procedure, without discrimination. It stated that in accordance with the relevant law, an application for legal status from the trade union of ""La Florida"" consortium was being considered. As regards the dispute of the workers of ""La Florida"" urban bus company, the Government stated that the General Inspectorate of Labour took the action incumbent upon it by law and that the workers initiated proceedings in the courts whose final decision was awaited.
.In its examination of the case, the Committee noted that it was more than a year since the union of workers of the ""La Florida"" bus consortium had filed its application for the grant of legal status and that this considerable delay, which was unexplained by the Government, was in itself an impediment to the freedom to form workers' organisations which is one of the cornerstones of freedom of association. On the subject of the dismissal of all the members of the unions executive Committee and of other workers, the Committee stated that this was a serious step which, in view of its sweeping nature, might lead one to presume that it had been taken for anti-union reasons.
.In the circumstances the Governing Body, at its session in June , at the recommendation of the Committee, drew the Government's attention to the considerations and principles established by the Committee concerning the legal requirements for the foundation of a trade union and requested it to communicate as soon as possible the decision taken by the authorities concerning the granting of legal status to the union of workers of the ""La Florida"" bus consortium. The Governing Body also emphasised the importance of a speedy procedure for the examination of complaints alleging anti-union practices and requested the Government to supply the texts of the judgements pronounced, and the grounds adduced therefore, in the case of the dismissal of all the members of the executive Committee of the union in question and of other workers.
.At its meetings in November  and in February and May , the- Committee postponed consideration of the case since it had not received the observations requested from the Government. At its session in November , the Committee again postponed examination of the case for the same reasons and, as a result, the Governing Body informed the Government that at its next session, in accordance with its procedure, the Committee would present a report on the substance of the matter even if the Government's observations had not been received. The Committee has still not received this information.
.In the circumstances, and before examining the substance of the case, the Committee considers it necessary to recall the considerations which it set forth in its first report, and which it has reiterated on a number of occasions: the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such dot-ailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.The Committee regrets that the Government has not sent the observations which have repeatedly been requested and that, in view of the time that has elapsed, it is obliged to examine the case without these observations.
.As regards the allegations concerning the request for legal status from the union of the ""La Florida"" bus consortium, the Committee is obliged to recall that on previous occasions it has stated that the prescribing of formalities for the Constitution of trade unions was not incompatible with the principles of freedom of association. It has nevertheless emphasised that formalities as to publicity or other similar formalities must not be such as to be equivalent in practice to previous authorisation, or as to constitute such an obstacle to the establishment of an organisation that they amount in practice to outright prohibition. In two specific cases in which a considerable period of time had elapsed since two trade union organisations had applied for legal status, the Committee recalled that, while it is true that the founders of a trade union must comply with the formalities prescribed by legislation, these formalities should not be of such nature as to hamper freedom to form organisations.
.At the time of the present examination of the case, the Government has not informed the Committee whether a decision has been reached regarding the application for legal status by the union of the ""La Florida"" bus consortium. However, the time which has elapsed since the application was made and until the time the last communication was received from the Government is already sufficient to indicate that the proceedings regarding this request have been unduly slow, thus constituting, as the Committee notes in its previous report, an obstacle to the freedom to form a workers' organisation which is one of the cornerstones of freedom of association.
.As regards the dismissal of workers, the Committee notes that this measure affected all the members of the executive Committee of the trade union of the company. Since this was a general measure, and in the absence of other information, it can be presumed that it was adopted for anti.-union reasons. The Committee has considered that one of the fundamental principles of freedom of association is that workers should enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment such as dismissal it has established that the existence in legislation of basic provisions prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination is not sufficient if these provisions are not accompanied by effective procedures ensuring their application in practice. When examining a case concerning Guatemala which involved allegations of anti-union dismissal practices against members of unregistered trade unions, the Committee noted that Guatemalan legislation contained a number of provisions designed to protect workers against acts of anti-union discrimination but that there were grounds for doubting whether in fact adequate protection against such acts had been provided. In the present case the Committee reiterates its concern.
.In view of all these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its regret that, despite the requests made, the Government had not sent the information for which it had been asked; and that it was forced to examine the case without the benefit of the comments of the Government;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  and , particularly concerning the fact that unduly slow procedure constitutes an obstacle to the free establishment of trade union organisations;(c) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set out in paragraph  concerning protection against acts of anti-union discrimination;(d) to urge the Government to keep the Committee informed on the outcome of the application for legal status from the union of the ""La Florida"" bus consortium and of the proceedings concerning the dismissal of the executive Committee of the said union and of other workers from the company.
.The complaint of the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) is contained in a letter dated  October . The Government forwarded its comments by a communication dated  February .
.Guatemala has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The CLAT, acting on behalf of its affiliated organisations, the National Central of Workers (CNT) and the Central American Confederation of Workers (CCT), complained that Guatemalan workers had been subjected to repression. It also claimed that the Government disregarded the most elementary trade union rights and freedoms and had refused for more than a year to grant legal personality to the union",0,1977,Guatemala
262,"of employees of the ""La Florida"" Bus Consortium, although the union had complied with all the necessary formalities.
.Furthermore, continued the CLAT, the firm had illegally dismissed the entire executive Committee of the union as well as  employees of the undertaking.
.In its reply the Government denies the accusations made against it. It begins by stating that in the register of trade unions there is no recognised trade union organisation with legal personality by the name of the National Central of Workers (CNT). It adds that freedom of association exists in Guatemala under the law since it is a country governed by its laws; every application for the granting of legal personality and for the registration of a union executive is examined in accordance with the statutory procedure, without discrimination. Thus  trade unions were granted legal personality in . An application from the union of employees of the ""La Florida"" Consortium is now being considered, in accordance with the law, by the National Department for the Protection of Workers. In the documents appended by the Government to its communication it is stated that the file on the application has been transmitted to the General Inspectorate of Labour.
.According to these documents, the General Inspectorate of Labour intervened in the industrial dispute between the representatives of the urban bus company ""La Florida"" and the dismissed workers. Appropriate warnings were issued, and since they remained without effect an appeal was lodged with the competent judicial body. The workers concerned, knowing full well that the labour inspectorate had no power of coercion to compel the undertaking to reinstate the dismissed employees, initiated proceedings in the labour and social welfare courts, whose final decision is now awaited. It is pointed out that the General Inspectorate of Labour examines all industrial disputes in accordance with the statutory provisions, having regard in particular to the general principles of the labour law.
.The Committee notes that it is more than a year since the union of employees of the ""La Florida"" Bus Consortium filed its application for the granting of legal personality, which it must have in order to be able to function as a trade union. This considerable delay, unexplained by the Government, constitutes in itself an impediment to the freedom to form workers' organisations which is one of the cornerstones of freedom of association. While the Committee has, in a number of cases, found it acceptable that certain formalities, relating-to publicity in particular, should have to be observed in connection with the formation of a trade union, it has added that such requirements must not be such as to be equivalent, in law or in practice, to previous authorisation. In this connection Article  of Convention No.  provides that workers shall have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation, and Article  stipulates that the acquisition of legal personality by organisations shall not be made subject to conditions of such a character as to restrict the application of the provisions, in particular of Article .
.As for the dismissal by the employer of all the members of the union's executive Committee, as well as other employees, this is a serious step the sweeping nature of which might lead one to presume that it was taken for anti-union reasons. In other cases relating to Guatemala, the Committee has already had to examine similar allegations concerning anti-union practices directed against members of unregistered company employees' unions, and in some cases the actual disappearance of the unions in question. The Committee noted in particular, in connection with one of these cases, that Guatemalan legislation contained a number of provisions designed to protect workers against acts of anti-union discrimination, but that, in practice, it was doubtful that adequate protection against such acts in fact existed.
.In the present instance, the workers concerned have lodged an appeal with the courts against the measures taken against them. It is important that this appeal should be heard within the shortest possible time; in fact, should the employer be found to be at fault, but belatedly, serious harm might be done to the interests of the workers concerned, and their union, being for company employees only, might even disappear altogether.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraph  with respect to the legal requirements for the foundation of a trade union, and to request the Government to communicate as soon as possible the decision taken by the authorities concerning the granting of legal personality to the union of employees of the ""La Florida"" Bus Consortium;(b) to emphasise the importance of a speedy procedure for the examination of complaints alleging anti-union practices and to request the Government to supply the text of the judgements pronounced, and the grounds adduced therefor, with regard to the dismissal of all the members of the executive Committee of the union in question and of other workers;(c) to take note of this interim report.",0,1977,Guatemala
263,".The Committee has considered it advisable to examine the allegations remaining outstanding in Case No.  together with the allegations presented in Case No. . The Government has submitted observations and further information in respect of both matters in two letters dated  and  January .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with respect to both cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest the further information communicated by the Government, according to which at the present time no trade union leader is under arrest for reasons connected with the general strike of  July , nor in connection with other trade union activities;(b) to note also the measure of amnesty and general pardon decreed by the Government and affecting all those being tried or having been sentenced in connection with the said strike, and to decide, in the circumstances, that there would be no point in continuing to examine this aspect of the case;(c) to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of the steps taken to reconsider the situation of the workers who were dismissed as a result of the strike and to restore free collective bargaining;(d) as regards the allegations concerning the expulsion from the country of the Venezuelan trade unionist, Luis Hernndez, and in view of the information communicated by the complainants and by the Government, to decide that these allegations call for no further examination but to draw the attention of both parties to the principles and considerations set out in paragraph  above.
.The following organisations sent communications containing allegations of violations of trade union rights in Peru on the dates indicated below: World Federation of Trade Unions ( and  July,  August,  October ); World Confederation of Labour (,  and  July,  August ); Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Central American Workers (CPUSTAL) ( July ); Latin American Central of Workers ( July ); General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP) and National Confederation of Workers (CNT) ( July ); Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers ( August,  September,  October ); National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers of Peru ( October ); Union of Workers of the commercial Services Enterprise SA ""Sermer"" ( October ). The Government sent its comments in a communication of  November .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations presented by the various complainant organisations mainly concern the general strike organised in Peru on  July  and its consequences for the trade union organisations, their leaders and their active members.
.A number of the complainant organisations stated that the general strike had been called in protest against rising prices and for the purpose of obtaining wage increases. The General Confederation of Workers of Peru (CGTP) and the National Confederation of Workers (CNT) explain in this connection that the Government adopted an economic recovery programme in June . This programme provided among other things for the abolition of subsidies on food products, an increase in the price of fuel, a reduction in public expenditure and a wage freeze. According to these complainant organisations the Government wished to impose this programme under the ""state of emergency"" which was in force in the country, and under which strikes were forbidden. The trade union organisations rigorously rejected this economic programme. The general discontent resulting from this policy and from various other measures (Decree No. . TR permitting the dismissal of workers who held up production; arrests and deportations of trade union leaders), provoked a number of reactions from the trade unions. Large demonstrations held in the main cities of Peru were put down by the police, and Workers were killed, injured or arrested.
.In Lima the legally recognised trade union organisations, including three Confederations - CGTP, CNT and the central of Workers of the Peruvian Revolution (CTRP)(Lima section) and a number of autonomous federations - called a general -hour protest strike on  July . This movement was organised, stated the complainants and in particular CLAT, when all legal and technical means of redress had been exhausted and no satisfactory reply had been given by the authorities. According to the complainants the workers gave massive support to the strike and behaved in a disciplined and organised manner. Generally speaking, it was peaceful despite clashes outside the city between the navy and the inhabitants of the suburbs.
.The CNT and the CLAT pointed out in this connection that the clashes in question had caused the deaths of six workers. The CGTP and the CNT for their part alleged that seven persons had lost their lives and that a number had been injured.
.All the complainant organisations referred to the numerous arrests of trade union leaders and active members which had taken place on the occasion of the general strike. The CNT stated in its communication of  August  that the number of workers arrested was ,. The CNT and the CLAT referred to the arrests made before the calling of the strike (on  July ) of Luis Hernndez, General Secretary of the Trade Union Council of Andean Workers, a sub-regional organisation of the CLAT and the CNT for the countries of the Andean group. The CLAT stated that this trade union leader had been extradited to Venezuela. The General Secretary of the CGTP, Eduardo Castillo, had been arrested on  July as he was leaving the headquarters of his organisation for discussions with the authorities at a meeting to which he had been called by a military leader. The following day, the General Secretary of the CNT, Victor Snchez Zapata, was arrested in his turn. Many other leaders of the CGTP, the CNT, the CTRP, federations and first-degree organisations had also been detained. According to the WFTU, the Ministry of the Interior had announced its intention to take legal action against the leaders of the organisations participating in the strike. The WFTU also stated that among those arrested were workers in the mines in the centre and the south of the country as well as in the industrial zones of Lima. In its communication of  October , the WFTU stated that the general secretaries of the CGTP and the CNT had been released but that other leaders and workers remained under arrest.
.The Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, stated that over  leaders in the food and drink sector had been arrested. Among them is Silverio Velsquez, Chairman of the Federation of Mineral Water and Allied Workers of Peru and Chairman of the Latin American Confederation of Food Workers. In its communication of  October  the complainant organisation stated that these trade union leaders had been released but that they were awaiting judgement.
.The National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers also referred to the arrest and deportation of trade union leaders. According to this organisation the only crime they had committed was to represent and defend the rights and interests of the workers. The complainant did not say whether or not the measures had been taken in connection with the strike of  July . The following persons were also mentioned as having been arrested; Csar Barrera Bazn, General Secretary of SUTEP; Agustin Ponce Nnez, General Secretary of the Breweries Federation; Victor Diaz Arcelles, Secretary of the Mines Federation of Centromin; Cornelio Rivera Trinidad, General Secretary of the Federation of Mines and Metallurgy of Central Peru; Jos Escudo Torres, General Secretary of the Federation of the Building, Construction Materials and Allied Industries, and Jsus Martinez Lajos, General Secretary of the Workers Union of Toquepala. Jos Sono and Luis Martinez, officials of the Nylon Workers Union, were wanted by the authorities. The following officials had been deported: Victor Cuadros Paredes, General Secretary of the National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers; Julian Sierra Corrales, Organisation Secretary of the Federation of Metallurgical Industry Workers, and Hugo Blanco, official of the Peruvian Peasant Confederation.
.The complainant organisations also alleged that trade union premises, specifically those of the CGTP, the CNT, the CTRP and Book Federation, were occupied by the police.
.A number of complaints denounced the promulgation of the Government of Presidential Decree No. . TR on  July . This Decree allows enterprises in the public and private sectors to break the labour contracts of the trade union leaders responsible for the national strike of  July for a period of  days. According to the National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers of Peru the adoption of the Decree in question followed on other provisions adopted since the launching of the economic recovery plan in June . Thus, the Government passed on  August , Presidential Decree No. . TR which forbade",0,1977,Peru
264,".By a telegram dated  December , the World Confederation of Labour presented a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Paraguay. The contents of this communication were transmitted to the Government, and at the request of the WCL the Director-General personally sent a telegram to the Government, which forwarded its observations on  March .
.Paraguay has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCL's communication stated that the police had arrested  trade union officials in Paraguay. These included Rodolfo Romero, Emilio Valenti, Victoriano Centurin, Florencio Rivero and Fulgencio Barreiro. According to other information communicated by the WCL, the officials arrested on  December  were the leaders of the National Central of Workers in Urban Sectors (CNTU). The two first named occupied respectively the posts of Director of the WCL's Regional Training institute and official in charge of training for peasants.
.In its communication the Government states that the persons named in the complaint were deprived of their liberty for breaches of Act No. /, respecting the defence of democracy and the public peace. They were prosecuted, and in February  they were all set at liberty after final judgements had been pronounced.
.The Committee notes with interest that the trade unionists mentioned in the WCL's complaint have been released in pursuance of court decisions. The Committee must, however, express its regret that the Government has supplied no information as to the precise grounds on which the persons in question were originally arrested.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest that the trade unionists mentioned in the complaint are now at liberty;(b) to decide that, in view of this fact, no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of the case.",0,1977,Paraguay
265,"all work stoppages during the state of emergency and authorised undertakings to rescind the labour contracts of those who disregarded this prohibition. The Legislative Decrees adopted in  had also suspended the right to stability of employment in a number of sectors: press undertakings (Legislative Decree No.  of  March ); fisheries sector (Legislative Decree No. ); undertakings belonging to ""Editora Peru"" (Legislative Decree No.  of  March ); mines sector (Legislative Decree No.  of  March ). The National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers also stated that the Presidential Decree No. . TR permitting the dismissal of those responsible for the general strike of  July, claimed to derive its authority for doing so from a higher source, namely Legislative Decree No. , which guarantees the right to stability of employment. The Presidential Decree also infringed the principle of non-retroactivity of the law, since it punished by dismissal acts committed before its promulgation.
.As regards the application of the Legislative Decree, the WFTU reported in its communication of  August  that according to the Peruvian press  trade union leaders and active members had been dismissed. The Ministry of Industry and Tourism was said to have dismissed  trade union leaders working in state enterprises. Similar measures had been adopted following a strike called on  July by the workers of the Centromin state undertaking. Sixteen workers accused of having organised the strike had been dismissed. In its communication of  October , the WFTU estimates the number of workers dismissed under this Decree at ,.
.The Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers noted that over , workers and trade union leaders in the food sector were without work. Among those dismissed was the General Secretary of the Federation of Mineral Water and Allied Workers of Peru, Silverio Velasquez. The Union of Workers of the Commercial Services Enterprise SA ""Sermer"" provided a list of  workers of this undertaking who had been dismissed.
.In its complaint the National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers made other allegations, mainly regarding the right to collective bargaining. On this point the complainant organisation referred to Legislative Decree No.  of  June  to institute ""maximum wages"". On  January  the Government promulgated Legislative Decree No.  which limited workers' claims to demands for wage increases. Thanks to the action of the workers, Legislative Decree No.  was adopted one month later; this Decree, which remained in force until  December , authorised claims relating to working conditions provided that they were designed to facilitate work and improve the protection of the worker on the job. Despite this restrictive clause the workers managed to conclude agreements improving their conditions of work. Nevertheless these agreements were counselled by the administrative authorities. Following the adoption of the economic recovery plan, Legislative Decree No.  was promulgated; this extended the validity of agreements from one year to  months and suspended automatic readjustments to pay during . Although Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  subsequently abolished certain restrictions (maximum wages) and granted certain advantages, they did not, according to the complainant organisation, make up for the drastic rise in the cost of living.
.The National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical workers also complained of refusals to recognise independent trade union organisations or associations of officials (sole union of educational workers, maritime industrial service, military uniforms, post and telecommunications, social security); the indefinite delay in the procedures for recognising trade unions; and failure to recognise the representative ness of independent trade union organisations (National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers, Federation of Peruvian Fishermen).
.In its reply the Government first gave a picture of the economic and social situation in the country. Under the economic programme for  it had been necessary, it explained, to take certain austerity measures in the field of public expenditure in order to reduce the budgetary deficit and inflationary pressures. Furthermore, in order to compensate for the reduction in the purchasing power of workers in the public and private sectors, successive wage increases had been instituted by decree, taking account of the country's economic and financial capacity and the economic stability programme. In addition, in order not to paralyse production at a time when the country needed all its material and human resources to overcome the crisis, the Government promulgated Legislative Decree No. ..TR prohibiting for the duration of the state of emergency all forms of collective work stoppages such as go-slows and strikes, including strikes of short duration. The legal and administrative provisions governing such matters would come back into force once a normal situation had been re-established in the country. The Legislative Decree authorised employers to break labour contracts of workers infringing these provisions. Likewise, employers who provoked work stoppages in undertakings would be liable to the maximum fines provided for by the law.
.Following the adoption of these measures, continued the Government, the executives of some trade union Confederation (CGTP and CNT), in response to anti-patriotic instructions from foreign organisations, had decided to declare a general strike on  July . This decision had been supported neither by the affiliates of these Confederations nor by the workers. The leadership of the Confederations then embarked on a reign of intimidation and, on the day of the strike, prevented the workers from moving around freely by setting up road-blocks and stoning and burning public transport vehicles. The police were obliged to intervene to maintain order, and the premises of the Confederations had to be occupied as they were serving as bases for groups of agitators.
.As regards the arrest of trade union leaders, the Government stated that after the strike was called it had summoned the General Secretaries of CGTP and CNT to a meeting. No force had been employed against them. The General Secretary of the Council of Andean Workers, Luis Hernndez, of Venezuelan nationality, who had entered Peru for contacts with the Council's affiliate organisations, was arrested at Cuzco while engaged in political agitation. He was taken to Lima, from where he left for Caracas on  July .
.For the reasons given above, the strike was partially successful and had serious repercussions on the national economy. Nevertheless, the highest cost was in human lives, for which the agitators were directly responsible. Since the purpose of the strike was clearly political, the Government was obliged to promulgate Presidential Decree No. ..TR which authorised public and private enterprises to dismiss within a period of  days workers who were proved to have been ring-leaders in the strike. It was not the Government's intention either to undermine stability of employment or to caution the abusive application of the Decree. This being so, the Ministry of Labour had been asked to make a thorough investigation of all the dismissals in order to ascertain whether they had been carried out in agreements with the spirit and the letter of the Decree. In cases where there was proof that the dismissals had been unjustified, orders had been issued for the immediate reinstatement of the persons concerned and the enterprises had been severely punished. Furthermore, under Presidential Decree No. ..TR, undertakings in the private sector which had dismissed workers had been obliged within  days to engage a number of workers at least equal to the number of workers dismissed and to report on the matter to the Ministry of Labour. Identical measures were adopted for the public sector under Legislative Decree No. .
.In conclusion the Government stated that:- the strike held on  July  was illegal and caused serious damage to the national economy;- the intervention of the forces of order had been due to the need to prevent and check abuses committed by the agitators;- trade union premises had been temporarily occupied as a preventive measures;- the arrests of some workers had not been due to their trade union or occupational activities but had been provoked by their flagrant attacks on public order or against the safety of the lives and property of individuals;- no trade union leaders or workers were at present being detained on account of their trade union activities;- the extradition of Luis Hernndez had been ordered because he was engaging in subversive activities;- the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. ..TR had been a transitional measure designed to check sabotage to production at a time of national crisis;- measures had been taken to guarantee the workers' rights and to prevent abuses on the part of the employers.
.The present case concerns essentially the general strike organised on  July  by CGTP, CNT and various other Peruvian trade union organisations. The action resulted in the deaths of certain workers during clashes with the forces of order, the arrest of trade union leaders and militants, the dismissal of large numbers of workers under special regulations adopted by the Government, and the occupation of trade union premises.
.The Committee notes that strikes took place while the country was in a ""state of emergency"", during which collective work stoppages had",0,1977,Peru
266,"been forbidden. This made the strike illegal under the national legislation. The Government justifies this general strike prohibition by the need to find a remedy to the country's present economic crisis. In this connection the Committee considers that, since a general prohibition of strikes is an important restriction of one of the essential means by which the workers and their organisations can promote and defend their occupational interests, such a prohibition would only be justified if imposed in a situation of acute national emergency and even then only as a transitory measure. In this connection the Committee notes that the state of emergency was declared in , while the national strike was called one year later, in July , for a duration of  hours only. Moreover, both the state of emergency and the strike prohibition resulting from it were ended a short while later, on  August .
.The Committee also observes that the objectives of the strike are defined differently by the Government and the complainants. For the Government the designs pursued by the organisers of the movement were clearly political. The Committee remarks, however, that the Government supplies no particulars which would enable the strike to be categorised as a political one. The complainants, on the other hand, insist on its occupational and trade union nature. The Committee notes in this connection that the strike notices signed by the organising Confederations protest against the Government's economic policy and the rise in prices, and claim wage increases. In addition, the Government itself recognises that it had been obliged austerity measures under its economic policy. The Committee has had occasion in the past to deal with a similar case concerning a general strike of  hours in support of claims certain of which were patently of an occupational nature. The Committee recalled that the prohibition of strikes designed to coerce the Government, if they are not occupational in character, does not constitute an infringement of freedom of association, and that strikes of a purely political nature do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association. Nevertheless, the Committee considered that workers and their organisations should be allowed to express, if they so wished, any feelings they may have as concerns economic and social matters affecting their interests, so long as such action consists merely in the expression of a protest. The Committee must, however, add that it is important that movements of this kind are not such as to result in acts of violence.
.As regards the deaths of workers during clashes with the forces of order, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the responsibility lies with agitators. The Government does not, however, supply particulars of the circumstances in which these events took place. The Committee recalls in this connection that in a number of cases in the paste in which dispersal of public meetings or demonstrations by the police have involved loss of life, the Committee has attached great importance to the circumstances being fully investigated by an immediate and impartial inquiry and to the regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification and responsibility for the action taken by the police. The Committee would like to know whether such an inquiry has been undertaken and, if so, to learn its result.
.As regards the arrest of trade union militants and leaders, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these measures were not due to the occupational or trade union activities of the persons concerned but were provoked by their attacks on the safety of persons and property. It also notes that, still according to the Government, no trade union leaders are at present being held on account of their trade union activities. Nevertheless, the Committee observes that certain complainant organisations have stated that the arrested trade unionists are awaiting judgement, although a number of them have been released, including the General Secretaries of the CGTP and the CNT. In these circumstances, while noting with interest that some of the trade unionists have been released, the Committee would like to Government to indicate whether certain of the trade unionists arrested during the strike of  July  are still under arrest and whether they will be brought before the courts. The Committee would, however, like to stress that massive arrest of strikers involves serious risk of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association.
.One of the complainant organisations, the National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers, mentions that certain trade union leaders have been arrested, are wanted by the police or have been deported, without stating whether these measures were connected with the strike of  July . Since the Government has not replied on this point, the Committee would like it to transmit its observations.
.Regarding the extradition of Luis Hernndez, General Secretary of the Trade Union Council of Andean Workers, the Government indicate in a general way that he was engaged in subversive activities. The Committee would like the Government to supply particulars of the activities carried out in Peru by the trade union leader in question and which led to his extradition.
.The dismissals which followed the strike of  July  were pronounced under exceptional regulations which allowed undertakings to annul the employment contracts of the ring-leaders of the movement. The Ministry of Labour conducted an inquiry with a view to ascertaining whether the regulations had been observed. It appears that a very large number of workers lost their jobs. In these circumstances it may be asked whether the dismissals affected only the organisers and instigators of the strike or whether large numbers of workers were not dismissed merely for taking part in it. It would appear that according to the information provided the Government discovered a large number of cases of unjustified dismissal.
.The Committee has already examined a number of cases of massive dismissals following strikes and has considered that such measures involve serious risks of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association. It has also held the view that, on such occasions, the development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action. In view of these considerations and those set forth in paragraph  regarding protest action by the workers, the Committee feels that it would be desirable for the Government to take measures to re-examine the situation of all the dismissed workers with a view to their reinstatement.
.Regarding the occupation of trade union premises by the forces of order, the Government indicates that these measures were temporary and were taken preventively. On this point the Committee wishes to recall that in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th Session (), the International Labour Conference considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties essential for the normal exercise of trade union rights.
.One of the complaints referred to various decrees promulgated since  for the purpose of regulating collective bargaining. The aim of these decrees was to fix wage ceilings to limit claims to demands for wage increases and exclude claims relating to conditions of work and finally to extend validity of the collective agreements in force. Subsequently Legislative Decree No.  of  August  abolished the establishment of a ceiling for wage increases. Under this Legislative Decree collective agreements, administrative labour resolutions and arbitration awards may provide for a general wage increase on the basis of an economic and financial evaluation of the undertaking, but may not deal with other points.
.The Committee is fully aware that, in certain circumstances, governments may consider that the economic situation in their country may at times call for stabilisation measures which make it impossible for the wage rates to be freely fixed by collective bargaining. The Committee nevertheless feels that such restrictions should constitute exceptional measures. The Committee also holds the view that trade union organisations should have the opportunity to negotiate conditions of employment. In these circumstances the Committee considers that a major objective of the Government should be the restoration of free collective bargaining. The Committee also wishes to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case.
.The National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers presented allegations relating to the refusal to recognise trade union organisations of officials and through the non-recognition of the representative ness of other organisations (National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers, Federation of Peruvian Fishermen). The Committee has already dealt in recent cases with allegations relating to the situation of organisations of officials and the Federation of Peruvian Fishermen. In each of these cases it reached interim conclusions at its session in November . In particular, the Committee recommended the Governing Body to urge the Government to take steps to ensure recognition of the free exercise of trade union rights for all workers in",0,1977,Peru
267,"the public sector. Consequently, the Committee would like the Government to send its observations regarding the recognition of the representative ness of the other organisation mentioned by the complainant, namely the National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs - and - above respecting the general strike of  July , and in particular to the principle according to which workers and their organisations should be allowed to express, if they so wish, any feelings they may have as concerns economic and social matters affecting their interests, on condition that such action consists merely in the expression of a protest, and does not lead to acts of violence;(b) to note with interest that certain trade unionists have been released, in particular the General Secretaries of the CGTP and the CNT;(c) to request the Government to indicate whether an inquiry has been conducted into the deaths of workers during clashes with the police and, if so, to communicate the results; to indicate whether certain trade unionists arrested during the strike of  July  are still in detention and whether they will be brought before the courts; to communicate its observations on the subject of the measures of arrest, search and deportation taken against the trade union leaders mentioned in paragraph  above, and to supply details on the activities for which Mr. Luis Hernndez was extradited;(d) for the reasons indicated in paragraph  above, to point out to the Government that it would be desirable for it to take measures to re-examine the situation of all the dismissed workers with a view to their reinstatement;(e) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above concerning collective bargaining, to point out that a major objective should be to restore free collective bargaining, and to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case;(f) to request the Government to communicate its observations regarding the allegations concerning the non-recognition of the representative ness of the National Federation of Mining and Metallurgical Workers;(g) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1977,Peru
268,".The Committee examined this case at its November  Session, or which occasion it presented an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since then, the Government has sent information in a communication dated  May .
.Following the examination of the case by the Committee, one of the allegations of the complainants remained outstanding, namely, the measure taken against Julin Sierra Corales, the Organisation Secretary of the Federation of Peruvian Metalworkers, who had been exiled to Panama on  December . The measure had been taken after he had been imprisoned for over  days on a charge - which, according to the Peruvian General Confederation of Workers (CGTP), was false and arbitrary - of attempting to ""sabotage increased production"". This charge, brought by Sierra Corales' employer, had not been investigated under any form of administrative or judicial procedure.
.At its November  Session, the Committee had noted that the Government had not made any comments on this subject. In general terms, the Committee recalled the importance which it attached to the fact that, in cases of exile of trade unionists, such measures should be accompanied by full legal safeguards and should not result from the legitimate trade union activities of those concerned. On the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body accordingly requested the Government to send its observations on the matter.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that, on  March , an official communiqu No. /ORRPPMI rescinded all provisions designed to prevent the return to the country of Peruvians living abroad. The object of this measure was to ensure that the entire population was able to participate in the election of the Constituent Assembly.
.The Committee takes note of this information. It is apparent from the Government's reply that Julin Sierra Corales is in a position to return to Peru. The Committee regrets, however, that the Government does not provide any details on the grounds for his exile and wishes to emphasise, as it has in similar cases, that a measure exiling trade unionists, which is in violation of human rights, is particularly grave, since it deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and of contacts with their families. It is also in violation of freedom of association in that it undermines trade union organisations which are thereby deprived of their leaders.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, in the light of the Government's reply, and bearing in mind the principles and considerations set forth in the previous paragraph, that no purpose would be served in pursuing its examination of this case.
.In communications dated respectively  January,  February and  February  the Peruvian General Confederation of Workers (CGTP), the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) presented complaints alleging the violation of trade union rights in Peru.
.The texts of these communications were transmitted to the Government, which sent observations in a communication dated  September .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint the Peruvian General Confederation of Workers alleged that the Organisation Secretary of the Federation of Peruvian Metalworkers, Julin Sierra Corrales, had been exiled to Panama on  December . This measure, stated the Confederation, had been taken after he had been imprisoned for over  days on a charge - which according to CGTP was false and arbitrary - of attempting to ""sabotage increased production"". This charge, brought by Mr. Sierra Corrales's employer, was not investigated under any form of administrative or judicial procedure.
.As for the CLAT, it stated, in its complaint, presented in the name of its affiliates, the Latin American Confederation of Communication Workers and the Sole Federation of Postal and Telecommunication Workers of Peru (FUTT), that Peruvian workers were passing through a difficult period and that the basic rights laid down in the national legislation and in international Conventions were being violated.
.According to CLAT, on  June  the FUTT presented a statement of minimum claims to the Ministry of Transport and Communications. When their representations proved fruitless the workers decided to call a -hour strike for  December . This was followed by severe repression, during which union officials and their wives were arrested, homes were searched and relatives subjected to humiliating and abusive treatment.
.These events, according to CLAT, forced the FUTT to call a general strike of unlimited duration. The Director-General of Communications undertook to resume discussions and to seek an agreement if the workers went back to work on  December . Although the situation then returned to normal, not only was the agreement refused but all the trade union officials and many telecommunication workers were arbitrarily dismissed. The CLAT attached various documents in support of its statements, in particular lists of persons arrested (trade union officials and their relatives), nine of whom were still under arrest; a report on the health of the Organisation Secretary of the FUTT stating that he suffered from pains in the lumbar region and lower limbs during his arrest; bulletins from the Directorate of Posts and Telegraphs prohibiting meetings at the workplace and refusing leave of absence; and a list of  persons who had been dismissed for taking part in the strike (the list stated that the total number of those dismissed was about ).
.Finally, the CLAT referred to Presidential Resolution No. - TC/CO of  January  - the text of which it provided - cancelling the registration of the following organisations: the Association of Peruvian Telegraphists and Radio Telegraphists, the National Association of Postmen and Post Office Workers of Peru, the Society of Postal Employees of Peru and the Association of Postal and Telegraph Office Drivers of Peru. The preamble to this resolution recalled that under section  of Act No.  associations of workers in the public sector may not adopt the same forms of organisation and means of action as trade unions, nor may they resort to strikes or any other form of pressure in pursuit of their claims. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Act, the resolution went on to state, the associations mentioned set up a ""sole federation of postal and telecommunication workers"". Furthermore, continued the Presidential Resolution, the said associations had carried on violent agitation within the Directorate of Posts and Telegraphs, inciting the workers to paralyse a public service, which was a crime against the security of the State. For this reason the Resolution declared that the associations had lost the right to official recognition and declared them struck from the official register.
.The communication from the WCL contained allegations identical to those of the CLAT.
.In its reply, the Government stated that the situation to which the CLAT and the WCL referred concerned only the workers at the Directorate of Posts and Telegraphs and not those of the other public services in the telecommunications sector. The Government also indicated that there were no officially recognised trade union organisations within this Directorate. In accordance with section  of Act No.  of  May , workers in public bodies depending on the Central Government could organise for the purposes of cultural and sports activities or to form co-operatives or mutual aid societies. The workers of the Directorate of Posts and Telegraphs were thus organised in associations officially recognised under civil law.
.These associations, which did not enjoy the status of trade unions, had since , stated the Government, committed acts incompatible with their legal status. In  they had united to form the ""Sole Front of Telecommunication and Postal Workers"". Following a congress, they set up the ""Sole Federation of Telecommunication and Postal Workers"" in  and organised work stoppages in the public postal and telecommunications services. Thus, in June , a strike for two weeks was called without heed for the serious consequences which it would have for the community. Such acts were, stated the Government, unlawful since the associations in question were carrying on activities which were forbidden by their legal status. Furthermore, they constituted crimes involving the initiation of penal proceedings before the Court of Military Justice in accordance with section  of Legislative Decree No.  (General Telecommunications Act), which defines such work stoppages as sabotage. Nevertheless, continued the Government, the workers at the Directorate of Posts and Telegraphs implicated in these criminal acts had benefited from measures of amnesty.
.Referring more specifically to the facts mentioned by the complainants the Government confirmed that, on  June , the Sole Federation of Telecommunication and Postal Workers had submitted a statement of minimum claims. This document, stated the Government, contained claims which were incompatible with the conditions of employment of public workers of the Central Government. The Ministry of Transport and Communications therefore pronounced that the statement was not open to negotiation. In order, however, that consultation should be maintained at all levels, the Director of Posts and Telegraphs had, in a letter of ",0,1977,Peru
269,"October , informed the presidents of the associations that the claims concerning certain questions, namely the granting of fellowships, the rationalisation of work, life insurance, training and recognition of length of service, would be satisfied. The question of wages would be examined in due course within the framework of the wage policy which the Government was to establish for the public sector in the next budget.
.Between  and  December  the higher authorities of the Ministry of Transport and Communications maintained contacts and discussions with the presidents of the four associations with a view to seeking a solution, but the negotiations were blocked because of the intransigence of the workers. The senior director of the Ministry told the representatives of the organisations that economic claims were determined by the laws relating to the budget and to wages for the financial year . The Minister personally expressed this standpoint to the workers on  December .
.On  December  the Federation sent the Minister a communication giving him a -hour period in which to meet the minimum claims contained in the statement. The Minister decided to return this communication, as he considered that it was irreceivable as to its substance and impertinent as to its form. The organisations then decided to call, on  December , a strike of indeterminate duration of the workers of the Directorate of Posts and Telegraphs, with the manifest intention of causing chaos and sabotaging the measures to redress the economy. This was done in obedience to the instructions of political agitators with radical leanings. Stressing the important role of posts and telecommunications the Government stated that the majority of postal and telegraph workers were aware of their responsibilities and did not obey the call to strike. The leaders of the organisations threatened those who went to work and even assaulted them. In many cases correspondence was lost or destroyed. In these circumstances the Director at the Ministry of Transport and Communications authorised the dismissal of the guilty parties and demanded the arrest of  workers who had been identified. Subsequently the Minister of the Interior was asked to release them. Since then nobody had been held in custody on account of these events.
.Nevertheless, in view of the damage caused and the serious problems to which its conciliatory attitude had given rise, the Government adopted Presidential Resolution No. / TC/CO of  February , cancelling the registration of the associations of postal and telegraph workers for exceeding the limits of their status and functions.
.In conclusion, the Government stated that the complaint was unfounded, since the authorities at no time impeded the free exercise of trade union activities. They had confined themselves to calling a halt to the unlawful and criminal acts perpetrated by groups of workers by cancelling the registration of the associations which had distorted their aims. The Government likewise affirmed that the postal and telegraph workers had been dismissed and arrested not because of their trade union activities but by virtue of criminal acts against public order, safety and the property of other workers, and against the community as a whole.
.The Committee notes that the present case refers on the one hand to the exile of a trade union official and on the other hand to the withdrawal of registration from organisations of postal and telecommunication workers and the arrest and dismissal of union officials and workers in this sector of activity.
.The Committee notes that the Government has provided no observations as regards the exile of Mr. Julin Sierra Corrales, leader of the Federation of Peruvian Metalworkers. In general, the Committee wishes to recall the importance which it attaches to the fact that in cases of exile of trade unionists, such measures are accompanied by full legal safeguards and are not the result of legitimate trade union activities on the part of those concerned. In order to be able to reach conclusions on the substance of the matter the Committee would like to receive the comments of the Government on this allegation.
.As regards the cancellation of registration of four associations of workers in the posts and telecommunications sector the Committee notes that, according to the Government, these associations did not possess the status of trade union organisations and their activities were incompatible with their legal status as established by Act No.  of  May . The Committee has taken note of the Act in question, and in particular of section , which is worded as follows:Employees of public bodies may form associations only in the fields of culture, sports, mutual aid or co-operatives. The said associations may not adopt the title of trade union or organise themselves on the same lines as trade unions, nor may they adopt the same means of action as such bodies or resort to strikes or other means of pressure in pursuit of their claims.
.The Committee notes that under these provisions workers in public bodies are prohibited from forming trade unions. The Committee feels obliged to point out the incompatibility between these provisions of Peruvian legislation and the principle laid down in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Peru, according to which workers, without distinction whatsoever, including workers in public bodies, shall have the right to establish and join organisations of their own choosing. According to Article  of the Convention, the term ""organisation"" means any organisation of workers for furthering and defending their interests. In this connection the Committee observes that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for some years commented on the denial of trade union rights in the public service and state undertakings in Peru. It nevertheless appears that the organisations concerned in the present case were already engaging in certain activities of a trade union nature in practice. The Committee considers that legitimate trade union activities should be recognised by the law throughout the public sector in conformity with Convention No. . Finally, the Committee wishes to recall the principle set forth in Article  of the Convention, namely that workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority.
.As regards the arrest and dismissal of union officials and workers in the posts and telecommunications sector the Committee notes that these measures were taken as a result of the strike called by their organisations. Under Peruvian legislation (Legislative Decree No. , section ), any participation in an illegal strike of the public telecommunications and broadcasting services, or any incitement or appeal to participate in such strike, is held to be sabotage and is subject to military jurisdiction with a penalty of  to  years' imprisonment. In addition, the Government alleges that acts of violence were committed upon workers who refused to strike.
.The Committee has always considered that recognition of trade unions in the public service does not necessarily imply the right to strike. It has recognised that the right to strike may be restricted, or even prohibited, in the public service or in essential services where a strike might result in serious public hardship, Nevertheless, where strikes are restricted or prohibited in essential services or in the public service, adequate guarantees should be ensured to safeguard the interests of the workers thus deprived of an essential means of defending their occupational interests. Restrictions should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the parties can take part at every stage, and in which the awards are binding on both parties in all cases.
.The Committee notes that the workers who had been arrested have now been released. As regards the dismissals, the Committee wishes to point out, as it has done in several other cases, that the development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action. In the present case, the Committee feels that it would be useful if the Government were to re-examine the situation of the dismissed workers as a result of the dispute in the posts and telecommunications sector.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the exile of Mr. Julin Sierra Corrales, to request the Government to send its observations;(b) as regards the labour dispute in the posts and telecommunications sector:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above, and in particular to Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Peru, according to which workers, without distinction whatsoever, including workers in public bodies, have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing;(ii) to urge the Government to take steps to ensure recognition of the free exercise of trade union rights for all workers in the public sector;(iii) to point out that restrictions on the right to strike in the public service and in essential services should be accompanied by adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures in which the",-1,1977,Peru
270,"parties can take part at every stage, and in which the awards are binding on both parties;(c) as regards the measures of arrest and dismissal:(i) to note with interest that the persons who were arrested have now been released;(ii) to draw attention to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above, and to suggest that the Government should contemplate re-examining the situation of the dismissed workers;(d) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1977,Peru
271,"has not decreed the dissolution of any union. The temporary suspension (by administrative decision), provided for in section  of the Labour Code, of workers' organisations in the event of a strike that is declared to be illegal may last up to six months. Measures of this kind have been taken, the Government adds, but these penalties have not exceeded two months and all the unions concerned, without exception, have seen their rights fully restored to them. The Government has submitted draft legislation to Congress whereby extraordinary powers would be granted for the revision of current labour laws on this basis, the Government proposes to inform the studies Committees that will be set up of the recommendation relating to the harmonisation of national laws and regulations with Article  of Convention No. . The Government will adopt a final decision when it has heard the opinion of the workers, the employers, the legal experts and the parliamentarians on these Committees.
.The Government goes on to say that it has not been established that the provisions of Decree No.  have been applied to trade union leaders or to well-known members of their organisations. Moreover, the sentences that were imposed on the basis of this Decree to various persons for reasons connected with public order have already been served since the heaviest penalty did not exceed  days' imprisonment. There is no longer anyone in prison as a result of the events of  September .
.The Committee notes the new information communicated by the Government, and in particular its statement that no trade unionist was among those who died on  September  nor among those who were imprisoned on the basis of Decree No. ; and that in any case there is no longer anyone is prison on the basis of this Decree.
.The Committee also notes the Government's statement to the effect that the Ministry of Labour has not decreed the dissolution of any union; and that the measures of suspension have come to an end. Furthermore, the Government proposes to refer the Committee's recommendations on harmonising of its laws and regulations with Article  of Convention No. . As recalled in paragraphs  and  above, the Committee has already set out a number of principles and considerations concerning this aspect of the case. It is examining the issue again, in the present report, in connection with Cases Nos.  and , also concerning Colombia.
.As regards the dismissals which took place, the Committee notes that Decree No.  of  August  authorises the dismissal of workers for strike activities during a state of emergency. The Committee considers that this provision, which must be heeded by the courts, entails serious risks of abuse and threatens freedom of association. However, it notes that, according to the Government, there have already been a number of court rulings ordering reinstatement and that not many dismissals took place on the basis of the Decree. The Committee considers it desirable to be kept informed of developments in the situation in this respect.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Government Body:(a) to note the statements of the Government that no trade unionist was among those who died during the events of September , referred to in this case, nor among those who served prison sentences and who, incidentally, have now all been released;(b) to note the information communicated by the Government to the effect that all the trade unions whose legal status had been suspended have recovered their rights in full;(c) to note also that many of the workers who had been dismissed have been reinstated following court rulings and to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of all new developments in this respect.
.The Committee has already examined this case at its February  session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.The Government has since sent a communication dated  April .
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The present case relates essentially to the alleged death, arrest, dismissal and lay-off of large numbers of trade union officials and activists and to suspensions, withdrawals or refusals of legal personality involving several trade union organisations. According to the complainants these incidents had taken place mainly - though not entirely - as the result of a twenty-four hour general strike called on  September  by the trade union federations of the country.
.The complainants stated that in recent months there had been a series of violations of the trade union rights of workers and their organisations. This, they said, had been in response to the legitimate demands and action of workers in the face of Colombia's galloping inflation, which made it impossible to survive with wages that were among the lowest in Latin America. The situation had reached such a point, added the complainants, that all the trade union organisations of Colombia had, for the first time, decided to form a common front and to take joint action. In response the Government had adopted Presidential Decree No.  which provided for prison sentences, fines and other sanctions for union officials and activists who were involved in the organisation of strikes and other legitimate activities.
.In subsequent communications the complainants supplied a list of persons killed, imprisoned or dismissed as the result of the strike, together with the names of trade union organisations whose legal personality had been suspended or withdrawn, thus depriving them of the possibility of carrying on their activities legally.
.The Government transmitted observations in reply to certain of these allegations in a letter of October . It stated that for reasons of internal public order - which was threatened by the strike of  September  - it had found itself obliged to take certain steps, specifically in connection with Decree No.  of  August . These steps, which were of a strictly preventive nature and had been widely publicised, provided for the justifiable dismissal of persons responsible for instigating, encouraging or promoting in any way the total or partial, continuous or staggered stoppage of occupational activities. The Government emphasised that these preventive measures had been designed to counter the national strike of  September ; as had been clearly established by subsequent investigations, the strike was not of an occupational nature but was intended to disrupt public order. As a result, there had been twelve innocent victims, public disturbances and damage to vehicles and business establishments.
.When it examined the case at its February  session the Committee took note of Decree No.  adopted on  August  by the Colombian Government. Under this Decree and for the duration of the state of emergency, persons responsible for organising, leading, instigating, encouraging or promoting in any way the total or partial, continuous or staggered stoppage of normal occupational or other activities are liable to  to  days' imprisonment. The sentence can be passed by the governors, administrators and commissioners and by the mayor of the special district of Bogot, by means of a resolution specifying the grounds therefor. These sanctions, or participation in the aforementioned work stoppages, are moreover considered to be reasonable grounds for dismissal. The Government confirmed that this Decree was adopted as a preventive measure in order to counter the national strike of  September.
.Referring to the considerations which it had expressed in a recent case, the Committee pointed out that Convention No.  recognises the right of trade union organisations to formulate their programmes and organise their activities; this entails not only the right to negotiate with employers but also the right to express their point of view on economic and social questions affecting their members' interests. The Committee also stated that, in view of this right which trade unions were thus recognised as having, it has always considered that the right to strike is an essential means whereby members may promote and defend their occupational interests, but emphasised that strikes of a purely political nature do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association. As concerns claims of an economic nature, continued the Committee, the right to strike should not be restricted solely to industrial disputes likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement. The Committee considered that workers and their organisations should be allowed to express in a broader context, if they so wish, their feelings with regard to economic and social matters affecting their interests.
.While observing that the versions of the events given by the complainants and the Government were contradictory, the Committee could not but note the severity of the methods employed in response to a -hour strike which seemed to have been largely an expression of discontent by a great many workers, since it was organised by all the major tendencies of the Colombian trade union movement. The Committee felt that, if no steps were taken, the repercussions of the strike were",0,1977,Colombia
272,".The Committee has already examined this case, in February and November , and at each of these sessions it submitted the interim conclusions contained in its th and th Reports' respectively.
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The case relates essentially to the alleged death, imprisonment, lay-off or dismissal of large numbers of trade union officials and militants and to the suspension of several trade union organisations or the withdrawal or denial of their legal status. According to the complainants, these incidents have taken place mainly - though not entirely - as a result of a -hour general strike called on  September  by the trade union federations of the country.
.When examining the case, the Committee took note of Decree No.  adopted by the Colombian Government on  August . Under this Decree, and for the duration of the state of emergency, persons responsible for organising, leading, instigating, encouraging or promoting in any way the total or partial, continuous or staggered stoppage of normal occupational or other activities are liable to  to  days, imprisonment. The sentence can be passed by the governors, administrators and commissioners and by the mayor of the special district of Bogot, by means of a resolution specifying the grounds adduced therefor. These penalties or participation in the above-mentioned work stoppages are moreover considered to be reasonable grounds for dismissal. The Government confirmed that the Decree had been adopted as a preventive measure to contain the national strike of  September . While observing that the versions of the events given by the complainants and by the Government were contradictory, the Committee had noted the severity of the methods employed in response to a -hour strike which seemed to have been largely an expression of discontent by a great many workers since it was organised by all the major tendencies of the Colombian trade union movement. The Committee had considered that, if no steps were taken, the repercussions of the strike were liable to cause a lasting deterioration in industrial relations in the country.
.With regard to the deaths of trade unionists, the Government had stated that it was not for the Ministry of Labour to conduct an inquiry but that this was rather a matter for the courts. The Committee explained that it in no way sought to question the prerogatives of the judiciary, considering, on the contrary, that a regular legal procedure conducted by the competent courts would permit a fully objective and independent elucidation of the facts and determination of responsibilities.
.The Government also stated that a limited number of dismissal authorisations had been granted following the general strike of  September . The Committee observed, however, that the complainants had mentioned several hundred dismissals of workers and trade unionists and that, in particular, the ICFTU had referred to some  measures of this nature, indicating the names of the undertakings or unions concerned, in an annex to its complaint. In regard to other cases, the Committee had considered that dismissals following strikes involved serious risks of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association. It had also considered that the development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe penalties to workers who participated in strike action. In view of these considerations, the Committee had felt that it would be desirable for the Government to take measures to promote the reinstatement of the dismissed workers.
.The Government had further stated that the withdrawal of legal status was a prerogative of the ordinary labour courts. The Committee had, in fact, noted that the most severe penalty (laid down in section  of the Labour Code) that could be imposed on a trade union for contravening the provisions of the Code was the withdrawal of its legal status and the dissolution of the union; this was a measure taken by the labour courts at the request of the Ministry of Labour. Nevertheless, the Committee also noted that, in the event of a strike being declared illegal, the Ministry could decide to suspend the legal status of a union for up to six months, and even to dissolve it (section ). In these circumstances, the Committee recalled the importance of the principle laid down in Article  of Convention No.  according to which workers' and employers' organisations should not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority. For this principle to be properly complied with, moreover, it would not suffice for legislation to provide for a right of appeal against administrative decisions; it would be necessary to stipulate that such decisions could not become effective until the statutory period had expired without an appeal being lodged against them or until they had been confirmed by a court decision. It was also important that judges should be able to inquire into the substance of the matter before them.
.The Committee added that these principles were particularly important in the case of Colombia since, under section  of the Labour Code, no union could operate as such or carry out functions conferred on it by law and by its own rules or exercise, its own rights without having been granted legal status. Furthermore, the union could function only for so long as such legal status remained valid. Consequently, the suspension of the legal status of a union made it impossible for it to promote and defend the interests of its members. In the light of these considerations, the Committee felt it desirable that the Government should take the necessary steps to bring the legislation fully into conformity with the principles set forth above.
.The Government did not communicate its observations on the arrest of trade unionists. In this respect, the Committee expressed its concern regarding the summary nature of the procedure laid down in the above-mentioned Decree No. . The bringing of detained persons before the appropriate judge without delay was one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to safeguard the exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances, and on the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body decided in November :(a) as regards the deaths of trade unionists, to draw the attention of the Government to a need for complete inquiries to be made in such cases in order to elucidate the facts and determine responsibilities;(b) as regards the dismissal measures, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations recalled above and to suggest to in the desirability of taking the necessary steps to promote the reinstatement of the dismissed workers;(c) as regards the suspension of the legal status of a number of trade unions or their dissolution, to request the Government to take the necessary steps to bring the legislation fully into conformity with Article  of Convention No.  according to which organisations of workers should not be liable to be suspended by administrative authority, and to re-examine the situation of the trade unions which were dissolved on the occasion of the general strike of  September ;(d) as regards the arrests of workers and trade unionists, to express its concern at the summary nature of the procedure provided for under Decree No.  and to request the Government to provide information on the present situation of the persons arrested during the general strike of  September .
.The Government replied by letters dated  and  January . As regards the inquiries into the deaths of persons, it states that such inquiries are a matter for the legal authorities and that the Government does not have access to the documents on the case. Nevertheless, the Government continues, it is impossible to maintain, on the basis of available information, that there were trade unionists among those who died on  September : the list (which the Government has communicated) of the  persons who died that day does not include the name of any trade union leader or any member of a trade union organisation.
.The Government also states that it is not informed officially when workers are dismissed except when an administrative authorisation is required, which is seldom. Decree No. , issued on the basis of the state of emergency, provides that a justified cause for terminating the contract of employment is the application of penalties in accordance with the Decree or participation in the work stoppages referred to therein. An inquiry that was carried out (inevitably of a limited nature) indicates that not many dismissals took place. The Ministry of Labour is not empowered to order the reinstatement of workers who have been dismissed; this is a matter for the courts and the trade union organisations are awaiting rulings in the matter. The Government adds that in several cases judgements ordering reinstatement have already been handed down by different judges.
.The Government specifies that the Ministry of Labour",0,1977,Colombia

.The Committee has already examined this case at its session in May , when it submitted interim conclusions to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June ).
.Colombia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints contained allegations concerning the death of the peasants' leader Justiniano Lame and the arrest of the First Vice-Chairman of the National Agrarian Federation (FANAL); concerning the trade union rights of workers at the Colombian Social Insurance Institute (ICSS) and in the teaching profession; and concerning action taken against the works trade union of the Colombian Mineral Water Enterprise and its leaders.
.After analysing the information supplied by the complainants and by the Government, the Committee recommended the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the death of Justiniano Lame and the arrest of the First Vice-Chairman of the FANAL, to request the Government:(i) to communicate the results of the judicial inquiry into the death of the aforementioned leader;(ii) to send its observations on the allegations concerning the arrest of the FANAL leader, specifying the grounds for the arrest and indicating whether judicial proceedings had been instituted against him, and, if so, to communicate the text of the judgement given or to be given, and the reasons adduced therefor;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the trade union rights of workers at the ICSS and in the teaching profession:(i) to request the Government to communicate the results of the studies undertaken with respect to the status of the workers at the ICSS and in the teaching profession and to indicate the measures which it decided to take on the basis of these results;(ii) to request the Government to transmit its observations on the alleged dismissal of over  trade union leaders and workers of the ICSS;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the Colombian Mineral Water Enterprise:(i) to recall that, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(ii) to request the Government to communicate its observations on this aspect of the case;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Government has still not sent the observations and information requested with respect to the matters referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of the previous paragraph. By a communication dated  September , the Government, however, supplied certain information and comments with regard to the case of the workers at the Colombian Mineral Water Enterprise.
.The Committee recalls that the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries workers had stated that the enterprise in question had requested authorisation in December  to dismiss the members of the works trade union Committee. The Minister of Labour had issued a resolution declaring illegal a work stoppage which had allegedly taken place in the undertaking, blocked the union's funds, suspended the union's legal personality for three months and authorised the undertaking to dismiss the workers, including the union leaders. According to the complainants, the work stoppage in question had never taken place.
.When the Committee examined this complaint at its session in May , the Government had not yet furnished its observations on it.
.In its communication of  September , the Government stated that, as a consequence of the calling of a work stoppage without warning by the workers at the Colombian Mineral Water Enterprise, the Ministry of Labour, exercising the powers vested in it by law, had issued an administrative order declaring the stoppage to be illegal and suspending the legal personality of the union for a period of two months. The Government went on to state that this administrative sanction, motivated by a stoppage of work in the absence of any collective dispute, had been imposed at a time when Colombia was not yet bound to observe Conventions Nos.  and , which it ratified later.
.The Committee trusts that - now that Colombia has ratified Convention No.  - the Government will take the necessary steps without delay to amend the provisions of the Labour Code which allow for the suspension of a trade union by administrative authority. The Committee has already in earlier cases' drawn the attention of the Government to the generally accepted principle that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to suspension or dissolution by administrative authority, as has occurred with the works union of the Colombian Mineral water Enterprise. Measures of this kind do not in fact ensure the right of defence which normal judicial procedure alone can guarantee. In this connection the Committee feels bound to point out the contradiction between the complainants' assertion that no work stoppage had taken place and the Government's reply to the effect that the workers had stopped work even though there was no collective dispute. This contradiction further prevents the Committee from formulating its conclusions as concerns the decision the Government is said to have taken to authorise the dismissal of trade union leaders and workers.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to the Colombian Mineral Water Enterprise:(i) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph , and to urge it to take the necessary steps without delay to amend the provisions of the Labour Code which allow for the suspension of a trade union by administrative authority;(ii) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the death of Justiniano Lame and the arrest of the First Vice-Chairman of the FANAL, and the allegations relating to the trade union rights of workers at the Colombian Social Insurance Institute and in the teaching profession, to request the Government once again to provide the observations and information specified in paragraph ;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaints and the additional information pro provided by the complainants are contained in the following communications: two communications, dated  February and  March , from the National Agrarian Federation (FANAL); two communications, dated nd February and  March , from the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers; and one communication, dated  March , from the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CSTC).
.These communications were transmitted to the Government as and when they were received. The latter sent its observations in a letter of  April .
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to the death of Justiniano Lame and the arrest of the First Vice-President of FANAL, to request the Government:(i) to communicate the results of the judicial inquiry into the death of the aforementioned leader;(ii) to send its observations on the allegations concerning the arrest of the FANAL leader, specifying the grounds for the arrest and indicating whether judicial proceedings have been instituted against him and, if so, to communicate the text of the judgement given or to be given, and the reasons adduced therefor;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the trade union rights of workers in ICSS and the teaching profession:(i) to request the Government to communicate the results of the studies undertaken with respect to the status of the workers of ICSS and the teaching profession and to indicate the measures which it decides to take on the basis of these results;(ii) to request the Government to transmit its observations on the alleged dismissal of over  trade union leaders and workers of ICSS;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the Colombian Mineral Water Enterprise:(i) to recall that, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , workers"" organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority;(ii) to request the Government to communicate its observations on this aspect of the case;(d) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1977,Colombia
274,".The Committee has already examined this case, at its February and May  sessions, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. The Government has since sent information in a communication dated  August .
.The allegations still outstanding in the present case relate to incidents which occurred at the Sula dairies. According to the complainant organisation the management dismissed the members of the union's executive and contrived, in the course of a manipulated meeting, to secure the appointment of a new executive, made up of persons whom the employer had won over.
.In its communication of  August  the Government states that in November  the manager of the undertaking concerned dismissed Manuel de Jess Zepeda Lobo, Victoriano Quintanilla, Orlando Venegas C, Irene Amaya Alvarado, Hctor Alberto Portillo and Ofelia Amador Rico, all of whom were officials of the trade union of the workers of the undertaking. In the manager's opinion these persons had committed misdemeanours which constituted grounds for dismissal under the labour legislation of Honduras.
.The Ministry of Labour, which considered that these dismissals were in flagrant violation of the legislation, demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed trade union officials through the intermediary of the Under-Secretary of State and General Director of Labour. On  November , continues the Government, the manager of the undertaking agreed to reinstate the persons concerned immediately, maintaining their grade and paying them arrears of wages.
.Subsequently, in February, April and May , five of the six trade unionists who had been dismissed resigned from their jobs in the undertaking and hence from trade union office. The Government attaches to its communication copies of the letters of resignation of the persons concerned and receipts for the indemnities which they received.
.Following these resignations, elections were held in the presence of a notary for the appointment of new leaders. Two of the workers who had resigned were confirmed in their office of controller and treasurer of the union.
.The Committee notes that the allegations referred to the dismissal of trade union officials in the Sula dairy undertaking and to manoeuvres in which the management is said to have engaged in order to organise the election of a new executive.
.As regards the dismissal of the trade union officials, it appears from the information supplied by the Government that the Ministry of Labour, considering that these measures were unlawful, intervened with the management of the undertaking and caused it to reinstate the persons who had been dismissed. The Committee notes in this connection that the Honduras Labour Code contains certain provisions which prohibit the unjustified dismissal of trade union officials. In particular, under section  of the Code, it is unlawful to dismiss from his employment any worker who is a member of a managing Committee of a union, at any time from the date of his election until the end of the six months after he ceases to hold office, unless evidence is first submitted to the competent judge showing that there is lawful cause for terminating his contract of employment.
.As regards the convening of an assembly to elect a new executive, the Committee notes that this election was made necessary by the resignation from their employment in the undertaking of five of the six officials who had previously been dismissed and subsequently reinstated. Most of the texts of the letters of resignation, which the Government attaches to its observations, mention that the decision to leave the undertaking was taken voluntarily by the persons concerned. Elections were held to fill the vacancies which had arisen in the trade union executive, apparently in conformity with the normal procedure provided for under the Labour Code. Moreover, it appears that two of the former trade union officials who had resigned were confirmed in their office.
.The Committee has already examined this case at its February  Session, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, two communications have been received from the Government, one dated  January  (received on  May ) and the other dated  March .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations related, first of all, to the arrest of Pedro Antonio Brizuela, a trade union leader from San Pedro Sula, who was an active trade unionist belonging to the group of unions known as ""dissidents"" and adviser to a large number of unions in the region. He thus had connections with the Union of Workers in the National Construction Industry and the Union of Workers in the Drink and Related Industries. The complainants stated that they were convinced that the person concerned was being harassed, at the instigation of the employers, by minor officials because of his trade union views. He was charged with conspiring against the Government, which, according to the complainants, was an entirely unjustified accusation.
.The allegations also concern events that occurred in the Sula dairies: according to the complainant organisation, the management dismissed the members of the union's executive and contrived, in the course of a manipulated meeting, to secure the appointment of a new executive, made up of persons whom the employer had won over.
.No communication had been received from the Government at the time when the case was examined by the Committee at its February  session. In these circumstances, the Governing Body decided, on the recommendation of the Committee:(a) to regret that, in the absence of any reply from the Government, the Committee was unable to examine the views of the Government on this matter;(b) to draw the Government's attention to various principles and considerations with regard to the detention of trade unionists and protection against anti-trade union practices;(c) to urge the Government to communicate its observations in the near future on the various points raised in the complaint.
.In its communication of  January  received on  May  the Government states that for the purpose of investigating political movements whose activities were prejudicial to the security of the State, the trade union leader Pedro Brizuela was arrested on  October  and released a few hours later. The Government states that the arrest was motivated by purely political considerations which were unconnected with labour problems. The Government stresses that at all times Mr. Brizuela had enjoyed complete freedom to carry out his trade union activities.
.The Government attaches some press cuttings to its communication of  March , one of which concerns the arrest of Pedro Brizuela.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government, in particular the statement that the trade union leader Pedro Brizuela was released a few hours after his arrest. The Committee must, however, note that the Government attributes the arrest to political grounds without specifying the facts imputable to the person concerned. In this connection, the Committee wishes to point out that the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found is liable to involve restrictions on trade union rights, and that governments should take steps to ensure that the authorities concerned have instructions appropriate to eliminate the danger of detention for trade union activities.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not sent observations regarding the allegations relating to the dismissal of the members of the executive of the trade union of the Sula dairies and the election of a new executive. The Committee observes that the Labour Code of Honduras contains certain provisions which prohibit the unjustified dismissal of trade union leaders but it considers that it is necessary for it to have at its disposal the observations of the Government on these allegations in order to be able to examine them with full knowledge of the facts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that Pedro Brizuela was released shortly after his arrest but to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraph  above regarding the arrest of trade unionists;(b) to request the Government to send its observations regarding the allegations concerning the dismissal of the leaders of the union of the Sula dairies and the election of a new executive;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaint of the Trade Union Unity Committee of the Workers of Central America and Panama is contained in a letter of  November  which was transmitted to the Government by letter of  December  for its observations on the allegations contained therein. Despite repeated requests, the Government has sent no reply. In May , the Committee had appealed to the Government to send its observations urgently. In November , moreover, the Government was informed that, in accordance with established procedure, at its following session the Committee might submit a report on the substance of the matter even if the information awaited had still not been received.
.Since there has still been no reply from the Government, the Committee considers it necessary, before examining the allegations, to recall",0,1977,Honduras
275,".Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly,",-1,1977,El Salvador
276,"in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the",0,1977,El Salvador
277,"trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating",-1,1977,El Salvador
278,".The Committee has already examined this case, at its February  Session, when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body and requested the Government to supply certain information.
.As the Government did not send this information, despite repeated requests, the Committee decided, at its May  Session, to apply the special procedure of contacts with government representatives during the International Labour Conference. In accordance with this procedure the Chairman of the Committee met the Government delegates of Ecuador on  June  to discuss the delay in sending the replies. On this occasion the Government delegates handed the Chairman of the Committee a letter dated  June  containing observations and information on the case.
.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints presented in October and November  related in particular to incidents which occurred during a strike of workers at the Aztra Sugar Refinery Plant at La Troncal, in the province of El Caar.
.The complainants explained that the collective agreements in force in the Ecuadorian sugar industry stipulated that in the event of an increase in the selling price of this foodstuff, the workers would be entitled to a percentage of this increase in the form of an addition to their wages. In August  the cabinet decided to raise the price of sugar on the home market by more than  per cent. Subsequently, however, it was specified that this increase would not result in an increase in the workers' wages. It was in protest against this decision which, according to the complainants, infringed the provisions contained in their collective agreements, that the workers of the Aztra Refinery had occupied the plant.
.Two hundred policemen had then attacked the premises, allegedly causing the deaths of around  people and injuries to many others. Immediately following these events, trade union leaders had been arrested or prosecuted. Among them were Brunmel Reyes, refinery workers' adviser; Santiago Espinoza, President of the FETLA; Cesreo Valverde Flores, General Secretary of the Provincial Federation of the Workers of Guayas; and Julio Chang Crespo, President of the Federation of Free Workers of Guayas. At Quito, Jos Chvez, President of the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Unions, had also been arrested. The complainants also stated that these persons were being held without trial.
.In its reply of January  the Government stated that the Ministry of Labour had initiated an arbitration procedure which had ended in an agreement. Nevertheless, workers had occupied the factory the following day and informed the labour inspectorate that they had called a strike. The forces of order, who had intervened by decision of the Ministry of the Interior, had called in vain for the evacuation of the undertaking, and the instigators of the strike, armed with sticks and other weapons, had prevented more than  men from leaving. In the total confusion that resulted many workers fell into the irrigation canal surrounding the plant.
.At its February  Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee:(a) deplored the particularly grave nature of the events which had occurred;(b) drew the attention of the Government to certain considerations respecting the intervention of the forces of order;(c) requested the Government to supply information on the present position of the trade union leaders mentioned by the complainants and to indicate, in particular, which of them were still being detained and whether they had been brought before the courts.
.In its communication of  June  the Government recalls that general presidential, vice-presidential and parliamentary elections were held in full freedom on  April . It states that nobody is at present under arrest for political reasons or for reasons connected with labour disputes or a militant trade union action.
.The Government states, in particular, that the persons mentioned by the complainants, now enjoy full freedom and are not being prosecuted by the courts for any offence. One of them, Mr. Julio Chang Crespo, was a Workers' adviser in the Ecuadorian delegation to the th Session of the International Labour Conference ().
.The Committee notes that the trade union leaders arrested immediately after the incidents which had occurred at the Aztra Refinery have now been released. Nevertheless, the Government's reply does not state whether the leaders concerned were brought before the courts, nor what was the period of their detention. In this respect the Committee wishes to recall that, generally speaking, the arrest of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found, and the preventive detention of trade union leaders may involve serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that the trade union leaders mentioned by the complainants have now been released;(b) while again deploring the grave nature of the events which had occurred, and subject to the considerations and principles set forth in the previous paragraph, to decide that the case does not call for further consideration.
.On the dates shown below the following organisations forwarded communications containing allegations of infringements of trade union rights in Ecuador: the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( October and  November ), the Federation of Coastal Agricultural Workers (FTAL) ( October ), the Permanent Unitary Committee of the Workers of Guayas ( October ) and the World Federation of Trade Unions ( November ). The Government forwarded its observations in two communications, dated  January .
.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The various complaints submitted under this case relate primarily to incidents which occurred on the occasion of workers strikes at the AZTRA sugar refinery and the San Rafal farm of the VALDEZ SA sugar company.
.The complainants alleged, first, that on  October   policemen armed with firearms and tear gas bombs had surrounded the AZTRA sugar refinery plant at La Troncal in the province of El Caar where workers were on strike in accordance with the law. According to the trade union organisations this attack caused the death of around  people (workers and close relatives who were on the spot) and injuries to many others. The official number of dead acknowledged by the Government was . The people in question were drowned while attempting to cross an irrigation canal in their efforts to avoid the bullets and tear bombs. In addition, the complainants stated that many people had been killed by bullets. According to the Federation of Coastal Agricultural Workers, the exact number of deaths could not be established since, during the night,  bodies had been removed by the police and thrown into the boilers in the refinery. Furthermore, many persons had disappeared. Immediately following these events, the trade union leaders of the refinery were arrested or prosecuted. Of the persons arrested the complainants named the following: Brunmel Reyes, refinery workers' adviser, Santiago Espinoza, President of the FETLA, Cesareo Valverde Flores, General Secretary of the Provincial Federation of the Workers of Guayas (FPTG-CTE), whose life was in danger owing to the grave state of his health, and Julio Chang Crespo, President of the Federation of Free Workers of Guayas. Warrants had also been issued for the arrest of the members of the Unitary Committee of the three trade union centrals of the province. At Quito, Jos Chvez, President of the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Unions (CEOSL), had also been arrested. The Permanent Unitary Committee of Guayas stated that these persons were being held without trial.
.The ICFTU in its complaint described the events which had led up to the strike by workers of the AZTRA refinery. It explained that the collective agreements in force in the Ecuadorian sugar industry prior to  August  stipulated that in the event of an increase in the selling price of this foodstuff, the workers would be entitled to a percentage of this increase in the form of an addition to their wages. At its session on  August , the Cabinet decided to raise the price of sugar on the home market by more than  per cent. On  August a joint agreement of the Ministers of industry, Commerce, Integration, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry confirmed the Government decision, specifying that ""the difference between the current and the previous prices of sugar would not be allotted to an increase in the workers' wages"". In protest against this decision which, according to the ICFTU, infringed the provisions contained in their collective agreements, the workers of the AZTRA refinery occupied the plant in question.
.The WFTU alleged that on  October  a group of  persons assisted by the rural police had opened fire on strikers at the ""San Rafal"" farm. Six workers had been killed and a certain number of them wounded. According to a press cutting forwarded by the WFTU and communicated to the Government, the workers on this",0,1977,Ecuador
279,"the complaints. According to it, the Government of the Revolutionary Junta of El Salvador, since its installation on  October , has adopted a policy entirely different from that of earlier regimes, a policy of absolute respect for human rights, including freedom of association; it accepts no responsibility for any violations which may have occurred in the past.
.The Committee notes the statement made in December  by the new Government that it will follow a policy of respect for human rights, including the aspects relating to freedom of association. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that a general statement of this nature does not provide the elements of information necessary for the elucidation of the present cases, since they are part of a well-defined series of circumstances and situations the examination of which requires it to be in possession of the information which the Governing Body has requested of the Government on repeated occasions.
.The Committee recalls that on earlier occasions, when examining allegations relating to the violation of trade union rights by a government, it has emphasised that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. In this sense, the Committee has taken the view that, where a change of regime has taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor might have had since its accession to power.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statement made in December  of the new Government that it has adopted a policy of respect for human rights, including aspects relating to freedom of association;(b) to request the Government to send:(i) information in connection with paragraphs  and  of the present report, respecting the proceedings against Mr. Francisco Girn Ramos, the present situation of the various trade unionists listed in the annex to this case, the accusations of torture and persecution of trade unionists and trade union organisations, the stage reached in the proceedings in connection with the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, and the incidents which occurred during a strike of workers of the El Len factory;(ii) its observations on the new allegations referred to in paragraphs , ,  and  of the present report, relating to the murder of the workers, trade union officials and primary-school teachers mentioned in the annex to this case, to the repression of workers and trade unions which demanded collective labour agreements, and to the situation of  workers of the IMES undertaking;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee already examined this case at its session in November , when it presented interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report in November  (th Session).
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), nor the Rural Workers' Organisations Convention,  (No. ).
.The WCL alleged that because of repression by the Salvadorian Government, action by the El Salvador Peasants' Central Union (CCS) in defence of rural workers was becoming increasingly difficult. The complainants added that militants of the organisation had been accused of illegal occupation of land and arrested on  October ; they were being held in the prison of Ilobasco, Cabaas Department. The persons concerned were Gilberto Echeverra Mndez, Julin Pilr Echeverra, Dolores Amadeo Rivas, Jose Santos Aguilar and Alejandro Apolonio Mndez. The WCL stated that the land in question belonged to the CEL autonomous company and not to the two landowners (Gamaliel Menjivar and Elias de Jests Rivas) who had denounced the militants. The complainants saw this as proof that violence had become institutionalised in El Salvador, since persons who did not own the land in question had succeeded, by means of forged documents and false witnesses, in having prison sentences passed on the peasants by the judges.
.The allegations still outstanding also related to the imprisonment of a peasant militant, Francisco Girn Ramos, who according to the WCL had been detained since  January  in the Santa Tecla prison, Department of La Libertad, on charges of slandering the authorities of Rosario de Mora; according to the complainants this accusation was designed to divert attention from the real activities of the person concerned in the field of peasants' trade unionism.
.In its reply the Government explained, as regards the persons accused of illegal occupation of land, that Mr. Elias de Jests Rivas Pea had lodged a complaint on  September  with the judge of first instance of Ilobasco, on the grounds that the persons in question had forced their way on to his property without authorisation, had taken possession of land and had prevented him from exploiting it. They had also destroyed the fences separating Mr. Rivas Pena's property from that of Mr. Jose Antonio Menjivar. According to the Government Mr. Rivas Pea had produced his title deeds before the court. Various witnesses had confirmed that the accused had used violence to gain access to the land and had begun to work on it. The examining magistrate had checked that the illegally occupied land was part of the plaintiff's property, and on  October  the judge of first instance, considering that there was sufficient proof, had ordered the arrest of the persons concerned and decided to bring the case before a court.
.The Government further indicated that Francisco Girn Ramos had been arrested on  January  for being drunk and disorderly, and had been held in the Rosario de Mora municipal prison. According to a witness, he had destroyed identity documents and official gazettes in the town hall. The justice of the peace, continued the Government, had ordered him to be placed under temporary arrest. This measure was confirmed by the penal judge and Mr. Ramos was placed under preventive detention at the Nueva San Salvador prison. He was subsequently released on bail on  March . The proceedings were continuing.
.The Government pointed out that the cases before the Committee had been the subject of judicial investigation; in the course of the trials, neither the accused nor their counsel had alleged that violations of human rights and freedom of association had been committed. The Government added that the El Salvador Peasants' Central Union was not an occupational association organised in conformity with the provisions of the Labour Code, nor had it applied to the authorities for recognition as a special association, as provided for under the civil Code.
.The Committee noted, in November , that in order to enable it to come to a decision on the substance of the case, and in particular to determine whether the proceedings instituted had a bearing on the exercise of trade union rights, it would be most useful for it to have at its disposal the texts of judgements rendered. On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body requested the Government to provide these judgements.
.In a letter of  February  the Government states that the proceedings instituted against Francisco Girn Ramos for destruction of original documents are still in progress and that the judgement will be communicated in due course. The Committee takes note of this information.
.The Government also sends a copy of the judgements rendered in respect of the other persons mentioned, from which it transpires that the acts complained of - illegal occupation of land by violent means and damage to the property of Elias de Jests Rivas Pea - occurred on  September . The accused, who had already been freed on bail, were acquitted on  June  by a judgement of a court of first instance; the judgement was upheld following an appeal. The decision became final on expiry of the time limit for lodging an appeal against it.
.The Committee is aware that agricultural workers' unions are confronted with special difficulties in many countries. The International Labour Conference has recently examined problems of rural workers' unions and their role in economic and social development, and adopted a Convention and a Recommendation on the subject in . According to Article  of this Convention, it shall be an objective of national policy concerning rural development to facilitate the establishment and growth, on a voluntary basis, of strong and independent organisations of rural workers as an effective means of ensuring the participation of rural workers, without discrimination, in economic and social development and in the benefits resulting therefore. Paragraph  of the Recommendation adds that such organisations should, as appropriate, be able to involve the various categories of rural workers, according to the interests of each, at all stages of implementation of programmes of agrarian reform, land settlement",1,1977,El Salvador
280,"and land development.
.The Committee has already considered on earlier occasions cases relating in particular to peasants who had occupied land to which they claimed a right, and in such cases it has always considered that the questions raised related to land ownership and tenure governed by specific national legislation having nothing to do with the problems of freedom of association.
.In the present case the Committee notes that the five peasant militants mentioned by the complainants have been released. These persons, as is clear from the texts of the judgements communicated by the Government, were accused of illegal occupation of land by violent means and damage to property. The Committee accordingly considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances it recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest the release of the five peasant militants mentioned by the complainant and to decide, for the reasons set forth in the previous paragraph, that this aspect of the case calls for no further examination;(b) to request the Government to communicate, as already promised, the text of the judgement rendered in the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.In a communication dated  March , the world Confederation of Labour presented a complaint concerning the alleged violation of trade union rights in El Salvador. The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which sent its observations in a communication of  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication, which was also written on behalf of the world Federation of Agricultural Workers (WFAW-CMT), the world Confederation of Labour alleged that one of the main targets for repression by the Salvadorian Government was the El Salvador Peasants' Central Union (CCS), whose function of defending the workers' rural sector was, according to the complainants, becoming increasingly difficult.
.The WCL continued by stating that militants of CCS had been arrested on  October  and were now being held in the prison of Ilobasco, Cabaas Department. The persons concerned were Gilberto Echeverra Mndez, Julin Pilar Echeverra, Dolores Amadeo Rivas, Jos Santos Aguilar and Alejandro Apolonio Mndez. According to the WCL these persons had been accused of illegal occupation of land. The WCL stated that the land in question belonged to the CEL autonomous company and not to the persons who denounced these militants, namely Gamaliel Menjivar and Elias de Jests Rivas, both of whom were landowners. The WCL saw this as proof that violence has become institutionalised in El Salvador, since persons who did not own the land in question had succeeded, by means of forged documents and false witnesses, in having prison sentences passed on the peasants by the judges.
.The WCL added that two peasant militants, Francisco Girn Ramos and Germn Ortiz, had been detained since  January  in the Santa Tecla Prison, Department of La Libertad, on charges of slandering the authorities of Rosario de Mora. According to the complainants this accusation was designed to divert attention from the real activities of these two militants in the field of peasants' trade unionism.
.In its reply the Government explained, as regards the persons accused of illegal occupation of land, that Mr. Elias de Jess Riva Pena had lodged a complaint on  September  with the judge of first instance of Ilobasco. The grounds for the charge were that the persons in question had forced their way onto the property of Mr. Elas de Jests Riva Pea without authorisation and had taken possession of land in such a way as to prevent him from exploiting his property. They had also destroyed the fences separating Mr. Riva Pea's property from that of Mr. Jos Antonio Menjivar. Mr. Riva Pea produced his title deeds before the court. Various witnesses confirmed that the persons mentioned had used violence to gain access to the land and had begun to work on it.
.The examining magistrate had checked that the illegally occupied land was part of the plaintiff's property, and on  October  the judge of first instance, considering that there was sufficient proof, ordered the arrest of the persons concerned and decided to bring the case before the courts. The trial proceedings are at this stage.
.As regards Mr. Francisco Girn Ramos, the Government stated that this person had been arrested on  January  for being drunk and disorderly, and had been held in the Rosario de Mora municipal prison. A witness had stated that the person concerned had destroyed identity documents and official gazettes in the town hall, and the justice of the peace had ordered Mr. Francisco Girn Ramos to be placed under temporary arrest. This measure was confirmed by the penal judge, and Mr. Ramos was placed under preventive detention at the Nueva San Salvador prison. He was subsequently released on bail on  March . The proceedings are continuing until a final decision has been taken.
.In connection with Mr. German Cruz Ortiz, the Government stated that the local commanding officer of Rosario de Mora brought this person before the justice of the peace on  February  for insulting behaviour to the authorities in command of a military convoy. After hearing witnesses, the justice of the peace ordered Mr. Cruz to be placed in temporary custody. On  February  the judge of the criminal court ordered his release for lack of evidence. Mr. German Cruz Ortiz was immediately released.
.In conclusion, the Government pointed out that the cases before the Committee had been the subject of judicial investigation. It added that, in the course of the trials, neither the accused nor their counsel had alleged that violations of human rights and freedom of association had been committed. Finally, the Government observed that the El Salvador Peasants' Central Union was not an occupational association organised in conformity with the provisions of the Labour Code, nor had it applied to the Government for recognition as a special association, as provided for under the Civil Code.
.The Committee notes that the complaint concerns measures of arrest taken against peasants who were supposedly members of a peasant organisation which according to the Government is not an association within the terms of the Labour Code or the civil code. The Committee also notes that the persons in question were accused of illegal occupation of land, drunken and disorderly behaviour, or insulting the authorities. The Committee observes that the persons mentioned by the complainants are being tried before the courts, with the exception of one whose trial did not proceed for lack of evidence. The Committee feels that, in order to enable it to come to a decision on the substance of the case, and in particular to determine whether the proceedings instituted have a bearing on the exercise of trade union rights, it would be most useful for it to have at its disposal the texts of the judgements rendered.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest that Mr. German Cruz Ortiz, one of the persons mentioned by the complainants, has been released;(b) to request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements rendered in respect of the other persons mentioned by the complainants as soon as these are available;(c) to take note of the present interim report.",-1,1977,El Salvador
281,"the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.
.Cases Nos.  and  were examined by the Committee in May and November , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Case No.  was examined by the Committee in November  and May , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since it last examined these cases the Committee has received communications from the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur porkers ( October ), the Latin American Central of Workers ( April  and  August ) and the World Confederation of Labour ( September ). The Government sent two communications dated  and  December .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining - Convention,  (No. ).
.Case No.  concerns various allegations, one of which refers to incidents which occurred on  October  during a strike at the El Len factory, when workers were attacked by the police and two of them lost their lives. Other allegations relate to the arrest and torture of  workers of the undertaking Quality food de Centro Amrica and the arrest of  workers and disappearance of two trade union officials during an attack on the offices of two trade unions. According to the complainants all these situations fitted into the general pattern since the passage of an ""anti-terrorist Act"" designed to legalise the repression of the workers.
.Case No.  referred to the imprisonment of a peasant militant, Francisco Girn Ramos, who had been charged with slandering the authorities of Rosario de Mora. According to the complainants the real reason for this arrest lay in the trade union activities of Mr. Girn.
.In Case No.  the complainants alleged that the Government had launched a bloodthirsty campaign of persecution against agricultural workers and their organisations, resulting in many deaths, injuries and arrests.
.In connection with the above allegations the Government stated that various self-styled trade union groups were operating unlawfully, propagating anarchist and anti-democratic doctrines prohibited by the Political Constitution, and committing criminal acts. It was members of these groups, continues the Government, who killed Mr. Trnsito Vsquez. The Government professed its respect for freedom, but said that breaches of the law had occurred and that they would be punished by the competent authorities. In connection with the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, the Government said that his release had been ordered and that proceedings had been instituted against him for the destruction of original documents; the text of the judgement would be communicated once it had been handed down.
.At its May-June  Session, in connection with Case No. , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to communicate the text of the judgement rendered in the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.At its November  Session, in connection with cases Nos.  and , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to send its observations on the situation of various trade unionists named in an annex, and on the other aspects of the case referred to in paragraphs  to  and  of the Committee's th Report, and to communicate the judgement to be pronounced in the case concerning the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, with the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee has so far not received the information requested.
.In a letter of  October  the Trades Onion International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers alleges that Jos Guillermo Rivas Gonzlez, General Secretary of the Union of workers in the Cotton, Kenaf, Synthetic Fibre and Allied Textile Industries of El Salvador, was murdered on  September , and that Miguel Angel Solis and Orlando Platero, officials of the Union of Textile Industry Workers, were murdered on  September ; the reason for these alleged murders is said to be the trade union activity of the victims it is also alleged that other trade union officials have been imprisoned.
.By a telegram of  April  the Latin American Central of porkers alleges that the workers of the unions of the national undertakings La Peca, La Constancia, Embotelladora Tropical and STECEL were harshly repressed by the Government because they had demanded collective labour contracts; as a result, seven leaders and militants of these unions have been killed and a number injured.
.By letter of  August  the Latin American Central of workers sends a list of  primary-school teachers allegedly murdered with ""the undisguised complicity of the educational authorities of the country"". In addition to mentioning the full names of the teachers, the list indicates their trade union activities or their relationship with the trade union organisations, their place of work, and the date, place and circumstances of their deaths. In the same letter CLAT repeats the need for the urgent dispatch of a special mission to investigate the situation complained of.
.By a communication of  September  the world Confederation of Labour alleges that some  workers of the IMES undertaking (Industrial Manufactureras, S.A.) in the Republic of El Salvador have been deprived of their work for over three months, and that the undertaking has failed to fulfil its legal and contractual obligations; WCL requests that this document should be attached to the complaints against the Government of El Salvador for systematic violation of labour and trade union rights and ""that the authorities should be asked to take the necessary measures to secure respect for the rights of the workers in order to defend them against the manoeuvres of the foreign firm"".
.By letters of  and  December  the Government has replied to the international Labour office in connection with",0,1977,El Salvador
282,".In communications dated, respectively,  August,  September and  October , the World Confederation of Labour, the Latin American Central of Workers and the International Federation of Employees in Public service presented a complaint concerning alleged infringement of the exercise of trade union rights in Ecuador. The Government forwarded its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Ecuador has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants alleged that in pursuance of a resolution of the Ministry of Public Works, dated  July , the general management of the Ecuadorian Telecommunications Institute had dismissed  leaders of the National Federation of Telecommunications Workers of Ecuador (FENETEL), including Jacinto Padilla, President of the Pichincha Association and Gustavo Moncayo Castro, General Secretary of the Guayas Association. According to the CLAT, these steps had been taken as the result of the general strike on  May . However, according to the CLAT, the FENETEL neither called nor participated in a strike.
.The considerable volume of documentation forwarded by the CLAT relating to this case also revealed that in the month of March  the FENETEL had submitted a statement of demands to the management of the Ecuadorian Telecommunications Institute. Some of the demands included in the statement had been submitted to the management more than two years previously. No response was made by the general management which furthermore called a halt to the dialogue with the workers' representatives. The National Council of the FENETEL then decided to ask the Government openly to terminate the general manager's term of office. Shortly thereafter, the national leaders of the FENETEL were transferred to different parts of the country with a view, according to them, to depriving the federation of its leadership. The leaders affected by this action complied with the management's orders. Nevertheless, some days later they received notification-of their dismissal.
.In its reply the Government stated that the FENETEL decided on its own initiative to support the national strike of  May  organised by the three trade union Confederations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL. According to the Government, this decision was contrary to the principles governing relations between the State and its employees and was designed not only to instigate strike action but also to create a state of chaos. The Government stated that the legislation respecting the public service prohibited strike action by public servants in order that national life might not be brought to a standstill. This legislation applied to the employees of the Ecuadorian Telecommunications Institute since they were state employees.
.In examining the documents made available to it and, in particular, the press cuttings and releases relating to this case, which were communicated by the parties, the Committee notes that the resolution of the Ministry of Public Works, in pursuance of which the dismissals were carried out, refers to the preparations made by the FENETEL a short time previously for an illegal strike aimed at obtaining satisfaction of their occupational demands. This resolution also mentions the participation of the FENETEL in the general strike of  May . It would appear, therefore, that the grounds for the dismissals were, in particular, the preparations made for a strike affecting only the Ecuadorian Telecommunications Institute, on the one hand, and participation in the -hour general strike called by the national Confederations, on the other. The participation of the FENETEL in the general strike seems to be established. Indeed, it can be seen from a perusal of various newspaper articles' that the National Council of the FENETEL had decided to support the strike in question. On the other hand, the FENETEL denies having organised a specific work stoppage such as is mentioned in the dismissal resolution. It states that, aware of its responsibilities as part of a public service which is essential for the development of the nation, it did not call a national strike.
.As concerns the participation of the FENETEL in the general strike of  May , the Committee would recall that it has already examined a case relating to this strike at its session in November . On that occasion it considered that workers and their organisations should be allowed to express any dissatisfaction they may feel as concerns economic and social matters affecting their interests, so long as such action consists merely in the expression of a protest and is not intended as a breach of the peace. In the case in question, there was a -hour strike. The Committee observes, in addition, that the dismissals were carried out more than two months after the FENETEL had participated in that strike.
.As regards the preparation made by the FENETEL for a strike of workers at the Ecuadorian Telecommunications Institute, the Committee believes it can deduce from the available information that the strike was not in fact called. It also notes that the FENETEL had submitted statements of demands to the management of the Institute a considerable length of time before that, without ever receiving a precise reply relating to these demands.
.In view of the considerations expressed above, the Committee feels that it would be desirable if the Government would reconsider the situation as regards the dismissed trade union leaders with a view to their reinstatement. Action of this nature would also be conducive to the development of good industrial relations within the undertaking concerned.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to suggest to the Government that it reconsider the situation as regards the dismissed leaders of the FENETEL with a view to their reinstatement.",0,1977,Ecuador
283,".The Committee already examined this case in November  and in May . At these sessions, the Committee submitted interim conclusions in its nd Report (paragraphs  to ) and st Report (paragraphs  to ), respectively. The Governing Body approved the first report in November  (th Session) and the second in June  (th Session).
.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.This case is mainly concerned with a -hour general strike called on  May  by the three Ecuadorian trade union Confederations - the Confederation of Workers of Ecuador (CTE), the Ecuadorian Confederation of Catholic Workers (CEDOC) and the Ecuadorian Confederation of Free Trade Union Organisations (CEOSL) - and another strike organised on the same day by the National Union of Educators (UNE). Under an emergency procedure, these work stoppages led to the sentencing to fines and imprisonment of trade union officials, including Juan Vasquez Bastidas, President of the CTE, and Manuel Antn, President of the UNE, to the outlawing of the UNE and to the dismissal of a very large number of teachers. The complainants also referred to the arrest of Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guayas.
.The Committee had noted that a number of the demands made in connection with the strike of  May  were clearly occupational in character while others were not. As concerns the teachers, the Government explained that the UNE's membership embraced a substantial proportion of the teachers in the country's public education system. These teachers had decided to call a national work stoppage with a view to obtaining certain pecuniary advantages which the Government was not in a position to offer them. Nevertheless, continued the Government, the authorities had studied these demands in a desire to satisfy them as far as possible. Notwithstanding this, on the initiative of a few of its leaders, the UNE had launched itself into a national strike which had brought public schools and colleges throughout the country to a standstill for  days with the sole aim o?creating chaos, disrupting public order and attempting to shatter the peace and tranquillity of the Ecuadorian people. The Government had accordingly declared these events to be unlawful. The teaching profession is in fact governed by the Advancement and Wages Act, which enumerates the rights and duties which bind teachers to the State and prohibits strikes, work stoppages and other demonstrations of a political nature.
.The Government added that, in pursuance of Legislative Decree No.  of  June , it had punished the ringleaders by dismissing them or transferring them to other provinces. However, it had immediately quashed these sanctions and reinstated  per cent of the teachers in their profession, in some cases in the same post. The competent authorities were moreover examining the cases of the remainder with a view to their reinstatement.
.In June , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, noted the information supplied by the Government. It, however, drew the latter's attention to a certain number of considerations and principles. For example, the recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. The Committee has admitted that this right may be restricted or even prohibited in the civil service. However, such measures should be accompanied by adequate procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes and, in the final instance, by arbitration procedures in which the awards are binding in all cases upon both parties and are promptly and fully implemented. Moreover, the outlawing of the UNE in pursuance of a decree was in flagrant breach of Article  of Convention No. , which had been ratified by Ecuador. Dissolution by the executive branch Of the Government pursuant to a law conferring full powers or in the exercise of legislative functions, like dissolution by virtue of administrative powers, does not afford the right of defence and does not offer the necessary guarantees. In other words, trade unions should enjoy the protection of a normal judicial procedure where the national legislation provides for the dissolution (or suspension) of a trade union as a punishment for a serious breach of the law. Furthermore, the outlawing of the UNE was liable to deprive teachers in the public education sector of any representative organisation, since its membership embraced a substantial proportion of the teachers concerned. The Governing Body requested the Government to reconsider the measure taken against the UNE and to supply information on any development in this connection.
.Juan Vasquez Bastidas, President of the CTE, and Manuel Antn, President of the UNE, had, according to the complainants, been sentenced to two years' imprisonment and to fines of from , to , sucres, in pursuance of the aforementioned Legislative Decree No.  and Presidential Decree No.  of  May . The first of these decrees punishes very severely and in very broad terms collective stoppages of work. The Committee expressed the opinion that it should be reviewed. The second, adopted only a few days after the strike of  May , entrusts senior police officers with the responsibility of trying offenders; the sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which it refers apply in principle to minor breaches of the law; they provide for an expeditious procedure with no possibility of appeal. The Committee expressed the view that this summary procedure lent itself to abuse and that all arrested trade unionists should be subject to normal judicial procedure guaranteeing the rights of defence and conforming to the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As to Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guayas, the Government had supplied no further information.
.In June , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, suggested to the Government that it reconsider the position of Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Antn and requested it once more to indicate the present position of Julio Ayala Serra.
.In a letter dated  September , the Government refers to Manual Antn and Julio Ayala Serra who, it states, were sentenced by special judges, in pursuance of Decrees Nos.  and , for having attempted to undermine the legally constituted Government, disrupted public order and provoked a number of incidents. Nevertheless, adds the Government, aware of the country's need for peace and tranquillity, it has accepted the request of several groups and of the ILO and a supreme decree has been issued ordering the release of the persons referred to. It emphasises that, at present, there is no further dispute relating to the complaints submitted. While considering the matter closed as far as it is concerned, the Government states that it is prepared to answer any questions the Committee may wish to ask.
.The Committee takes note with interest of the release of the persons referred to. Nevertheless, the Government has not provided any additional information on the present situation of the President of the CTE, Juan. Vasquez Bastidas, or on the UNE, which had been dissolved by decree.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note with interest the release of Manuel Antn and Julio Ayala Serra;(b) to suggest again to the Government that it reconsider the position of Juan Vasquez Bastidas;(c) to urge the Government to reconsider the measure of dissolution by administrative means taken against the UNE, which is in flagrant breach of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Ecuador, as stated in paragraph  above; and(d) to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of the measures taken with regard to the matters raised in (b) and (c) above.
.The Committee has already examined, in November , the complaints presented by the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), and the Government's observations in reply to these complaints. The International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions (IFFTU) had also presented a complaint by a letter dated  October . At that session the Committee submitted interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its nd Report. The Governing Body approved this report in November  also (th Session). A further complaint has been received from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU - communication of  November ). The Government has supplied further observations by letters dated  March  and  April .
.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.This case is mainly concerned with a -hour general strike called on  May  by the three Ecuadorian trade union Confederations - the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL - and another strike organised on the same day by the National Union of Educators (UNE). These work stoppages",0,1977,Ecuador
284,"led to the sentencing, under an emergency procedure, to fines and imprisonment of trade union officials including Juan Vasquez Bastidas, President of the CTE, and Manuel Anton, President of the UNE. The World Federation of Trade Unions also referred to the arrest of Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guays, and the outlawing of the UNE, but the Government had made no observations on the latter two points.
.The Committee noted that a number of the demands made in connection with the strike of  May  were clearly occupational in character, while others were not. As concerns the claims of an economic nature, the Committee pointed out that the right to strike should not be restricted solely to industrial disputes likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement; workers and their organisations should be allowed to express in a broader context, if they so wished, any dissatisfaction they might feel as concerns economic and social matters affecting their members' interests, so long as such action consisted merely in the expression of a protest and was not intended as a breach of the peace.
.Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton had been given heavy sentences - two years' imprisonment and fines of from , to , sucres, according to the complainants - as a result of the strike of  May , in pursuance of Legislative Decree No.  of  June  and Presidential Decree No.  of  May . The first of these decrees punishes severely and in very broad terms collective stoppages of work. The Committee expressed the opinion that it should be reviewed. The second, adopted only a few days after the strike in question, entrusts senior police officers with the responsibility of trying offenders; the sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which it refers apply in principle to minor breaches of the law; they provide for an expeditious procedure with no possibility of appeal. The Committee expressed the view that this summary procedure lent itself to abuse, and that all arrested trade unionists should be subject to normal judicial procedure guaranteeing the rights of defence and conforming to the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
.In these circumstances, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to review Legislative Decree No.  and to consider the repeal of Presidential Decree No. , and requested the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to follow developments in this connection. The Governing Body also suggested to the Government the possibility of reconsidering the position of Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton. It requested the Government to indicate the present position of Julio Ayala Serra and to forward its observations with respect to the outlawing of the UNE.
.The International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions (IFFTU) also referred in its letter of  October  to the industrial action taken by teachers with a view to obtaining a pay increase. It alleged that the Government had immediately reacted by applying Decrees Nos.  and , with the result that the UNE was dissolved and its national and regional leaders were jailed. They were sentenced to fines of from , to , sucres ( to  United States dollars) and struck off the register of teachers forthwith, along with  of their colleagues. In a letter dated  November , primarily concerned with another aspect of the trade union situation in Ecuador, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions mentioned these two decrees, which had, inter alia, resulted in the outlawing of the UNE (Decree No. ) and facilitated individual and ,collective dismissals, and the threatening, arrest or even murder of trade unionists.
.The Government explains, in its two communications, that the UNE's membership embraces a substantial proportion of the teachers in the country's public educational system. Contrary to the most elementary principles governing relations between the State and its servants, these teachers decided to call a national work stoppage with a view to obtaining certain pecuniary advantages which the Government was not in a position to offer them. Nevertheless, continues the Government, the authorities studied these demands in a desire to satisfy them as far as possible. Notwithstanding this, on the initiative of a few of its leaders, the UNE launched itself into a national strike which brought public schools and colleges throughout the country to a standstill for  days with the sole aim of creating chaos, disrupting public order and attempting to shatter the peace and tranquillity of the Ecuadorian people.
.This strike was qualified as illegal, adds the Government, by dozens of their fellow teachers who did not share the views of the majority. Moreover, the authorities reached the conclusion after several meetings with the leaders that this was merely a campaign to enlist sympathy for a few teachers who were bad servants of the State. The Government, accordingly, declares these events to be unlawful and tendentious under the terms of the law. The teaching profession is in fact governed by the Advancement and Wages Act, which enumerates the rights and duties which bind teachers to the State and prohibits strikes, work stoppages and other demonstrations of a political nature. Teachers are public servants and may not infringe the provisions of the law. They are protected by laws which are different from the national labour legislation. Consequently, the Government does not consider that it has infringed Conventions Nos.  and , which apply to workers covered by the Labour Code and not to public servants, such as teachers, who have a public and social function to perform - in this instance, the education of the country's children and adolescents. The Government adds that in pursuance of the aforementioned Legislative Decree No. , it punished the ringleaders by dismissing them or transferring them to other provinces. However, it immediately quashed these sanctions and reinstated  per cent of the teachers in their profession, in some cases in the same post. The competent authorities are examining the cases of the remainder with a view to their reinstatement.
.The Committee notes this information, and in particular that concerning the reinstatement of teachers in their profession. It wishes, first of all, to recall that the standards on freedom of association embodied in Convention No.  apply to all workers, ""without distinction whatsoever"", and are therefore applicable to employees of the 'State. It was indeed considered inequitable to draw any distinction in trade union matters between workers in the private sector and public servants, since persons in either category should be permitted to become organised for the defence of their interests.
.Nevertheless, as was made clear during the preparatory work on Convention No. , the recognition of the right of association of public servants in no way prejudges the question of the right of such officials to strike. The Committee has admitted that this right could be restricted or even prohibited in the civil service. However, as the Committee has pointed out in a number of cases involving teachers in the public educational system, such measures should be accompanied by adequate procedures for the peaceful settlement of disputes and, in the final instance, arbitration procedures in which the awards would be binding in all cases upon both parties and would be promptly and fully implemented.
.Following this strike, the Government outlawed the UNE in pursuance of a decree, which was tantamount to dissolving this organisation. In this connection, Article  of Convention No.  provides that workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved (or suspended) by administrative authority. The Committee has often pointed out that dissolution by the executive branch of the Government pursuant to a law conferring full powers or in the exercise of legislative functions, like dissolution by virtue of administrative powers, does not afford the right of defence and does not offer the necessary guarantees. In other words, trade unions should enjoy the protection of a normal judicial procedure where the national legislation provides for the dissolution (or suspension) of a trade union as a punishment for a serious breach of the law.
.The Committee recalls that in an earlier case relating Ecuador the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, inter alia drew the Government's attention to the aforementioned principle embodied in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Ecuador, and urged that full effect be given to it. In the present case, there is also a risk that the outlawing of the UNE will deprive teachers in the public educational sector of any representative organisation, since, in the Government's own words, its membership embraces a substantial proportion of the teachers concerned.
.The Government has supplied no further information with respect to Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas, Manuel Anton and Julio Ayala Serra.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the information supplied by the Government concerning the reinstatement of the teachers dismissed for going on strike;(b) to suggest again to the Government that it reconsider the position",0,1977,Ecuador
285,"of Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton, and to request it once more to indicate the present position of Mr. Julio Ayala Serra;(c) to draw attention to the considerations and principles set forth in paragraphs  to  with respect to strikes in the teaching profession and the dissolution of the National Union of Educators (UNE), and to request the Government to reconsider the measure taken against the UNE, which is not in conformity with Article  of Convention No.  (ratified by Ecuador), and supply information on any development in this connection;(d) to take note of this interim report.
.The complaints are contained in two communications, one from the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), dated  July , and the other from the World Federation of Trade Unions, dated  July . The CPUSTAL supplied additional information in a letter dated  August . The Government forwarded its observations by a communication dated  September . On  October  the International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions submitted a complaint concerning which the Government has not yet transmitted its observations.
.Ecuador has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The CPUSTAL alleged that the Police Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of non-existent laws, had pronounced judgement sentencing to two years' imprisonment, and fines of from , to , sucres, the President of the Confederation of Workers of Ecuador (CTE), Juan Vasquez Bastidas, and the President of the National Union of Educators (UNE), Manuel Anton. These organisations are members of the CPUSTAL. The complainants added that these persons had not been given any sort of trial.
.The WFTU stated that the three Ecuadorian trade union Confederations - the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL - had organised, on  May , a -hour national strike in support of a claim for higher wages and other demands of an economic and social nature. The UNE, which has a membership of , teachers, called a work stoppage on the same day with a view to obtaining a salary rise and an increase in the national education budget. In response, added the WFTU, the Government issued a decree, No. , conferring upon police intendants the status of special judges competent to try trade union officials and strikers under an expeditious procedure with no right of appeal. At the same time the Government instructed these police intendants to bring to trial the principal leaders of the three Confederations that had organised the national strike of  May, as well as officials of the UNE.
.Furthermore, continued the complainants, the Supreme Council of Government issued on  May  a decree outlawing the UNE and providing for the custodianship of its funds. At the end of June, the General Intendant for the province of Guays, in pursuance of the aforementioned Decree No. , sentenced Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton to fines and imprisonment. The WFTU further mentioned the arrest of Julio Ayala Serra, President of the Educators' Union for the province of Guays who was to be tried under the same procedure.
.The Government, in a detailed reply to which were appended a large number of documents, emphasised that it was its policy to encourage the trade union movement in Ecuador. As evidence of this it pointed to the subsidy of , sucres that it paid to the country's trade union Confederations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, to cover the expenses of the  May rally. However, it continued, the leaders of these three Confederations had taken advantage of the opportunity afforded by this event - in which the majority of the participants had no connection with the trade union movement - to incite the workers to take part in a national work stoppage on  May , based on a combat manifesto of nine points, not all of which related to industrial matters, and which were refuted one by one. Moreover, none of these demands had been put to the competent authorities through the proper legal channels.
.In the appendices to the Government's reply there was a list of these points and the arguments whereby the Government refuted them. These demands were as follows:
.The Government stated that the union leaders were allowed to prepare for the work stoppage in full freedom. They had access to the radio, television and the press at the national level. The Government further pointed out that it had recognised the workers' organisations without reservations. However, it could not fail in its moral and legal duty to preserve public order and ensure that citizens could live their lives normally in every respect. It could only condemn incitement to disorderly conduct and anarchy, whoever was responsible, and any attempt to undermine the functioning of the State by disregarding the procedures in force for dealing with all grievances, individual or collective. In substance, the Government enforced the regulations in force to defend its stability and ensure the preservation of public order and the safety of persons and property. It was these duties that the Government was performing in dealing with the events of  May .
.The Government refuted the complainants' allegations completely. It claimed that these complaints were unfounded and did not mention a single specific case of infringement of the freedom of association Conventions. All persons living on the territory of a State, added the Government, were required to observe the laws of that country. Under Legislative Decree No.  of  June , the instigators of a collective stoppage of work, and the ringleaders of such a stoppage, were liable to a fine of from , to , sucres and from two to five years' imprisonment. Persons who participated in such a work stoppage without having instigated it or being a ringleader were liable to a fine of from  to , sucres and from three months' to one year's imprisonment. A work stoppage within the meaning of this legislative decree was deemed to occur where there was a collective cessation of activity, where establishments were forcibly closed other than in the circumstances provided for by law, and in the event of paralysis of channels of communication or other anti social acts. These provisions had the force of a special Act and had precedence over those of general Acts which were contrary to them.
.The strike of  May , continued the Government, had been prepared, inter alia, by Juan Vasquez Bastidas, Emilio Velasco and Jos Chvez Chvez, officials of one or other of the workers' associations, the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL, while other unions (bearing the same initials) had refused to be associated with the stoppage and had condemned it as an act of treason by the rank and file, requesting the support of the authorities to enable them to carry on with their daily work. The above-mentioned persons, in instigating the strike, had contravened Legislative Decree No .
.This Legislative Decree, added the Government, was supplemented by Presidential Decree No. , which specified the competent judicial authority and guarantees the rights of defendants. There accordingly existed a judicial institution, established by the State, to mete out punishment in the case of work stoppages and strikes organised unlawfully. The Government appended the text of this decree, adopted on  May . Section  confers upon general police intendants the status of special judges competent to deal with and pronounce judgement upon offences in connection with collective work stoppages; they must impose the penalties prescribed in Legislative Decree No. . Section  states that the procedure is to be that prescribed in section  of the Code of Criminal Procedure; sections , ,  and  of that Code are likewise to be observed. Section  specifies that special judges may, either on their own initiative or at the request of any administrative or judicial authority, take up a case and try the persons held to be criminally responsible for a collective work stoppage.
.The judgements handed down in respect of Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton, concluded the Government, had been pronounced in accordance with the legal rules in force in the country and the penalties had been imposed by the legally competent authority. There could, therefore, be no question as to the validity of their conviction.
.This case is mainly concerned with the general strike called on  May  by the CTE, the CEDOC and the CEOSL and another strike organised on the same day by the UNE. This work stoppage resulted in the sentencing, under an emergency procedure, of trade union leaders including Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton. The complainants also mention the arrest of another trade union leader, Julio Ayala Serra, and the outlawing of the UNE, but the Government has made no observations on the latter two points.
.As already pointed out by the Committee, Article  of Convention No.  recognises the right of trade union organisations",0,1977,Ecuador
286,"- i.e. workers' organisations for furthering and defending their occupational interests (Article ) - to formulate their programme of action and organise their activities; this entails not only the right to negotiate with employers but also the right to express their point of view on economic and social questions affecting their members' occupational interests. In view of this right that trade unions are thus recognised to have, the Committee has always considered that the right to strike is a legitimate and, indeed, an essential means whereby workers may promote and defend their occupational interests. But it has added that the right to strike constitutes a fundamental right of workers and their organisations only in so far as it is utilised as a means of defending their economic interests, that the prohibition of strikes designed to coerce the government, if they are not occupational in character, does not constitute an infringement of freedom of association, and that strikes of a purely political nature do not fall within the scope of the principles of freedom of association. In the present instance, a number of the demands made in connection with the strike of  May  were clearly occupational in character, while others were not.
.As concerns the claims of an economic or occupational nature, it further stems from the principles recalled in the previous paragraph that the right to strike - which, as the Committee has pointed out, must also be recognised in the case of trade union federations and Confederations - should not be restricted solely to industrial disputes likely to be resolved through the signing of a collective agreement. The Committee considers that workers and their organisations should be allowed to express in a broader context, if they so wish, any dissatisfaction they may feel as concerns economic and social matters affecting their members' occupational interests, so long as such action consists merely in the expression of a protest and is not intended as a breach of the peace.
.In the present case, Messrs. Juan Vazquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton have been sentenced to long terms of imprisonment and heavy fines as a result of the strike of  May  and in pursuance of Decrees Nos.  and , mentioned above. The first of these decrees punishes severely and in very broad terms collective stoppages of work. The Committee is of the opinion that this decree should be reviewed in the light of the considerations and principles set forth in the preceding paragraphs. The second, adopted only a few days after the strike in question, entrusts senior police officers with the responsibility of trying offenders; the sections of the Code of Criminal Procedure to which it refers apply in principle to breaches of the law; they provide for an expeditious procedure with no possibility of appeal.
.The Committee considers that this summary procedure lends itself to abuse, and that all arrested trade unionists should be subject to normal judicial procedure guaranteeing the rights of defence and conforming) to the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This instrument provides, inter alia, that everyone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law (Article , ).
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to draw the attention of the Government and the trade unions concerned to the considerations and principles respecting strikes set forth in paragraphs  and ;(b) to request the Government to review in this light Decree No.  of  June , and to consider the repeal, for the reasons stated in paragraph , of Presidential Decree No.  of  May ;(c) to request the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to follow developments in connection with the matter referred to in subparagraph (b) above;(d) to suggest to the Government the possibility of reconsidering the position of Messrs. Juan Vasquez Bastidas and Manuel Anton;(e) to request the Government to indicate the present position of Julio Ayala Serra and to forward its observations with respect to the outlawing of the UNE;(f) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  November . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.",0,1977,Ecuador
287,"farm had been on strike for three months. The group of persons directed by the co-proprietor of the farm burst into the room in which the workers were assembled, assailing them with blows and discharging their arms.
.As regards the events at the AZTRA refinery, the Government stated that a group of extremists had incited the workers with a view to achieving their terrorist objectives of driving the country into chaos. It enclosed with its communication two press cuttings containing statements made by the Under-Secretary of State for Labour regarding this case. The Under-Secretary's statements showed that a statement of claims had been submitted on  September to the Inspector of Labour at Caar. The employer's reply was received on  October. On  October the Inspector of Labour asked the employer to submit the two draft agreements mentioned in his reply. Moreover, the Ministry of Labour, in its capacity as arbitrator, summoned the two parties for mediation on  October, to which the latter signified their agreement on  October. Nevertheless, the following day ( October) the trade union leaders and members of the works Committee occupied the plant, chained and padlocked the doors and forced the seasonal workers to stop work. A document was then presented to the Labour Inspectorate in which it was stated that since the Tribunal had not given a decision within the time laid down by law, a strike had been called. Thus, continued the Under-Secretary of State, the strike was called after the premises had been occupied. It was also recalled that section  of the Labour Code obliged workers employed in the production, sale or distribution of essential foodstuffs to give notification of the work stoppage ten days in advance.
.As regards the intervention of the forces of law and order, the Under-Secretary of State declared that following a request of the management with a view to protecting the goods and rights of the undertaking, the Ministry of Labour had passed on the case to the ministry of the Interior. The latter then addressed a communication to the police authorities. Before intervening, the police called for the evacuation of the undertaking, the request being transmitted personally and directly by police officers. The latter were hoping to talk with the trade union leaders but these failed to appear. The most hot-headed workers indicated over the loudspeaker that they would not obey the orders of the police. A good many of the workers had already evacuated the area when the instigators of the strike appeared carrying sticks and arms thus preventing more than  men from leaving. When they attempted also to attack the sugar reserves the police were obliged to throw tear gas bombs. There was a rush towards the exit and in the resulting total confusion many workers fell into the irrigation canal surrounding the plant.
.The Government stated that following these events an agreement had been concluded on  December  ending the dispute and meeting the workers' demands. The agreement was signed by the General Director of the AZTRA company and by the General Secretary and three secretaries of the works Committee. With a view to settling the dispute, the firm undertakes to pay the workers a sum corresponding to a share in the increase in the price of sugar.
.As regards the events that occurred at the San Rafal farm, the Government stated that on  June  the workers in this undertaking had presented a statement of demands aimed at revising a collective agreement in force. The legislation provides that demands of this type are filed away, which was done in the present case. The workers' leaders occupied the farm and called an indefinite strike, disregarding the law. The labour authorities declared this strike illegal in accordance with Decree No. , dated  May , and Decree No. , dated  June . The employer submitted a request for the agreement of the labour authorities to his dismissing the workers on the grounds of repeated and unjustified offences and their failure to work for a period of more than three days. This request was examined by the authorities. The employer also requested the intervention of the police with a view to safeguarding private property. The police intervened, therefore, solely at the request of the person concerned and in accordance with the law.
.The Committee notes that the grave events referred to by the complainants occurred on the occasion of strikes organised in undertakings belonging to the sugar industry. In the Government's view these strikes were illegal because, in the case of the AZTRA undertaking, the notice required by the legislation had not been given and, in the case of the San Rafal farm, the demands were aimed at the revision of a collective agreement in force. In addition, the strikes in question had been accompanied by the occupation of the premises.
.Both cases led to police intervention resulting in the loss of human life, particularly heavy at the AZTRA refinery. The Committee notes the statement of the Under-Secretary of State for Labour describing the events that occurred at this refinery. It appears that the description given by him conflicts widely with the statements of the complainants as to the type of action taken by the police, the number of dead, the fact that persons were injured and the cause of death. On this last point, the complainants state that some people were killed by bullets and others were drowned while fleeing from the forces of law and order. According to the Government, the deaths were caused by drowning in the midst of total confusion. Moreover, the Government gives no details about the police intervention at the San Rafal farm whereas the complainants indicated that the workers assembled in the undertaking had been attacked by an armed group composed partly of members of the rural police.
.The Committee is obliged express its profound concern at the particularly grave nature of the events which occurred in these two undertakings, the more so since the explanations given by the Government do not make sufficiently clear the nature of the police intervention in these cases. Judging from the information available it does not appear that the attitude of the workers in the undertaking surrounded by the police was such as would have justified an intervention of the forces of law and order of such a type as to cause a heavy loss of human life. As regards the AZTRA undertaking, the Committee notes moreover that, two months following these events, an agreement was signed which appears to have met the demands submitted by the workers, the rejection of which had caused the strike.
.The Committee also observes that the complainants refer to the arrest of several trade union leaders. Since the Government has not replied to these allegations, the Committee would like the Government to forward information on the present position of these persons, and, in particular, as regards those still being detained and whether they have been brought before the courts.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to deplore the particularly grave nature of the events which occurred on the occasion of the strikes at the AZTRA refinery and the San Rafal farm;(b) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraphs  and  above respecting the intervention of the forces of law and order at these two undertakings;(c) to request the Government to supply information on the present position of the trade union leaders mentioned in paragraph  above and to indicate, in particular, which of them are still being detained and whether they have been brought before the courts;(d) to take note of this interim report.Geneva,  February .

288,"the considerations it set forth in its First Report and which it has subsequently repeated on many occasions: the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to such detailed factual charges as may be put forward.
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations relate, first of all, to the arrest of Pedro Antonio Brizuela, a trade union leader from San Pedro Sula, who is an active trade unionist belonging to the group of unions known as ""dissidents"" and adviser to a large number of unions in the region. He thus has connections with the Union of Workers in the National Construction Industry and the Union of Workers in the Drink and Related Industries. The complainants state that they are convinced that the person concerned is being harassed, at the instigation of the employers, by minor officials because of his trade union views. He is charged with conspiring against the Government which, according to the complainants, is an entirely unjustified accusation.
.The allegations also concern events that occurred in the Sula Dairies: according to the complainant organisation, the management dismissed the members of the union's executive and contrived, in the course of a manipulated meeting, to secure the appointment of a new executive, made up of persons whom the employer had won over.
.As regards the first of these allegations, the Committee has no information from the Government confirming or denying that Mr. Brizuela has been arrested and, if appropriate, giving the reasons for this measure. In dealing with complaints concerning the arrest of trade unionists, the Committee has always emphasised the importance it has attached to the principle of prompt and fair trial by an independent and impartial judiciary in all cases, including cases in which the trade unionists are charged with political or criminal offences which the government considers have no relation to their trade union functions. The Committee has also made a point of ascertaining the reasons for the detention in order to make sure that these have no connection with the trade union membership or activities of the persons being detained. To this end, it has followed the rule that the governments concerned should be requested to submit as precise information as possible concerning the facts held against the persons detained.
.As regards the alleged anti-trade union practices, the Committee wishes to recall the provision of Articles  and  of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Honduras. Article  provides that workers shall enjoy adequate protection against acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment. Trade union leaders are particularly in need of protection since the nature of their functions renders them more vulnerable than other people to such acts. Article  of the same Convention provides that workers' organisations, likewise, shall enjoy adequate protection against any acts of interference by employers (or employers' associations) in their establishment, functioning or administration.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to regret that in the absence of any reply from the Government, the Committee is unable to examine the views of the Government on this matter;(b) to draw the Government's attention to the principles and considerations set out in the preceding paragraphs with regard to the detention of trade unionists and protection against anti-trade union practices;(c) to urge the Government to communicate its observations in the near future on the various points raised in the complaint, and(d) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1977,Honduras
289,".Cases Nos.  and  were examined by the Committee in May , when it submitted an interim report.
.Since it last examined these cases the Committee has received communications from the former Government ( May ), the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) ( June ), the World Confederation of Labour ( June ), this same Confederation jointly with the world Federation for the Metallurgical Industry ( June ), the World Federation of Agricultural workers ( June ) and the new Government ( January ).
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection, of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Cases Nos.  and  concern various allegations which the Committee decided to classify under four headings in order to facilitate its examination of these cases.Allegations relating to measures taken against the CTN
.The complainants alleged that the headquarters of the Nicaraguan Central of Workers (CTN) had been raided by military and security forces and that a number of its leaders had been arrested and ill-treated while others had disappeared. The Government replied to these allegations by stating that no registered workers, association existed with the name of Nicaraguan Central of Workers. Referring to the reasons for the arrest of Messrs. Huembes and Velarde, mentioned by the complainants, the Government stated that their arrest was unconnected with their trade union activities, but related to other activities constituting a threat to the security of the State and a breach of the peace.
.At its May-June  Session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to furnish information as to the reasons for the raid on the CTN's headquarters as well as details of the specific acts of which Messrs. Huembes and Velarde had been accused, and in particular the nature of the material found in their possession.Allegations relating to the death of the trade union leader Luis Medrano Flores
.The complainants alleged that Mr. Luis Medrano Flores, General Secretary of the Confederation of Trade Union Unification, had been killed on  January  while distributing leaflets announcing a demonstration. The complainants claimed that the murder had been committed by members of a patrol frequently seen around district police station XIII, who were not in uniform and were travelling in a private can The Government replied that Mario Jos Prez Rodrguez had been identified as the killer of Mr. Medrano Flores and placed at the disposal of the judicial authorities, which had issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Prez Rodrguez and two persons who had been with him. The Government supplied the text of this arrest warrant.
.At its May-June  Session the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, expressed its concern over this murder and requested the Government to keep it informed as to the outcome of the legal proceedings initiated against the presumed murderer and his accomplices, and to supply the text of the judgement when it was pronounced, together with the reasons adduced therefore.Other allegations
.The complainants alleged that the home of Mr. Mariano Mendoza, Industrial Disputes Secretary of the Confederation of Trade Union Unification, had been raided by members of the National Guard, who had arrested one of his sons, and that Mr. Domingo Snchez Salgado, an official of the Nicaraguan General Confederation of Workers, had been arrested by the police. The Government replied that no repression was exercised against any trade union organisation or its members, and that it would supply further information when it received the reports it had requested from the competent authorities.
.When it last examined the case the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government for additional information on these allegations, and in particular on the alleged arrest of Mr. Snchez Salgado.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the raiding of the CTN's headquarters and the arrest of officials of that organisation, the Committee notes with interest the communication from the new Government and the statement by the CTN officials in question that they are at liberty and performing their trade union functions. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination. The same remark may be applied to the fresh allegations made by the CLAT, which also refer to the events involving the CTN.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the killing of the trade union leader Luis Medrano Flores, the Committee notes the information provided by the present Government. It feels bound to recall in general terms that a climate of violence such as that surrounding the killing of Luis Medrano Flores constitutes a serious impediment to the exercise of individual rights, and that accordingly such acts warrant the taking of severe measures by the authorities. In the present case, bearing in mind the developments that have taken place in the country since the complaints were presented, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee observes that the Government's communication makes no reference to the allegations mentioned in paragraph  of this report.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the raiding of the CTN's headquarters, the arrest of officials of that organisation and the death of Mr. Luis Medrano Flores, to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and  above, that these aspects of the case do not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to inform the Committee as to the present situation of the on of Mr. Mariano Mendoza, an official of the Confederation of Trade Union Unification, and of Mr. Domingo Snchez Salgado, an official of the Nicaraguan General Confederation of Workers, who according to the complainants were arrested in .
.The complaints are contained in various communications sent by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), on  February and  October  and  April , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), on  March  and  April , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), on  January and  April , and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), on  January,  February and  March . The Government has furnished observations on the matters raised in the complaints by communications dated  May , ,  and  February and  and  March .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern over the grave allegations relating to the murder and detention of trade unionists, violation of trade union premises and the generally insecure position of trade unionists;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union officials in the health sector, to decide, in the light of the information supplied by the Government (see paragraph  above), that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(c) as regards the allegations concerning the measures taken against the CTN to point out that if an organisation has not been officially recognised there is no justification for the rejection of allegations where it is clear from the complaints that this organisation has at least a de facto existence; and to urge the Government to furnish as soon as possible additional information as to the reasons for the raid on the headquarters of that organisation in February , and as to the specific acts of which Messrs. Carlos Huembes and Enrique Velarde were accused (and, in particular, the nature of the material found in their possession), as well as its observations on the re-arrest of Mr. Velarde in April ;(d) as regards the allegations concerning the death of the trade union leader Luis Medrano Flores, to express its concern and to urge the Government to keep it informed as to the outcome of the legal proceedings initiated against the presumed murderer and his accomplices, and to supply the text of the judgement when it is pronounced, together with the reasons adduced therefor;(e) as regards the other allegations mentioned in paragraph  above, to request the Government to supply as a matter of urgency the additional information promised by it as indicated in paragraph  and its observations on the alleged arrest of Mr. Snchez Salgado;(f) to take note of this interim report.",0,1978,Nicaragua
290,"trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating",-1,1978,El Salvador
291,"the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.
.Cases Nos.  and  were examined by the Committee in May and November , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Case No.  was examined by the Committee in November  and May , on both of which occasions it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since it last examined these cases the Committee has received communications from the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur porkers ( October ), the Latin American Central of Workers ( April  and  August ) and the World Confederation of Labour ( September ). The Government sent two communications dated  and  December .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining - Convention,  (No. ).
.Case No.  concerns various allegations, one of which refers to incidents which occurred on  October  during a strike at the El Len factory, when workers were attacked by the police and two of them lost their lives. Other allegations relate to the arrest and torture of  workers of the undertaking Quality food de Centro Amrica and the arrest of  workers and disappearance of two trade union officials during an attack on the offices of two trade unions. According to the complainants all these situations fitted into the general pattern since the passage of an ""anti-terrorist Act"" designed to legalise the repression of the workers.
.Case No.  referred to the imprisonment of a peasant militant, Francisco Girn Ramos, who had been charged with slandering the authorities of Rosario de Mora. According to the complainants the real reason for this arrest lay in the trade union activities of Mr. Girn.
.In Case No.  the complainants alleged that the Government had launched a bloodthirsty campaign of persecution against agricultural workers and their organisations, resulting in many deaths, injuries and arrests.
.In connection with the above allegations the Government stated that various self-styled trade union groups were operating unlawfully, propagating anarchist and anti-democratic doctrines prohibited by the Political Constitution, and committing criminal acts. It was members of these groups, continues the Government, who killed Mr. Trnsito Vsquez. The Government professed its respect for freedom, but said that breaches of the law had occurred and that they would be punished by the competent authorities. In connection with the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, the Government said that his release had been ordered and that proceedings had been instituted against him for the destruction of original documents; the text of the judgement would be communicated once it had been handed down.
.At its May-June  Session, in connection with Case No. , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to communicate the text of the judgement rendered in the case of Francisco Girn Ramos, with the reasons adduced therefore.
.At its November  Session, in connection with cases Nos.  and , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to send its observations on the situation of various trade unionists named in an annex, and on the other aspects of the case referred to in paragraphs  to  and  of the Committee's th Report, and to communicate the judgement to be pronounced in the case concerning the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, with the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee has so far not received the information requested.
.In a letter of  October  the Trades Onion International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers alleges that Jos Guillermo Rivas Gonzlez, General Secretary of the Union of workers in the Cotton, Kenaf, Synthetic Fibre and Allied Textile Industries of El Salvador, was murdered on  September , and that Miguel Angel Solis and Orlando Platero, officials of the Union of Textile Industry Workers, were murdered on  September ; the reason for these alleged murders is said to be the trade union activity of the victims it is also alleged that other trade union officials have been imprisoned.
.By a telegram of  April  the Latin American Central of porkers alleges that the workers of the unions of the national undertakings La Peca, La Constancia, Embotelladora Tropical and STECEL were harshly repressed by the Government because they had demanded collective labour contracts; as a result, seven leaders and militants of these unions have been killed and a number injured.
.By letter of  August  the Latin American Central of workers sends a list of  primary-school teachers allegedly murdered with ""the undisguised complicity of the educational authorities of the country"". In addition to mentioning the full names of the teachers, the list indicates their trade union activities or their relationship with the trade union organisations, their place of work, and the date, place and circumstances of their deaths. In the same letter CLAT repeats the need for the urgent dispatch of a special mission to investigate the situation complained of.
.By a communication of  September  the world Confederation of Labour alleges that some  workers of the IMES undertaking (Industrial Manufactureras, S.A.) in the Republic of El Salvador have been deprived of their work for over three months, and that the undertaking has failed to fulfil its legal and contractual obligations; WCL requests that this document should be attached to the complaints against the Government of El Salvador for systematic violation of labour and trade union rights and ""that the authorities should be asked to take the necessary measures to secure respect for the rights of the workers in order to defend them against the manoeuvres of the foreign firm"".
.By letters of  and  December  the Government has replied to the international Labour office in connection with",0,1978,El Salvador

.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection, of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.Cases Nos.  and  concern various allegations which the Committee decided to classify under four headings in order to facilitate its examination of these cases.Allegations relating to measures taken against the CTN
.The complainants alleged that the headquarters of the Nicaraguan Central of Workers (CTN) had been raided by military and security forces and that a number of its leaders had been arrested and ill-treated while others had disappeared. The Government replied to these allegations by stating that no registered workers, association existed with the name of Nicaraguan Central of Workers. Referring to the reasons for the arrest of Messrs. Huembes and Velarde, mentioned by the complainants, the Government stated that their arrest was unconnected with their trade union activities, but related to other activities constituting a threat to the security of the State and a breach of the peace.
.At its May-June  Session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government to furnish information as to the reasons for the raid on the CTN's headquarters as well as details of the specific acts of which Messrs. Huembes and Velarde had been accused, and in particular the nature of the material found in their possession.Allegations relating to the death of the trade union leader Luis Medrano Flores
.The complainants alleged that Mr. Luis Medrano Flores, General Secretary of the Confederation of Trade Union Unification, had been killed on  January  while distributing leaflets announcing a demonstration. The complainants claimed that the murder had been committed by members of a patrol frequently seen around district police station XIII, who were not in uniform and were travelling in a private can The Government replied that Mario Jos Prez Rodrguez had been identified as the killer of Mr. Medrano Flores and placed at the disposal of the judicial authorities, which had issued a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Prez Rodrguez and two persons who had been with him.

.When it last examined the case the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, requested the Government for additional information on these allegations, and in particular on the alleged arrest of Mr. Snchez Salgado.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the raiding of the CTN's headquarters and the arrest of officials of that organisation, the Committee notes with interest the communication from the new Government and the statement by the CTN officials in question that they are at liberty and performing their trade union functions. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination. The same remark may be applied to the fresh allegations made by the CLAT, which also refer to the events involving the CTN.
.With regard to the allegations relating to the killing of the trade union leader Luis Medrano Flores, the Committee notes the information provided by the present Government. It feels bound to recall in general terms that a climate of violence such as that surrounding the killing of Luis Medrano Flores constitutes a serious impediment to the exercise of individual rights, and that accordingly such acts warrant the taking of severe measures by the authorities. In the present case, bearing in mind the developments that have taken place in the country since the complaints were presented, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee observes that the Government's communication makes no reference to the allegations mentioned in paragraph  of this report.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with regard to the allegations relating to the raiding of the CTN's headquarters, the arrest of officials of that organisation and the death of Mr. Luis Medrano Flores, to decide, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs  and  above, that these aspects of the case do not call for further examination;(b) to request the Government to inform the Committee as to the present situation of the on of Mr. Mariano Mendoza, an official of the Confederation of Trade Union Unification, and of Mr. Domingo Snchez Salgado, an official of the Nicaraguan General Confederation of Workers, who according to the complainants were arrested in .
.The complaints are contained in various communications sent by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), on  February and  October  and  April , the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), on  March  and  April , the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), on  January and  April , and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), on  January,  February and  March . The Government has furnished observations on the matters raised in the complaints by communications dated  May , ,  and  February and  and  March .
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern over the grave allegations relating to the murder and detention of trade unionists, violation of trade union premises and the generally insecure position of trade unionists;(b) as regards the allegations concerning the arrest of trade union officials in the health sector, to decide, in the light of the information supplied by the Government (see paragraph  above), that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(c) as regards the allegations concerning the measures taken against the CTN to point out that if an organisation has not been officially recognised there is no justification for the rejection of allegations where it is clear from the complaints that this organisation has at least a de facto existence; and to urge the Government to furnish as soon as possible additional information as to the reasons for the raid on the headquarters of that organisation in February , and as to the specific acts of which Messrs. Carlos Huembes and Enrique Velarde were accused (and, in particular, the nature of the material found in their possession), as well as its observations on the re-arrest of Mr. Velarde in April ;(d) as regards the allegations concerning the death of the trade union leader Luis Medrano Flores, to express its concern and to urge the Government to keep it informed as to the outcome of the legal proceedings initiated against the presumed murderer and his accomplices, and to supply the text of the judgement when it is pronounced, together with the reasons adduced therefor;(e) as regards the other allegations mentioned in paragraph  above, to request the Government to supply as a matter of urgency the additional information promised by it as indicated in paragraph  and its observations on the alleged arrest of Mr. Snchez Salgado;(f) to take note of this interim report.",0,1978,Nicaragua

It presented interim conclusions on them in its th Report (paras. -), nd Report (paras. -) and th Report (paras. -). These reports were approved by the Governing Body at its rd Session (May-June ), th Session (November ) and th Session (February-March ). Further allegations have been made by the National Union of Health Workers ( May and  June ) since the case was last examined.
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee takes note of the Government's observations on the measures taken to reinstate in their employment a number of workers who were dismissed on the occasion of the  strike at the Colombian Social Insurance Institute. It expresses the hope that it will be possible to take further measures to promote the reinstatement of the other workers concerned. Finally, it notes the information furnished by the Government regarding the envisaged adoption of a new statute for the teaching profession. The Committee would like to be kept informed of any progress in this area.
.Regarding the allegations made by the Health Employees' Union ( May and  June ), which refer in particular to dismissals of trade union leaders, the Government's reply of  August  reached the Office on  October . This aspect of the case will be examined by the Committee at its next session.
.In these circumstances, and as regards the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the allegations relating to the undertaking Shellmar de Colombia, SA, to decide, in the light of the earlier conclusions reached by the Committee in its th Report, that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the suspension of trade unions by administrative authority, to take note of the Government's statement that it has since  refrained from making use of these powers which are conferred upon it by the Labour Code, and to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of progress made in the current work to bring the legislation into conformity with Article  of Convention No. , which expressly forbids the suspension or dissolution of organisations by administrative authority;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the death of an indigenous leader and the arrest of a leader of the National Agrarian Federation, to take note of the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the judgements in these cases have not yet been rendered, and to request it to supply the texts of these judgements as soon as they become available, with the reasons adduced therefore;(d) to take note of the Government's observations on the re-instatement in their employment of a number of workers who were dismissed on the occasion of the  strike at the Colombian Social Insurance Institute, and to express the hope that it will be possible to adopt new measures to promote the reinstatement of the other workers concerned;(e) to take note of the Government's statement that work designed to secure the adoption of new statute for the teaching profession - with which workers' representatives have been associated - is continuing, and to request it to keep the Committee informed of any progress which may be made in this area; to note that the allegations relating to the dismissals of trade union leaders in the health sector and the Government's reply will be examined by the Committee at its next session;(f) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee has considered it appropriate to examine together the matters still outstanding in Case No.  and the allegations made in Case No. . The Government has furnished observations with respect to both cases in a communication dated  November .
.Colombia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with regard to these cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body;(a) as regards the allegations relating to the death of the indigenous leader Justiniano Lame and the arrest of an official of the National Agrarian Federation:(i) to draw the Government's attention once again to the importance it attaches to the speedy and full elucidation of cases involving the death of a trade unionist and the threat to the exercise of trade union rights implied by the detention of trade unionists concerning whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found;(ii) to note that the trade union official arrested has been provisionally released;(iii) to request the Government once again to furnish as soon as possible the text of the judgements handed down in respect of both these cases;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the trade union rights of workers at the Colombian Social Insurance Institute and in the teaching profession:(i) to note that the right to bargain collectively has been granted by decree to the employees of the Institute to whom the complaint refers, and to request the Government once again to forward its observations on the allegations to the effect that over  trade union officials and workers were dismissed as a consequence of a strike in ;(ii) to request the Government once more to supply information on the results of the new study which, according to an earlier communication from the Government, was being made of the situation of workers in the teaching profession;(c) as regards the allegations relating to the suspension of industrial associations within the Colombian Mineral water Enterprise, to draw the Government's attention, in accordance with the considerations set forth in paragraph  above, to the desirability of amending the provisions of the legislation relating to the suspension or dissolution of industrial associations so as to bring them fully into line with Article  of Convention No. ; to note that the Government proposes to refer a commission to the Committee's recommendations on the harmonising of its legislation with that article, and to request the Government in the meantime to indicate whether an appeal lies to the courts against administrative decisions as at present provided for, specifying also what is the effect of an appeal, and by what provisions the matter is governed;(d) as regards the allegations relating to the undertaking Shellmar de Colombia, S.A.:(i) to note the information supplied by the Government concerning the arrangement concluded between the parties with respect to time off to attend to union business;(ii) bearing in mind the considerations set forth in paragraph  above, to request the complaining organisation to furnish before the Committee's next session any comments it wishes to make with respect to the information supplied by the Government as indicated in paragraphs  to  above;(e) to take note of this interim report.",0,1978,Colombia
294,"of the facts.
.On the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body requested the Government to give its consent to a representative of the Director-General visiting El Salvador at an early date to examine the allegations made within the context of the direct contacts procedure.
.In a Letter of  June  the Government states that self-styled peasant groups, calling themselves the ""Federation of Catholic Peasants of EL Salvador"" (FECCAS) and the ""Union of Field Labourers"" (UTC) have taken advantage of the freedom of expression enjoyed by the population to cake public statements on various occasions - for instance on  May  in the newspaper La Crnica - that they form the basis of a clandestine organisation, the ""People's Revolutionary Bloc"" (BPR), to appeal to all workers to give their ""organised and militant support to the people's cause"" within the Revolutionary Council of Trade Unions (CSR) and to eliminate ""tendencies opposing their class interests which can only mislead the proletariat and confuse their minds ..."". These various groups, adds the Government, operate unlawfully, not only because they have not been granted legal personality by the State but also because they are propagating anarchist and anti-democratic doctrines prohibited by section  of the Constitution.
.In their issues of ,  and  March , continues the Government, national newspapers with wide readership ( a Prensa Grfica, Diario de Hoy, Diario Latino and Diario el Mundo) reported that religious organisations of peasants such as the Bloc, Led by recognised agents of international communism, have progressed from political propaganda to purely criminal acts such as sacking, destroying and burning the humble homes of peasants who are unwilling to abide by their watchwords of hatred, violence and death; the Government is saddened by the pictures of many groups of families who have fled these attacks. Other citizens have been faced with the choice between joining the Bloc or suffering the consequences of its ""militancy"". The victims of such acts include  dead and many wounded; the newspapers have reported a number of atrocities committed by members of FECCAS, UTC and BPR, particularly on Trnsito Vsquez after they had killed him. Members of these groups injure people, tie them up and stone them, and travel around in gangs shouting threats over loud-speakers.
.Following instructions received from abroad, continues the Government, the enemies of El Salvador have set a characteristic pattern for internal strife by highly unconventional means ranging from sedition and subversion to smear campaigns abroad which disguise reality and present a false image of the country to friendly nations. The Government adds that it is not its intention to make a secret of social and economic problems, but that patriotic citizens are convinced that these problems must be solved with the participation of all sectors in the country, in a peaceful and orderly manner and with scrupulous respect for the Law. They oppose the class struggle which is being fomented in some quarters and the violence advocated by others. They are partisans of a humanist and democratic approach affording each individual the opportunity for self-development. The Government believes that the status of an individual is determined by his efforts, his capacities and his conduct and not by noble birth or inherited wealth. It seeks the welfare of all without prejudice to the rights of others, in the conviction that social equilibrium is to be found in mutual understanding of the rights and duties of each citizen. Peace cannot exist without justice, says the Government, but justice cannot exist without the maintenance of the peaceful climate which is a prerequisite for constructive work and without means of defence against subversive conspiracy; security is essential for the promotion of economic development, which brings social progress and justice in its train.
.The Government adds that the acts committed by elements of FECCAS, UTC and BPR are designated as offences within the competence of the penal court by the Act respecting the defence and maintenance of public order. The penal court has examined four files, from which it transpires that:(a) the persons who were prosecuted acted in their capacity as members of FECCAS and UTC, both of which are members of the BPR, and were either the authors of the crimes or accessories thereto;(b) the accused have appointed counsel for the defence, and steps have been taken to enable the counsel to intervene on their behalf;(c) the accused, Mximo Garcia Lpez, Jose Felipe Matas Vsquez and Sarbelio Garcia Ramirez, cite the names of Tranquilino Prez, Faustino Vsquez and Marcelino Prez, all members of the above-mentioned subversive organisations, as being responsible for the death of Trnsito Vsquez, having put him to death because he refused to take part in the crimes committed against the peasants of the townships of EL Rodeo, La Esperanza, Tecoluco and Miraflores in the circumscription of San Pedro Perulupa; these allegations were corroborated by the testimony of other persons who were present when the aforesaid accused made their extra-judicial statements; these witnesses are not members of the security forces and, when they questioned the accused as to whether their statements were spontaneous, they were told that this was the case;(d) the persons involved took part in the attack on the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare in November .The documents of the trial are available for consultation by persons who are duly authorised by the Law..The Government rejects allegations that it persecutes trade union organisations of all kinds. On the contrary, it points out that there are  trade unions with legal personality carrying on their activities in full freedom and quotes many other figures relating to trade union sections, federations and Confederations, collective Labour agreements, etc. The Government also indicates that the unions have been able to elect workers' representatives to the management board of the Social Security Institute of EL Salvador, the National Minimum Wage Council and the Social Housing Fund.

.Finally, the Government reaffirms its respect for individual rights, including freedom of association. It encourages the formation of trade unions and collective bargaining; it protects organisations in the exercise of their functions in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. It does not, however, countenance any violation of the Law which may be under investigation by the competent authorities, since the independence of the authorities of the State in their respective legal capacities is respected in the country and their competence cannot be delegated to other bodies.
.In a telegram of  July  the WCL and the WCAW allege that Pedro Lpez, a member of the executive Committee of the Latin American Peasant Federation, has been arrested at Cojutepeque and that his whereabouts are unknown. CLAT refers to the same facts in its communication of  July , adding that the person concerned is General Secretary of the Peasant Federation of El Salvador and a member of the national executive of the Confederation of Workers of El Salvador. He is said to have been arrested and beaten by the security forces on  July .
.The Government has not yet replied to these various allegations.
.WCL and WCAW recently presented further allegations in a letter dated  October . These allegations, which refer to the break-up of a union in an INCA undertaking, have been transmitted to the Government for observations.
.The Committee will examine at its next session, in the light of the reply received from the Government, the question of establishing direct contacts to clarify the issues raised in the present cases.
.The Committee notes the information communicated by the Government. The latter replies partially to the serious allegations made, giving details only on the legal proceedings taken following the death of Trnsito Vsquez and on the identity of the presumed authors of the homicide. In this connection the Committee notes the contradictions between this information and the content of the complaints. It would like to receive a copy of the judgement to be given in this case and detailed information on all the other aspects of the cases.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the reply of the Government as regards the trade union situation as a whole and as regards the particular case of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez;(b) to request the Government to send its observations by  January  at the latest on the situation of the trade unionists named in the Annex hereto and on the other aspects of the case referred to in paragraphs  to  and , and to communicate the judgement to be pronounced in the case concerning the death of",-1,1978,El Salvador
295,"Mr. Vsquez, with the reasons adduced therefor;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee has already examined Case No.  at its sessions in November  and February , when it submitted interim conclusions to the Governing Body in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its st Session (November ), and in paragraphs  to  of its th Report, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (March ).
.The complaints and additional information were presented by  trade union organisations of El Salvador and by the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES) and the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA). The Government of El Salvador, for its part, sent observations on the various allegations made.
.More recently, the world Confederation of Labour presented a complaint by communication of  April , and sent additional information in a communication of  April . This complaint figured as Case No. .
.The Committee has decided to deal in a single report with the questions still outstanding from Case No.  and the new complaint contained in Case No. .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In case No.  FUSS and FESTIAVTSCES pressed for the appointment of a commission or the dispatch of a representative of the Director-General for an on-the-spot study of the allegations made in the complaint. At its February  meeting the Committee decided to postpone the examination of this request.
.In Case No.  WCL requests that a commission should immediately be sent to examine the allegations, since it is of the opinion that neither fundamental human rights nor trade union rights are respected in El Salvador, where there are persecutions of trade unions in general and agricultural workers' unions in particular.
.When the Committee examined the complaints in Case No.  at its February  session, it noted the gravity of the allegations made by the complainants. Following the recommendation of the Committee the Governing Body expressed its deep concern at the acts committed against trade unions or their leaders which remained unexplained and their harmful implications for the functioning of trade union organisations and the development of industrial relations in the country.
.The most recent complaint made by WCL in Case No.  also contains extremely serious allegations in respect of many workers and trade unionists who are said to have been killed, injured or arrested.
.In the light of all these circumstances the Committee considers that resort should be had to the direct contacts procedure, under which a representative of the Director-General is sent to the country for discussions with the public authorities and contacts with the workers' and employers' organisations, and to determine the facts and study possible solutions. The representative would then submit his report to the Committee, which would be able to examine the allegations and formulate its own conclusions with better knowledge of the facts.
.In this respect the Committee wishes to stress that the object of the procedure is to guarantee the respect of freedom of association both in law and in fact; it is convinced that this procedure can protect governments against unfounded accusations, provided that they recognise the importance for their own good name of collaborating fully with the Committee to enable it to undertake a thorough examination of the allegations and seek solutions to the problems.",-1,1978,El Salvador
296,".The Committee has considered it advisable to examine the allegations remaining outstanding in Case No.  together with the allegations presented in Case No. . The Government has submitted observations and further information in respect of both matters in two letters dated  and  January .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances, and with respect to both cases as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note with interest the further information communicated by the Government, according to which at the present time no trade union leader is under arrest for reasons connected with the general strike of  July , nor in connection with other trade union activities;(b) to note also the measure of amnesty and general pardon decreed by the Government and affecting all those being tried or having been sentenced in connection with the said strike, and to decide, in the circumstances, that there would be no point in continuing to examine this aspect of the case;(c) to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of the steps taken to reconsider the situation of the workers who were dismissed as a result of the strike and to restore free collective bargaining;(d) as regards the allegations concerning the expulsion from the country of the Venezuelan trade unionist, Luis Hernndez, and in view of the information communicated by the complainants and by the Government, to decide that these allegations call for no further examination but to draw the attention of both parties to the principles and considerations set out in paragraph  above.",0,1978,Peru
297,"the complaints. According to it, the Government of the Revolutionary Junta of El Salvador, since its installation on  October , has adopted a policy entirely different from that of earlier regimes, a policy of absolute respect for human rights, including freedom of association; it accepts no responsibility for any violations which may have occurred in the past.
.The Committee notes the statement made in December  by the new Government that it will follow a policy of respect for human rights, including the aspects relating to freedom of association. Nevertheless, the Committee considers that a general statement of this nature does not provide the elements of information necessary for the elucidation of the present cases, since they are part of a well-defined series of circumstances and situations the examination of which requires it to be in possession of the information which the Governing Body has requested of the Government on repeated occasions.
.The Committee recalls that on earlier occasions, when examining allegations relating to the violation of trade union rights by a government, it has emphasised that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. In this sense, the Committee has taken the view that, where a change of regime has taken place in a country, the new government should take all necessary steps to remedy any continuing effects which events complained of as having taken place under its predecessor might have had since its accession to power.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to take note of the statement made in December  of the new Government that it has adopted a policy of respect for human rights, including aspects relating to freedom of association;(b) to request the Government to send:(i) information in connection with paragraphs  and  of the present report, respecting the proceedings against Mr. Francisco Girn Ramos, the present situation of the various trade unionists listed in the annex to this case, the accusations of torture and persecution of trade unionists and trade union organisations, the stage reached in the proceedings in connection with the death of Mr. Trnsito Vsquez, and the incidents which occurred during a strike of workers of the El Len factory;(ii) its observations on the new allegations referred to in paragraphs , ,  and  of the present report, relating to the murder of the workers, trade union officials and primary-school teachers mentioned in the annex to this case, to the repression of workers and trade unions which demanded collective labour agreements, and to the situation of  workers of the IMES undertaking;(c) to take note of the present interim report.
.The Committee last examined these cases in May , when it submitted interim conclusions in paragraphs  to  of its st Report. This report was approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (- June ).
.The complaints were presented by  trade union organisations of El Salvador and by the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES) and the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), and, with respect to Case No. , the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) and the World Confederation of Agricultural Workers (WCAW). The Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) also presented a complaint relating to the latter case by a communication of  July .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations outstanding in Case No.  referred firstly to incidents which had occurred during a strike at the El Lon factory. According to the complaint (dated  October ) the workers who had been preparing to organise a collection in support of the strike had been attacked by the police and two of them had lost their lives.
.The complainants further alleged that the following trade union leaders had been tortured during their imprisonment in July : Romeo Soto Crespo, Gilberto Ruiz Ponce, Miguel Rivera Valle, Rufino Gonzlez Avelar, Teresa Francisca Maldonado (who subsequently disappeared) and Ricardo Erazo (arrested in January ). They also mentioned the disappearance, in January , of Rafael Antonio Martinez, a member of the executive of the Leather Workers' Union.
.Other complaints referred to arrests. It was alleged that the firm ""Lcteas Foremost"" had helped to bring about the arrest of the following persons: Jos Napolen Mina, Carlos Humberto Gonzlez, officials of the employees' union of the company, arrested on  March ; Jos Mauricio Gmez, an official of the same union, arrested on  April; Jos Ricardo Martinez Flores, an official of the National Trade Union Federation of the Salvadorian Workers (FENASTRAS), arrested on  March; and Carlos Ernesto Marin Ayala, arrested on  May. Furthermore, Hctor Antonio Acevedo, an official of the union of the ""Cosmos"" undertaking, had been arrested at Santa Ana on  October . According to the complainants the Government had promulgated an ""anti-territorist Act"" designed to legalise the repression of the workers. Thus, on  December ,  workers of the undertaking ""Quality Food de Centro Amrica"" had been arrested and had been released the next day after being tortured. On  December the arrest had taken place of Rodolfo Hernndez Rosales and Miguel Guzmn, officials of the workers' union of the ""Alianza"" undertaking, and Daniel Garca Guevara, an official of the workers' union of the ""Famosa"" undertaking.
.On  November , the complainants alleged, the national guard had raided the premises of the Puerto El Triunfo Fish Industries Employees' Union and had arrested the following militants and officials: Alejandro Molina Lara, Julio C. Salazar, Oscar L. Chaves, Delia Cristina Hernndez and Juan Francisco Alvarenga.
.As regards Case No.  the complainants stated that the Government had launched a campaign of bloody persecution against agricultural workers and their organisations, in particular against the Salvadorian Agricultural Workers' Federation, resulting in more than  killed and many wounded, in the towns of El Rodeo, La Esperanza, Tecoluco and San Pedro Perulupa. According to the complainant many agricultural workers' leaders had been arrested. On  March , continued the complainant, Trnsito Vsquez, a local leader of FECCAS in the town of La Esperanza, had been murdered by members of the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), a paramilitary government organisation. His body had been found the next day, covered with wounds, and there were indications that he had been tortured. According to the complainants all the available information led to the assumption that the large-scale demonstrations by agricultural workers in the towns of Tecoluco, La Esperanza, Tenancingo, El Rodeo and San Pedro Perulupa, which were held in the following days, should be considered as a reaction of indignation at the murder and at the fact that a number of helicopters of the armed forces had fired on the crowd during the funeral of Trnsito Vsquez.
.The Government had not at that time sent its observations on the various allegations.
.In Case No.  certain complainants had pressed for the appointment of a commission or the dispatch of a representative of the Director-General for an on-the-spot study of the allegations made in the complaint. In Case No. , WCL requested that a commission should immediately be sent to examine the allegations, since it was of the opinion that neither fundamental human rights nor trade union rights were respected in El Salvador, where there were persecutions of trade unions in general and agricultural workers' unions in particular. As early as February  the Committee had noted the gravity of the allegations made by the complainants (in Case No. ). Following its recommendation the Governing Body had at that time expressed its deep concern at the acts committed against trade unions or their leaders which remained unexplained and their harmful implications for the functioning of trade union organisations and the development of industrial relations in the country. The subsequent complaint (Case No. ) also contained extremely serious allegations in respect of many workers and trade unionists who were said to have been killed, injured or arrested.
.In these circumstances the Committee considered in May  that resort should be had to the direct contacts procedure, under which a representative of the Director-General would be sent to the country for discussions with the public authorities and contacts with the workers' and employers' organisations, in order to determine the facts and study possible solutions. The representative of the Director-General would then submit his report to the Committee, which would be able to examine the allegations and formulate its own conclusions with better knowledge",1,1978,El Salvador
298,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) dated  July . The WCL supplied additional information by a further communication dated  September . The Government forwarded its observations in a communication dated  January .
.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its first communication the WCL states that it has come to its knowledge that infringement of freedom of association is continuing in Peru on an increasing scale. The complainant organisation alleges that the Government has unleashed a violent campaign of repression against education workers, that numerous primary and secondary schoolteachers have been dismissed from their employment, that a number of schools have been closed and that many teaching staff have been imprisoned and ill-treated and their trade unions dismantled. The WCL considers that an ILO commission should be sent to Peru as a matter of urgency to see the situation for itself and demand that the Government put an end to this open persecution of trade unions. In its second communication, the WCL confirms its desire to present a formal complaint against the Government of Peru for infringement of freedom of association, the right to organise and the right to strike, adding that workers belonging to the National Metal Mining Federation of Peru have also been afflicted by the problem of dismissal, physical ill-treatment and imprisonment. Furthermore, according to the complainant organisation, Legislative Decrees Nos.  and , promulgated by the Government, are prejudicial to the job security of more than , public employees. The WCL requests the ILO to intervene to secure the repeal of these measures, which it qualifies as anti-unionist.
.In its reply, transmitted on  January , the Government points out that in this case no specific allegation has been made, and the communications received are so vague and imprecise that it is unable to comment on them. The Government vigorously rejects any insinuation that workers have been wrongfully dismissed, imprisoned or ill-treated. It adds that these assertions are completely untrue and damaging to the Government's international image, which is characterised by the humanitarian and Christian spirit which marks its administration.
.The Government has supplied the texts of the two legislative degrees mentioned in the complaint, both dated  August . Legislative Decree No.  lays down rules for the reorganisation of public expenditure under the present budget, with a view, inter alia, to reducing current expenditure so as to be able to invest more. Among other miscellaneous provisions, it authorises a reduction in staff through the curtailment of non-essential activities and programmes. Legislative Decree No.  lays down the rules applicable to the workers affected by this reduction in staff, which provide for the payment during an eight-month period of an allowance equivalent to the last monthly earnings, entitlement to a pension by way of severance pay and facilities for obtaining loans.
.The Committee observes that the allegations referring to dismissals, imprisonment and other measures for which the Government is held responsible are not accompanied by more precise information as to the circumstances in which the alleged infringements of freedom of association took place, nor as to the names of the trade unionists affected. The complaining organisation, in availing itself of the opportunity afforded to it under the procedure to supply additional information, has likewise failed to specify the reasons why it considers that the promulgation - or application - of the two legislative decrees mentioned above implies infringement of trade union rights. The Government, for its part, has declared the allegations to be untrue.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, for the reasons indicated in the preceding paragraph, that this case does not call for further examination.",0,1978,Peru
299,"in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the",0,1978,El Salvador
300,".Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly,",-1,1978,El Salvador
301,".The complaint presented by the National Association of Public Employees (ANEP) is contained in a communication of  October  and that of the General Confederation of workers (CGT) in two communications of  November and  December . In a communication dated  January , the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) associated itself with the complaint presented by the CGT. The Government sent its observations on the ANEP complaint in a communication dated  April  (received on  May) and its observations on the CGT complaint in another communication dated  July .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee wishes to recall that, under Article  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), which Costa Rica has ratified, measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiations between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements. Under the terms of Article , this Convention does not deal with the position of public servants engaged in the administration of the State. The Committee has stated that Convention No. , and in particular Article  thereof concerning the encouragement and promotion of collective bargaining, applies both to the private sector and to nationalised undertakings and public bodies, it being possible to exclude from such application public servants engaged in the administration of the State. In the same spirit, the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has expressed the view that a distinction should be drawn in this respect between civil servants employed in various capacities in government ministries or comparable bodies, that is, public servants who by their functions are directly engaged in the administration of the State as well as lower-ranking officials who act as supporting elements in these activities, and other persons employed by the Government, by public undertakings or by autonomous public institutions.,
.In these circumstances, the Committee feels it must draw the Government's attention to the considerations outlined in the foregoing paragraph and to the desirability of ensuring that no measure liable to hamper the collective bargaining process is applied to the latter category of workers.
.In these circumstances and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) with respect to the allegations relating to the attitude of the authorities towards the National Association of Public Employees and in the light of the considerations contained in paragraphs  and  above, to take note that the issues raised in the complaint have been settled and to decide that these aspects of the case do not call for further examination;(b) with regard to the allegations concerning the attitude of the authorities towards the General Confederation of Workers:(i) bearing in mind the principles and considerations outlined in paragraphs  to  above, to take note that the complainants have not provided proof that the statements made by government personalities referred to in the complaint, constitute an infringement of freedom of association;(ii) to take note of the information supplied by the Government regarding the collective disputes referred to in the complaint and to point out that compulsory conciliation before calling a strike does not constitute an infringement of freedom of association;(iii) with respect to the provisions of Articles  and  of the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), to draw the Government's attention to the considerations contained in paragraph  above and to the desirability of ensuring that no measure liable to hamper the process of collective bargaining is applied to workers in the public sector who are not public servants in the administration of the State;(iv) to draw these conclusions to the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",1,1978,Costa Rica
302,".This case was considered by the Committee in November , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since it last considered the case, the Committee has received communications sent by the Government on  January and  February .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations to be considered relate to the arrest of the national executive of the Peruvian Telephone Workers' Union which, according to the complainants, was exclusively for trade union reasons. They also relate to the situation at the CROMOTEX textile mill which was raided by the police on the occasion of a strike, a civil guard being killed and a number of workers killed or wounded; as a result of this several workers have been charged.
.In its reply the Government stated that two persons were dismissed after it was proved that they had sabotaged equipment belonging to the Peruvian Telephone Company, and that other persons arrested in connection with the same incident had been released and were still at work but that their case was still being investigated. Finally with respect to CROMOTEX, the Government states that practically the entire staff occupied the premises of the mill and set up a system of defence, arming themselves with explosives. As a result of a clash with the police who were carrying out a judge's order to evict, a Civil Guard captain was killed and several policemen were injured. Five of the occupants were killed and several were arrested. In, its communication of  October , the Government stated that the case brought before the military judges against four workers was about to finish and that the workers judged previously had been reinstated in their jobs or dismissed with compensation.
.In considering the case in November  the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation:(a) asked the Government to supply information as to the present situation of the leaders of the Telephone workers' Union and as to the outcome of the investigations undertaken in respect of certain members of this union following a strike;(b) deplored the seriousness of the incidents which occurred at the CROMOTEX undertaking and which lead to the death of several persons, and requested the Government to indicate whether an inquiry had been initiated to determine responsibilities in respect of these deaths, and, if so, to inform the Committee of its findings;(c) noted that four workers were now undergoing trial and requested the Government to supply the text of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefore.
.In its communication dated  January  the Government states that on the occasion of the Christmas holiday it granted a special pardon and dropped proceedings against persons sentenced or awaiting sentence who had been of good conduct, amongst them the CROMOTEX workers.
.In its communication dated  February  the Government stated that at that date no union leaders of the Telephone Company of Peru were under arrest or facing proceedings as a result of the strike in December .
.The Committee notes with interest the information supplied by the Government with respect to the special pardon extended to the CROMOTEX workers who were undergoing trial before a military judge and the fact that no trade union leaders of the Peruvian Telephone Company are under arrest or facing proceedings as a consequence of the strike in December .
.However, the Committee notes that the Government has not stated whether an investigation to determine responsibilities in connection with the deaths at the CROMOTEX mill has been started. In this connection the Committee recalls that in cases of police intervention to disperse public meetings or demonstrations involving loss of human life it has stressed the great importance it attaches to the circumstances being fully investigated by an immediate an independent special inquiry and to the regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification and responsibility for the police action.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide, having regard to the fact that the persons concerned have peen freed and subject to the principles and considerations expressed in the preceding paragraph, that the case does not call for further information.
.The complaints are contained in communications from the Federation of Employees of the National Telecommunications Company of Peru (FETENTEL) ( September ), the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) ( January ), the world Confederation of Labour (WCL) ( March and  June ), and three workers' delegates to the th Session of the International Labour Conference, supported by the WCL and the Latin American Central of workers (CLAT) ( June ), and in a letter from the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers dated  October . The Government furnished its observations in communications dated  May,  August and  October .
.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations relate, firstly, to matters connected with collective bargaining in the telecommunications sector, and, secondly, to the arrest of workers and members of the Telephone Workers' Union and incidents in certain agricultural areas and in a textile mill, where a number of workers are said to have been killed in a clash between strikers and police.
.With regard to the peasants of Talandracas and Bagua Chica, the Committee notes that, although the complainants have alleged that the incidents reported took place in connection with demands for better working conditions, it has not been established that the events in question have a clear trade union connotation, the complainants having furnished no evidence to that effect. According to the information supplied by the Government, the problems involved related to the occupation of land. In these circumstances the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.The Committee notes that, according to the Government, persons suspected of being implicated in acts of sabotage against the Telephone Company in connection with a strike were arrested but subsequently released and their case is now being investigated. The Government does not specify whether these persons include the officials of the Telephone Workers' Union to whom the complainants have referred. In order to be able to reach its conclusions in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee would like to ask the Government to specify what the present situation is as concerns these officials and supply information as to the outcome of the investigation in question.
.The Committee further notes that a number of persons arrested in connection with incidents at the firm of CROMOTEX have been released. However, certain trade unionists are still under arrest and, according to the complainants, face heavy sentences. The information supplied by the Government confirms the extreme seriousness of the incidents which led to these arrests. On the occasion of a strike involving occupation of the undertaking, a clash between the police and the workers resulted in the death of several workers and one police officer.
.In earlier cases' the Committee has emphasised that the institution by the government concerned of an independent inquiry is a particularly appropriate method of elucidating the facts and determining responsibilities where disturbances have occurred involving the loss of human lives. In the present case, the Committee considers it necessary, before continuing its examination of this aspect of the case, to request the Government to indicate whether such an inquiry has been initiated and, if so, to inform the Committee of its findings. The Committee notes that four workers are now undergoing trial before the military judges and requests the Government to communicate the texts of the judgements to be pronounced and the reasons adduced therefore.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that an agreement has been concluded between the FETENTEL and the National Telecommunications Company, and to decide that the allegations relating to this undertaking do not call for further examination;(b) to ask the Government to supply information as to the present situation of the leaders of the Telephone Workers, Union, and as to the outcome of the investigations undertaken in respect of certain members of this union following a strike;(c) to deplore the seriousness of the incidents which occurred at the CROMOTEX undertaking and which led to the death of several persons, and to request the Government to indicate whether an inquiry has been initiated to determine responsibilities in respect of this death and, if so, to inform the Committee of its findings;(d) to note that four workers are now undergoing trial and to request the Government to supply the texts of the judgements to be handed down and the reasons adduced therefore;(e) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1978,Peru
303,"with the standards of Convention No. , ratified by Peru. The Committee stressed, in particular, the right of workers, if they so desire, to set up more than one union in the same undertaking, and the need to harmonise the provisions of sections  and  of the Presidential Decree, which merely permit the establishment of unions for each undertaking and each occupation, with the provisions of Article  of the Convention and the practice announced by the Government, under which industrial associations may be established, The Committee feels obliged to urge the Government to adopt in the near future the necessary measures to bring its legislation in these respects into conformity with Convention No. , as indicated by the Committee of Experts.
.As regards the allegations relating to the arrest of two leaders of CGTP, the Committee notes the information supplied by the Government, from which it appears that Mr. Huillca was arrested for his part in an offence under common law and brought before the competent judge, and that he has now been released. As regards Mr. Sierra, the Committee observes that he was under arrest for almost two months, apparently without being brought before the courts, for acts of agitation and disturbance of the peace, no further details of which are supplied by the Government. The Committee has observed in a number of earlier cases that the preventive detention of trade unionists may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and that it has always emphasised the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. In this respect the Committee has taken the view that it is one of the fundamental rights of the individual that a detained person should be brought without delay before the appropriate judge and that, in the case of persons engaged in trade union activities, this is one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to guarantee the full effectiveness of the exercise of trade union rights. Subject to these principles, and given the fact that both CGTP officials have been released, the Committee considers that there would be no point in proceeding further with the examination of this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the arrest of two officials of the Peruvian General Confederation of workers, to take note that both have been released and, subject to the principles mentioned in paragraph  above -regarding the right of detained trade unionists to be brought without delay and in all cases before the appropriate judicial authority, to decide that there would be no point in proceeding further with the examination of this aspect of the case;(b) as regards the current legal provisions regarding the establishment and registration of trade unions, to urge the Government to adopt in the near future the necessary measures to bring them into conformity with Convention No. , as indicated by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations;(c) as regards the emergency measures to restrict strikes in the mining and fishery industries, to express the hope, so as to ensure respect for the principles of freedom of association recalled in paragraph , that the possibility of exercising this right legally may be restored in these sectors in the near future;(d) to bring this report to the notice of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.",0,1979,Peru
304,".The complaint appears in a communication from the Peruvian General Confederation of workers (CGTP) dated  June . The Government sent its observations by two communications of  August and  September .
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.CGTP alleges that the Government has passed ""emergency"" legal provisions for the mining, fisheries and other sectors, which have resulted in the taking of measures in violation of trade union rights. It states that many workers have been unlawfully and unjustly dismissed, in particular following the recent miners' strike in the south of the country, that collective agreements have been ignored and the right to organise denied.
.The complainant organisation further considers that the adoption of Act No.  facilitates the dismissal of workers and prejudices freedom of association by establishing a trial period of three years during which workers may not join trade unions. It also alleges that this Act introduces subjective grounds for loss of stability of employment and makes it difficult for trade union organisations to obtain recognition.
.According to CGTP the Ministry of Labour refuses to consider justified trade union petitions, fails to recognise legitimate organisations and, in some cases, such as that of the workers in the paper industry, prevents representative bodies of workers from registering.
.CGTP also alleges that all strikes are declared illegal on the pretext that the labour authorities were not previously aware of the problems which were the subject of the strike notification, or that these problems lie within the competence of the authorities and that the strike is thus ""an unacceptable instrument of coercion"".
.CGTP adds that the Constitutional provision proscribing the arrest of persons without a judicial warrant remains suspended, and that dozens of miners, textile workers, metalworkers and teachers, as well as the members of the CGTP National Council, Pedro Huillca (Vice-President) and Julian Sierra (Organisation Secretary), are under arrest. According to the complaint these persons have been detained for unduly long periods, and no charge has been brought against the teachers' leaders, who have been detained since the beginning of March , or against Julian Sierra, who has been in prison since the end of April. CGTP indicates that the Government has ignored applications for habeas corpus and has refused to give any information on the situation of those under arrest. Lastly, the complainant requests that a representative should be sent to Peru to investigate the facts complained of.
.In its observations the Government stresses the fundamental importance of the mining and fishery industries in the economic crisis through which the country is passing and the need to ensure continuity of production in these sectors. For this purpose two legislative decrees were passed declaring both industries to be in a state of emergency, and empowering undertakings in these industries to break the labour relationship of persons attempting to paralyse them in any illegal manner. The Government states that, since it is not its intention to give employers full licence to order arbitrary dismissals, the legislative decrees stipulate that the illegality of work stoppages is to be determined by presidential resolution (decree of the Executive Power) endorsed by the Minister of Labour and by the Minister of Power and Mines or the Minister of Fisheries as appropriate.
.The Government also states that, in order to satisfy the legitimate expectations of these workers, collective agreements have been negotiated giving them better pay and higher benefits. In addition, given the decrease in purchasing power, legislative decrees have recently been passed to increase the remuneration of all workers and pensioners as well as the minimum wage. The Government supplies copies of these texts.
.According to the Government, in some trade union executives there are groups which have begun to create a climate of social and political chaos with an eye to the forthcoming elections, and which have favoured illegal stoppages in emergency and other sectors; this has obliged the Government to take steps to avoid further harm to the population. The Government states that it respects freedom of association, but that it cannot allow attempts to destabilise it by cliques of sectarian politicians.
.The Government points out that, contrary to the allegations in the complaint, Legislative Decree No.  guarantees stability of employment and full employment, since it lists the specific grounds for terminating a labour relationship and obliges undertakings to fill vacancies due to dismissals, retirement or other reasons within  days.
.The Government also states that it is untrue that the labour authority has refused registration to organisations which have fulfilled the requirements established by law. In this connection it refers to Presidential Decree No.  of , as amended in , which stipulates that before it can be registered a trade union must show that its membership consists of more than  per cent of the manual or non-manual workers, as the case may be, or of both groups if the trade union is a mixed one. It mast also present a list of the names of its members and a copy of its rules and the record of the proceedings of the assembly at which they were approved.
.The Government further states that the right to strike is recognised by the authorities. Restrictions have been placed on its exercise in emergency situations with due regard for national priority interests. The forces of order have intervened to check the excesses of political agitators who have committed offences such as assault, destruction of property, the stoning of public buildings, setting vehicles on fire, etc.
.The Government denies the accusation that arrests have been made without justification. In its opinion, the vagueness of the allegations in speaking, for example, of ""dozens of workers"", etc., shows that an attempt is being made to create a misleading impression and not to present a genuine complaint. It states that Pedro Huillca was detained by officers of the Investigation Police in the city of Cuzco, for his part in a brawl, that he was brought before the examining magistrate on  May , and that he has now been released. Julin Sierra, Organisation Secretary of CGTP, was arrested in Lima on  April  to assist in inquiries regarding his participation in acts of agitation and disturbance of the peace and was released on  June .
.Although the citizens referred to above are trade union representatives, says the Government, the facts on the basis of which they were arrested have nothing to do with their functions as such. The national authorities consider that trade union office does not confer upon its holders immunity from criminal liability, still less so when criminal offences are designed to provoke the public authorities to intervene to re-establish order for the purpose of raising protests which are intended to mislead public opinion and international bodies.
.The Committee observes that the complainant organisation has not presented specific information in support of its allegations regarding the anti-trade union measures said to have been taken in the miring, fishery and other sectors, and regarding interference with the exercise of the right to strike. The Committee wishes to point out that it is only in essential services, in the strict sense of the word, that restrictions or even prohibition of strikes have been admitted by the Committee and expresses the hope that the possibility of exercising this right legally will be restored in the sectors mentioned above in the near future.
.Legislative Decree No. , of  March , to which the complainant also refers, contains provisions on the stability of employment of workers in the private sector. Generally speaking, this right is enjoyed by workers who have been in the service of the same employer for an uninterrupted period of three years, who may be dismissed only for the reasons specified in section  of the Legislative Decree. This section also provides for a system of appeals to the administrative authority and the labour courts in cases of dismissal for any one of the reasons listed. Section  specifies that a collective stoppage of work which complies with the requirements fixed by the legislation shall not be included in the reasons for dismissal related to deliberate reduction of output. Trade union leaders must enjoy stability of employment even when they do not have the length of service indicated above (section ). The Legislative Decree contains no provisions regarding the right of workers to join trade unions. Consequently, the Committee considers that no evidence has been supplied that this Legislative Decree violates freedom of association.
.As regards the allegations referring to the difficulties in the registration of workers' organisations, the Committee remarks that the Government, while rejecting these allegations, refers to the provisions of Presidential Decree No.  of , regarding the Constitution and registration of trade unions. It should be pointed out in this connection in general terms that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has for a number of years remarked that several of these provisions fail to comply",0,1979,Peru
305,".The Committee already examined these cases at several of its sessions, most recently in February , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, observations have been received from the Government in communications dated  April,  May and  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Eight to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The dispute arose in the Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Saul as a result of a collective bargaining disagreement. A strike followed on  March  and the workers occupied the plant. According to the complainants, when the workers had locked themselves in the authorities called in the police to break up the strike who, using firearms and tear gas, set fire to the plant and caused the death of several workers.
.The complainants alleged that the authorities arrested numerous workers, claiming that the trade union leaders were responsible for the fire. Also, in a letter dated  July  the WFTU supplied a list of  trade unionists and  professors who had allegedly been arrested for organising the strike at the Bemis Handal plant.
.The Government replied that the fire was deliberately started by the occupants with the intention of destroying the plant. It stated that the investigation concerning the fire led to the remand in custody of  persons on the order of the criminal judge for the purpose of his inquiry,  of whom were subsequently released on bail. The other persons under investigation were still detained in San Pedro Sula. The Government also confirmed the death of one worker, which it stated had bean caused by a . calibre weapon not used by the police force. It added that a judicial inquiry was under way.
.According to this information, the only persons still held in custody pending trial were Hector Hernndez, Jos A. Espinoza, Rigoberto Gutirrez, Edwin Salmn Caas, Oscar Enamorado and Tofilo Castro.
.At its March  Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and transmit its observations concerning the alleged detention of five trade unionists, namely, Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela and Victor Sabillon, listed in the WFTU's complaint and about whom no information had been supplied by the Government.
.In a telegram of  April , confirmed by a letter of  May , the Government replied that Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela and Victor Sabillon are no longer in prison. Pedro Brizuela, Herminio Deras and Juan Emilio Oliva have been released, no judicial or police procedure having been brought against them for reasons of health, Victor Sabillon Fernndez, a lawyer suspected of intellectual participation in the events, was never detained and has been able to continue his practice.
.The Government explains that the proceedings, because of the voluminous and complex nature of the case, are not yet concluded. It states that the persons still in prison have appointed their lawyers and that the judgement will take place according to law and older the Constitutional safeguards. In a telegram of  September, the Government announced that on  September  Messrs. Hernndez Morales, Salmon Caas, Enamorado, Gutirrez, Vallecillo and Castro have been released.
.With regard to the findings of the inquiry into the death of ore worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that seven persons who had been remanded in custody on the order of the criminal court were released on  September , four have been released on bail, no action has been brought against three and one was not detained and was able to continue his activities. The Committee notes however that Jos A. Espinoza has not yet been released and has not been tried.
.While taking note of the information supplied by the Government, the Committee recalls that trade union leaders were detained without trial since March , and that one of them is still in detection. In this correction, the Committee points out, as it has done on a number of previous occasions, that in all cases in which trade union leaders are held in custody without trial, these measures may involves a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and the Committee has always emphasised the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial on account of tea difficulty of securing evidence is a practice which involves the inherent danger of abuse and is subject to criticism.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(i) as regards the remand in custody since March  of Jos A. Espinoza, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth by the Committee in the previous paragraph, especially the fact that such detention may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights;(ii) as regards the findings of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, as soon as the judgements have been delivered.
.Case No.  was examined by the Committee in May  when it submitted interim conclusions thereon, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session. The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented allegations which were treated in Case No. , and the two cases together were considered by the Committee and further interim conclusions were submitted to the Governing Body which approved them at its th Session. The Government has submitted additional information in a letter dated  December .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in the Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. The WFTU provided a list of trade unionists and professors who had allegedly beau arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.
.In its previous replies, the Government stated that during the incidents on  March , the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handai undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying it. Investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge, and according to the Government's statements no account was taken of their trade union affiliation in the decision of this judge to detain them. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces and stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker. In a later communication the Government stated that two of the persons detained had requested and been granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, along with another detainee.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and to transmit its observations about the WFTU complaint.
.In its letter of  December , the Government indicates that, on  December  two more of the persons detained, Messrs. Adalberto Crdova Turcios and Tmas Nativi, have also been released on bail following medical examinations. The other remaining persons under investigation for the events at the Bemis Handal plant are still detained in San Pedro Sula. Judicial proceedings concerning the eleven persons who had been arrested are still underway.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the release on bail of two persons involved in the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway against the eleven who had been arrested, and to reiterate its request to the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and reasons adduced therefore, when available;(b) to reiterate its request to the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of  trade unionists (namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, and Victor Baillon) listed in the WFTU's complaint and concerning which no information has been supplied;(c) to take note of this interim report.
.Case No.  has been examined by the Committee in May  when it submitted interim conclusions thereon, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session, The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), by letter dated",0,1979,Honduras
306,"of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants refer to events which took place on  March  in the Bemis Handal textile plant in the town of San Pedro Sula. They explain that the workers in that undertaking had submitted petitions of demands to the management and that the latter had reacted in an equivocal manner and finally refused to bargain. Faced with this refusal, the workers went on strike and occupied the plant on  March declaring that they would not leave until the management agreed to negotiate.
.The complainants add that in order to remove the occupiers the authorities acted brutally by having the public security forces intervene as well as the National Department of Investigations who used weapons and tear gas which, according to the ICFTU, caused the burning down of the factory. The WCL and the ICFTU point out that the authorities have tried to attribute the responsibility for the fire to the trade union leaders and their organisations.
.The CLAT and the WCL indicate that the intervention by the authorities brought about, the death of four workers. According to the ICFTU three workers were killed. A large number of workers were wounded and over  were arrested. In noting these events, the ICFTU mentions a statement by the ""Chief of the Homicide Division"" of the National Department of Investigations, according to which an inquiry was under way to discover whether the fire had been caused by people outside the workers' organisation. Moreover, the Vice-Chancellor of the Autonomous National University of Honduras is said to have stated that there could have been a mistake regarding this matter.
.In its communication of  April , the WCL gives a list of  workers, members of the National Peasants' Union, who are said to be detained in various prisons in the country.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that the fire in the Bemis Handal undertaking was no accident. It had been intentionally caused with a view to completely destroying this work centre. The authorities therefore immediately undertook investigations to find the authors of the arson and bring them to trial in order to determine their participation in the matter.
.The Government explains that on  June , when the collective agreement, signed for a duration of three years, had been in force for a year and a half, the workers' union in the Bemis Handal undertaking presented demands to the management for a revision of salaries. On  June , the undertaking responded by pointing out that changes in salaries were provided for in the collective agreement. On  September , the union leadership approached the General Inspection of Labour denouncing the violation of many clauses in the collective agreement. Despite a thorough investigation by the labour inspectors, the existence of the alleged infringements could not be established.
.On  February , representatives of the undertaking and the trade union met at San Pedro Sula in the presence of the Regional Labour Director to discuss the points at issue. According to the Government, there was apparently a willingness to arrive at a long-term agreement. Thus  of the  points raised in the petition were resolved, leaving only one outstanding.
.However, the Government adds, on  March  the union set in motion a work stoppage with occupation of the plant which made any activity impossible. The Regional Labour Director met with the trade union leaders in an effort to resolve the dispute, and then with the legal representative of the undertaking, with whom he discussed the different points at issue. However, all these efforts were in vain since the said government official personally witnessed the acts of violence carried out by the workers, which finally resulted in the fire totally destroying the workplace.
.Police investigations carried out to discover those responsible led to the arrest of  persons suspected of having some responsibility in the fire. Amongst these persons were workers from the factory and from other workplaces, as well as some people arrested on the spot without being able to justify their presence inside the factory. These arrests were carried out in the course of the judicial inquiry on the case and no account was taken of the eventual trade union affiliation of those concerned.
.As the police inquiry and judicial proceedings progressed,  persons were released because there was no reason for prolonging their detention. The  persons still in detention are at the disposal of the criminal judge.
.The Government refers to statements by trade union leaders and organisations on the events in the Bemis Handal undertaking of which one, made by the Authentic Trade Onion Federation of Honduras, of the Christian-Democrat tendency, states that people from outside the trade union movement had penetrated different organisations with a view to creating a climate of insecurity for the workers and, therefore for the people of Honduras.
.Annexed to its letter, the Government communicates several press clippings as well as the Regional Labour Director's report on the events in question.
.In its communications of  and  May , the Government states that when the fire was started in the factory, the latter was entirely under the workers' control since they had shut all the access doors and prevented the labour authorities, the police and the management from entering. Regarding the allegations on the death of four workers, the Government states that during the first inquiries on the spot the body of a male person was discovered, who was identified as a worker in the undertaking and who bore a bullet wound from a . caliber weapon, i.e. a caliber which is never used by the public security forces. These investigations did not allow the discovery of other bodies, nor did they prove the existence of wounded workers. The Government states that the judicial proceedings under way cover both the fire at the factory and the death of the worker in question.
.The Committee notes that the allegations mainly concern the events that took place in March  at the Bemis Handal undertaking. These events took place during a strike action started by the workers which involved occupation of the premises. Then the police force intervened to evacuate the factory and at this point serious incidents broke out which led to the burning down of the factory, the death of a worker and the arrest of  persons.
.The Committee must point out that the information supplied by the complainants and by the Government on the origins of the dispute and the run of events are largely contradictory. According to the complainants, the employer refused to negotiate with the workers and the destruction of the factory was caused by the intervention of the police. On the other hand, according to the Government, the labour dispute was the object of negotiations with the participation of the labour inspection and the fire was brought on by the acts of violence of the workers and of those people foreign to the undertaking who were on the premises.
.Faced with these two contradictory versions, the Committee cannot at this stage come to any conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless, it must express its concern over the seriousness of events that took place after the intervention of the police. The Committee deplores the death of a worker, confirmed by the Government. It notes that the inquiries/ carried out concern the origin of the fire that took place in the factory and the circumstances of the death of the worker. So as to be able to formulate its Conclusions on this aspect of the case, the Committee would like to have at its disposal the results of the inquiry carried out on this death.
.The Committee notes that the judicial proceedings undertaken by the authorities have resulted in the continuing detention of  out of  arrested persons. From the Government's observations it appears that these  persons are going to be tried. The Committee considers that, in the present case, it would be particularly useful for it to have at its disposal information on the outcome of the judicial action undertaken and, in particular, the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefor.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet sent its observations concerning the list of agricultural trade unionists who, according to the WCL, have been detained.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern about the serious events which took place after the intervention of the police at the Bemis Handal undertaking;(b) to request the Government to supply information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker;(c) to note that the  people still detained appear to be subject to trial, to request the Government to supply information on the result of the judicial proceedings undertaken and, in particular, the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefor;(d) to also request the Government to transmit",-1,1979,Honduras
307,"a climate of permanent confrontation between the management and the executive of the union. Pedro Quevedo, the Chairman of the executive, was recently shot down at the wheel of his truck. Shortly afterwards Israel Mrquez Pivaral became General Secretary following trade union elections. He then became the target of attacks by the undertaking. After escaping unharmed from two attempts on his life, he took refuge in the Venezuelan Embassy and later fled to Costa Rica. He was succeeded by Manuel Lpez Baln, whose life was at once threatened on a number of occasions. Finally, Mr. Lpez Baln was killed in the manner described above. Lastly, in a communication of  May , the President of WCL refers, among other things, to the imprisonment since  of Jos Enrique Garcia Castellanos, an official of the union of the Guatemalan Social Security Institute.
.In its communication of  April  the Government stresses that for some years the country has been in the throes of a struggle between clandestine and extremist political groups which foster a climate of violence and terror and threaten the institutions of the State, regardless of the Government's socio-economic development and democratisation programmes. It would appear, said the Government, that the main objective of this struggle was to ""destabilise"" the Government, seize power and set up a totalitarian rgime. It has claimed victims among militants and leaders in both factions. The Government adds that, although most of the state security resources have been used to keep the peace, maintain order and protect the lives and property of citizens, it has so far not been possible to achieve these objectives for a variety of reasons, particularly the lack of economic and technical resources to enable the Government to deal with violence in all its aspects; communist and anti-communist groups are engaged in outright clandestine warfare.
.The Government adds that it does not at present possess the means enabling it to repress and wipe out these groups, which are operating in relative impunity, but trusts that the investigations which are at present being carried out will provide the basis for their dissolution and will enable their members to be brought before the courts.
.As regards the withdrawal of legal personality from ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE, the Government states that these associations did not respect the objectives for which they were set up according to their by-laws: instead of defending occupational interests, they participated actively in sectarian politics and were involved in subversive activities against the Constitutional rgime.
.The Committee has noted the seriousness of certain allegations made by the complainants, who refer in particular to the death or disappearance of trade union officials; other trade unionists are said to have taken refuge in embassies or abroad. These complaints point to a climate of violence, and this is confirmed by the Government, which stresses that it is the result of a struggle between clandestine extremist groups. It adds that this struggle has claimed victims among militants and leaders of both factions.
.This situation can only create an atmosphere of insecurity and uncertainty unfavourable to the free exercise of trade union activities and indeed to the very operation of workers' organisations. In these circumstances, trade union officials carrying on their normal activities of defending the workers' interests may at times have justified fears of attempts on their lives. Moreover, the difficulties thus encountered in the exercise of trade union rights risk sparking off further violence and disenchantment with trade unionism, which can only be harmful to the interests of workers and in the long run to the national community as a whole.
.The Committee has already expressed the view, in earlier cases, that situations of this kind call for firm measures on the part of the authorities. In the present case, it appears from the Government's reply that investigations are being made into the activities of the subversive groups and that their members are to be brought before the courts. The Committee takes note of this information. The allegations presented contain detailed information on the death of Mr. Manuel Lpez Baln, General Secretary of the Union of Workers of the Embotelladora Guatemalteca Company. The Government has not yet replied to this allegation, which was received only recently. The Committee nevertheless wishes to recall at the present stage that, in other cases involving the deaths of trade unionists, it has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated in order to permit a completely objective and independent elucidation of the facts and determination of responsibilities. Nor has the Government replied to the allegations, received shortly before the session of the Committee, concerning the detention since  of Jos Enrique Garcia Castellanos, an official of the union of the Guatemalan Social Security institute.
.As regards the withdrawal of legal personality from three workers' organisations (ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE), the Government states that these organisations participated actively in sectarian politics and were involved in subversive activities. In this respect the Committee has always stressed that trade unions do not enjoy any immunity enabling them to engage with impunity in activities lying outside the competence of trade unions and prejudicial to public order. It has nevertheless urged that, in all cases, measures equivalent to the suspension or dissolution of a workers' organisation should be decided by judicial channels under Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Guatemala, workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority here is, indeed, the risk that such measures, if taken by the administrative authorities, will appear arbitrary. For this reason and in order to guarantee an impartial and objective procedure and the right to defence, such decisions, if necessary, should be taken by a judicial instance enjoying full independence.
.Section  of the Labour Code of Guatemala provides that ""if so required by the ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, the Labour and Social Welfare Tribunals may order the winding up of an industrial association if it is established by the legal proceedings: (a) that the association intervenes in electoral affairs or party politics, that it acts in the service of foreign interests contrary to the interests of Guatemala, that it initiates or promotes religious or racial rivalry, that it carries on activities antagonistic to the democratic system established by the Constitution, that it obeys instructions of an international character contrary to the said system, or that it violates in any other manner the provision laid down in section , in pursuance of which an industrial association is bound to limit its activities to the furthering and defence of economic and social interests common to its members; "" Furthermore, according to section  of the Code legal personality is indispensable for a trade union to become operative.
.In the present case the Committee does not possess precise information as to the type of procedure (judicial or administrative) which led to the withdrawal of legal personality from the three organisations mentioned by the complaints, or on the precise facts which motivated this decision.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to express its concern at the violence carried out against trade unionists and which creates a climate unfavourable to the free exercise of trade union activities and the free operation of organisations;(b) to request the Government to communicate its observations on the allegations relating to the death of the trade unionist Manuel Lpez Baln (indicating in particular whether an inquiry is being made into his death and, if so, the results of the inquiry) and the imprisonment of Jos Enrique Garcia Castellanos;(c) likewise to request the Government to supply precise information on the procedure followed for the withdrawal of legal personality from the ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE organisations and on the precise facts which motivated this decision;(d) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1979,Guatemala

.In its communication of  July  the Government states that it has at all times respected freedom of association and the right of the organisations to carry on their activities in full freedom, provided that they observe the law and refrain from unlawful acts. It states that, between  July  and  June ,  new trade union executives were registered and  appointments of trade union officials approved.
.As regards the murder of the trade unionist Manuel Francisco Lpez Baln, the Government states that an exhaustive inquiry has been made by the national police and the investigations section. The case was brought before the courts, which were informed that the witnesses refused to give evidence to the police or the courts, alleging that they had seen nothing on the day of the murder.
.As regards the withdrawal of legal personality from ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE, the Government explains that, in accordance with the legislation, the procedure followed was an administrative one. These organisations were not trade unions, but associations of employees in the public sector governed by the provisions of the Constitution, the Civil Service Act and the Civil Code and not by those of the Labour Code. Thus it was not necessary for their legal personality to be cancelled under a judicial procedure. This must be done under an administrative procedure.
.As regards the precise facts which motivated the withdrawal of legal personality, the Government refers to section  of the Constitution of the Republic and section  of the Civil Service Act. Under the first of these two provisions the associations formed by government servants may not engage in party politics, and government servants are not permitted to strike. Section  of the Civil Service Act stipulates that civil servants have the right to associate freely for occupational, co-operative, mutual benefit, social or cultural purposes, but that the associations formed by civil servants may not participate in political activities, nor may they strike.
.The Government states that the three organisations mentioned formed the basis of the ""Council of Organisations of Government Servants"", an organisation without legal personality which organised a strike lasting several days throughout the public administration. This action constituted the main reason for the withdrawal of their legal personality. Furthermore, it was found that these associations had direct links with subversive groups engaged in party politics.
.The Committee notes that the present cases comprise three sets of allegations: the murder of a trade unionist, the withdrawal of legal personality from three civil servants' organisations, and the arrest of a trade union leader.
.As regards the murder of Mr. Manuel Francisco Lpez Baln, the Committee notes that an inquiry into this case was carried out by the national police and that it was brought before the courts. However, it was not possible to obtain any evidence regarding the circumstances in which the murder was committed.
.In these circumstances, the Committee can only express once again its concern at the gravity of the allegations made. It must also stress that a genuinely free and independent trade union movement cannot develop in a climate of violence and uncertainty. The Committee expresses the hope that the Government will take all necessary steps to ensure that trade union rights can be exercised in a climate of freedom and security.
.Regarding the withdrawal of legal personality from the three associations of civil servants, the Committee notes that these measures, which were of an administrative nature, were motivated primarily by the organisation of a strike by the associations concerned and by their links with subversive organisations.
.The Committee must recall in this connection that, whatever the reasons adduced for the withdrawal of legal personality from workers, organisations, measures of this kind, when taken by the administrative authorities, are contrary to the principle established in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Guatemala, according to which such organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority. Furthermore, if this principle is to be properly applied, it is not sufficient for the law to grant the right of appeal against such administrative decisions; the latter should not take effect until the expiry of the statutory period for lodging an appeal or until the confirmation of such decisions by a judicial authority.,
.In the present case the information available to the Committee does not enable it to determine whether there is an appeal to the judicial courts against these decisions and, if so, whether the appeal has a suspensive effect. The Committee would like to obtain information on this point in order to enable it to come to definitive conclusions on this aspect of the case.
.Finally, the Committee notes that the observations of the Government on the arrest of Mr. Jose Enrique Garcia Castellanos have not yet been received.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the murder of Mr. Manuel Francisco Lpez Baln, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in paragraph  above and to express the hope that the Government will take all necessary measures to ensure that trade union rights may be exercised in a climate of freedom and security;(b) as regards the withdrawal of legal personality from the organisations ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE:(i) to recall the principle set forth in Article  of Convention. No. , ratified by Guatemala, that workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority;(ii) to request the Government to state whether there is an appeal to the judicial courts against decisions taken by administrative authority and, if so, whether such appeal has a suspensive effect on the decisions;(c) to request the Government to send its observations on the arrest of Mr. Jos Enrique Garcia Castellanos;(d) to take note of the present interim report.
.The complaints of the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) are contained respectively in a telegram of  February  and a letter of  March . WCL sent further information in communications of  April and  May . The Government transmitted its observations in a communication of  April .
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.CLAT alleges that a number of trade unionists have been killed, others have disappeared and still others have taken refuge in embassies. Finally, some are said to have left the country because of repression against the trade union movement: this is apparently the case of Edgar Orellana and Emilio Escobar of the STIOS organisation, Marco Antonio Figueroa of ATRG, and Miguel Albizures and Israel Mrquez of CNT. The allegations of the WCL also refer to the situation of numerous active trade unionists and trade union officials in the country, particularly those just mentioned: according to the complainants, there are disappearances and killings every day. WCL states that extreme right-wing groups, such as the ""secret anti-communist army"" (ESA), murder trade union leaders and spread terror by circulating the list of future victims, which includes Julio Celso de Leon, a member of the executive Committee of CLAT.
.The complaints of both CLAT and WCL also refer to the cancellation by the Government of the registration of the workers' organisations ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE. WCL believes that the Government is preparing a list of other workers' organisations against which similar measures are to be taken, in particular in the teaching, social security and municipal workers' sectors. In addition, all applications for legal personality by workers' organisations have been blocked. Finally, WCL and CLAT request that a commission of inquiry should be sent to the country.
.In its letter of  April  WCL refers to the death of Manuel Lpez Baln , General Secretary of the Trade Union of workers of the ""Embotelladora Guatemalteca, Anexos y Conexos"" Company of the Guatemalan subsidiary of Coca-Cola. On  May , as Mr. Lpez Baln was doing his delivery rounds in zone  of Guatemala City, he was attacked and killed by persons unknown, who fled without being apprehended. According to WCL, the crime was not motivated by robbery, since the murderers did not make the slightest attempt to remove the money from the sales. WCL describes in detail the difficulties encountered in the formation of the above-mentioned trade union owing to the hostility of the management. There was, it adds,",0,1979,Guatemala
309,".The Committee has examined this case twice before, at its May and November  sessions. On each occasion it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body, which requested the Government to supply certain additional information.
.The Government has since sent a communication to the ILO dated  March .
.Guatemala has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The matters still outstanding concern the withdrawal by administrative authority of legal personality from three civil servants' organisations, the ATRG, the ANCEP and the AGAE, and the detention since  of Jos Enrique Garcia Castellanos, an official of the union of the Guatemalan Social Security institute.
.As regards the withdrawal of legal personality from the organisations ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE, the Government explained earlier that these organisations were not trade unions, but associations of employees in the public sector governed by the provisions of the Constitution, the Civil Service Act and the Civil Code and not by those of the Labour Code. Their legal personality had accordingly been withdrawn under an administrative procedure and not a judicial procedure, the grounds for this action being the fact that these organisations had called a strike lasting several days throughout the public administration and the fact that they had direct links with subversive groups.
.No information was supplied with regard to the detention of Mr. Jos Enrique Garcia Castellanos.
.When the case was examined in November  the Governing Body decided, on the Committee's recommendations:(a) as regards the withdrawal of legal personality from the organisations ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE:(i) to recall the principle set forth in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Guatemala, that workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority;(ii) to request the Government to state whether there was an appeal to the judicial courts against decisions taken by administrative authority and, if so, whether such appeal had a suspensive effect on the decisions; and(b) to request the Government to send its observations on the arrest of Pr. Jos Enrique Garcia Castellanos.
.In its communication of  March , the Government states with regard to the official of the union of the Guatemalan Social Security Institute, Jos Enrique Garcia Castellanos, that no charge has been officially filed, but that the national police, having carried out an inquiry of its own accord, has established that this person was not arrested by a member of the government police force. After consulting the lists of persons in custody the Government declares that this person is not in any place of detention.
.As concerns the withdrawal of legal personality from the organisations ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE, the Government states that under the terms of section  of the Administrative Disputes Act, administrative decisions may be revoked, modified or confirmed by the authority making them. They may also be appealed against with a view to their annulment or reversal. Such an appeal must be filed with the public administration authorities by the person or body corporate concerned within three days of being informed of the decision. The Government adds that in the present case the organisations concerned have not exercised their right to appeal.
.As it has done several times in the past with respect to the disappearance of trade union officials in Guatemala, the Committee cannot but deplore once again the climate of insecurity surrounding such disappearances when it is impossible even for light to be thrown on such infringements of human rights and freedom of association. The Committee further wishes to point out, as it has already done in similar cases, that such a climate inevitably represents a serious impediment to the exercise of trade union rights and that such situations call for strict measures on the part of the authorities in order to establish the facts, punish the culprits and restore the situation to normal, this being an essential prerequisite for the free exercise of trade union rights.
.As concerns the withdrawal of legal personality from the three civil servants' organisations, the Committee notes that the Government states that there is an administrative avenue of appeal against administrative decisions, but does not specify whether such appeal has a suspensive effect on the decisions concerned nor whether it allows for reconsideration of the substance of the matters at issue. The Committee accordingly wishes to point out, as it has done in a number of similar cases, that withdrawal of legal personality under such conditions does not ensure the right of defence which judicial procedure alone can guarantee, and that this measure is accordingly inconsistent with the principles of Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ). The Committee would also like to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the disappearance of Jos Enrique Garcia Castellanos, to deplore the climate of insecurity prevailing in the country and to point out that such a climate inevitably represents a serious impediment to the exercise of trade union rights and that such situations call for strict measures on the part of the authorities;(b) as regards the withdrawal of legal personality from the organisations ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE and more generally on the national legislation on the subject;(i) to point out that this measure is inconsistent with the principles laid down in Article  of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. );(ii) to draw the attention of the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to this aspect of the case.
.The Committee has already examined this case, at its May  session, when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body and requested the Government to supply certain information.
.The Government has since sent a communication to the ILO dated  July .
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its complaint of February  CLAT alleged that a number of trade union leaders had been killed, and that others had disappeared or taken refuge in embassies. It also stated that some had left the country because of repression against the trade union movement. CLAT alleged that extreme right-wing groups, such as the ""Secret Anti-Communist Army"" (ESA), murdered trade union leaders and spread terror by circulating the list of future victims.
.In its complaint of April  WCL referred to the death of Manuel Lpez Baln, General Secretary of the Trade Union of Workers of the ""Embotelladora Guatemalteca, Anexos y Conexos"" company of the Guatemalan subsidiary of the Coca-Cola company. On  May , as Mr. Lpez Baln was doing his delivery rounds in Zone  of Guatemala City, he was allegedly attacked and killed by persons unknown, who fled without being apprehended. According to WCL, the crime was not motivated by robbery, since the murderers did not make the slightest attempt to remove the takings. WCL described in detail the difficulties encountered in the formation of the abovementioned trade union owing to the hostility of the management. There was, it added, a climate of permanent confrontation between the management and the executive of the union. In a communication of May  the President of WCL also referred to the imprisonment since  of Jos Enrique Garcia Castellanos, an official of the union of the Guatemalan Social Security Institute.
.Finally, the complaints of both CLAT and WCL also referred to the deregistration by the Government of the workers' organisations ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE.
.In a communication of April  the Government stressed that for some years the country had been in the throes of a struggle between clandestine and extremist political groups which fostered a climate of violence and terror and threatened the institutions of the State, regardless of the Government's socio-economic development and democratisation programmes. According to the Government the main objective of this struggle was to ""destabilise"" the Government, seize power and set up a totalitarian regime. It had claimed victims among militants and leaders in both factions.
.The Government added that it did not at present possess the means enabling it to repress and wipe out these groups, which were operating in relative impunity, but that it trusted that the investigations which were then being carried out would provide the basis for their dissolution and enable their members to be brought before the courts.
.As regards the withdrawal of legal personality from ATRG, ANCEP and AGAE, the Government stated that these associations did not respect the objectives for which they were set up according to their by-laws: instead of defending occupational interests, they participated actively in sectarian politics and were involved in subversive activities against the Constitutional regime.
.At its May-June  session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee:(a) expressed its concern at the",0,1979,Guatemala
310," July , presented further allegations (Case No. ). The Government provided additional information in two letters dated  May  and in letters dated  and  August .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in .he Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula. According to the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the intervention of the police and security forces to break up the workers' strike and their occupation of the plant resulted in the burning down of the plant and the death of several workers. Also according to the complainants, many workers were arrested. For its part, the WCL provided a list of  workers, members of the National Peasants' Union, who were said to be detained in various prisons in the country. The WFTU in its letter of  July  provides a list of  trade unionists and  professors who have been allegedly arrested for organising a strike in Honduras.
.The Government, in its previous replies, stated that during the incidents on  March , the fire was deliberately started in the Bemis Handal undertaking by the occupants with the intention of destroying this work centre. The authorities therefore immediately had undertaken investigations to find the authors of the arson and bring them to trial in order to determine their participation in the matter. These investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge. The Government stated that these arrests were carried out in the course of the judicial inquiry on the case and that no account had been taken of the eventual trade union affiliation of those concerned. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces. It also stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker.
.The Committee noted that in view of the largely contradictory nature of the complainants' allegations and the Government's replies, it could not at that stage come to any conclusions in full knowledge of the facts. Nevertheless, it expressed its concern over the seriousness of the events resulting from the intervention of the police, and deplored the death of a worker, confirmed by the Government. It noted that the inquiries carried out concern the origin of the fire in the factory and the circumstances of the death of the worker, and asked the Government to provide information on the results of these inquiries, the texts of the judgements handed down and the reasons adduced therefore. The Committee also requested the Government to transmit its observations about the  agricultural trade unionists who were allegedly detained.,
.In its letters of  May , the Government indicates that of the  agricultural trade unionists named by the WCL,  had been arrested in connection with the investigation of various offences of attempted murder, robbery or theft, in , and were set free by the courts in April and May  because there was no sufficient reason to continue their detention. Two others, Messrs. Emilio Arguijo Mencias and Eleuterio Nolasco Varela, are still detained by order of the criminal court, charged with theft and damages punishable under the Penal Code; and one, Mr. Genaro Medina Varela, remains detained by order of the judge of Yoro, charged with arson. The judicial proceedings regarding these three persons are continuing in accordance with the penal procedures of the country. The Government indicates that it has no record of the other two persons mentioned by the WCL, Messrs. Asuncin Cruz Miranda and Venancio Ramirez, ever having been held in detention. Attached to one of the letters are statements from various judges confirming the situation of the detainees. The Government adds that agricultural workers in the country enjoy the same rights and guarantees as do other citizens and it stresses that social justice can only be built on a democratic base.
.The Government, in its letters of  and  August , supplies information on the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant. It states that on  March ,  men (whose names are given) were ordered to be held in preventive detention for these offences in accordance with the law. Two of them, Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Calderon, leaders of the Honduras General Central of Workers, appealed against this decision before the Appeal Court which, on  July , confirmed it. However, they requested and were granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, on  July . The Government provides a photocopy of the judicial order setting them free, along with Luis Adolfo Portillo who was involved in the same affair.
.The Government states that the judicial inquiry is continuing as regards the  accused, and that at this stage it cannot supply any information or judicial decisions.
.Regarding the list of  trade unionists and  professors whose detention had been alleged by the WFTU, the Government states that  of them were amongst those detained on  March  for their involvement in the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant. Amongst them are Messrs. Antonio de Jests Hernndez Mendoza and Jorge Rodriguez Caldern who were set free on bail as indicated above.
.In its letter of  August , the Government stresses that there is in Honduras a well-organised, strong and independent trade union movement, led for the most part by people who have acquired much experience in trade union matters. Nevertheless, it points out, some union leaders carry out activities which are punishable under criminal law, and the Government does not accept the notion that their status as trade union leaders excuses them from criminal responsibility. It states that this is the case in the proceedings arising from the events which took place at the Bemis Handal plant.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government.
.Regarding the WCL's allegation that  agricultural trade unionists were detained in various prisons in the country, the Committee notes the Government's statement and supporting information to the effect that these persons were arrested for suspected criminal offences. It also notes that, in support of their allegation, the complainants have presented no information indicating that they had been detained for their trade union activities. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire during the incidents at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statements that  workers were ordered to be held in preventive detention on  March  by the criminal court judge and that  of them were released on bail pending trial. The Committee hopes that the text of the judgements will be provided in due course, as previously requested.
.The Committee also notes that the Government has not provided information on  of the  persons listed in the WFTU's complaint, namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, treasurer of a trade union organisation, Alejandro Vallecillo, trade union delegate and member of a strike Committee, Professor Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, trade union counsellor, and Professor Victor Baillon.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the detention of  agricultural trade unionists:(i) to note that according to the information provided by the Government, these persons were accused of criminal offences and brought before the courts, which released  of them;(ii) also noting that the complainant did not supply particulars in support of its allegation, to decide that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination;(b) as regards the results of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway and request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, when they are available;(c) to request the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of five other trade unionists listed in paragraph  above;(d) to take note of this interim report.",0,1979,Honduras
311,".The Committee already examined these cases at several of its sessions, most recently in February , when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, observations have been received from the Government in communications dated  April,  May and  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Eight to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The dispute arose in the Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Saul as a result of a collective bargaining disagreement. A strike followed on  March  and the workers occupied the plant. According to the complainants, when the workers had locked themselves in the authorities called in the police to break up the strike who, using firearms and tear gas, set fire to the plant and caused the death of several workers.
.The complainants alleged that the authorities arrested numerous workers, claiming that the trade union leaders were responsible for the fire. Also, in a letter dated  July  the WFTU supplied a list of  trade unionists and  professors who had allegedly been arrested for organising the strike at the Bemis Handal plant.
.The Government replied that the fire was deliberately started by the occupants with the intention of destroying the plant. It stated that the investigation concerning the fire led to the remand in custody of  persons on the order of the criminal judge for the purpose of his inquiry,  of whom were subsequently released on bail. The other persons under investigation were still detained in San Pedro Sula. The Government also confirmed the death of one worker, which it stated had bean caused by a . calibre weapon not used by the police force. It added that a judicial inquiry was under way.
.According to this information, the only persons still held in custody pending trial were Hector Hernndez, Jos A. Espinoza, Rigoberto Gutirrez, Edwin Salmn Caas, Oscar Enamorado and Tofilo Castro.
.At its March  Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and transmit its observations concerning the alleged detention of five trade unionists, namely, Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela and Victor Sabillon, listed in the WFTU's complaint and about whom no information had been supplied by the Government.
.In a telegram of  April , confirmed by a letter of  May , the Government replied that Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela and Victor Sabillon are no longer in prison. Pedro Brizuela, Herminio Deras and Juan Emilio Oliva have been released, no judicial or police procedure having been brought against them for reasons of health, Victor Sabillon Fernndez, a lawyer suspected of intellectual participation in the events, was never detained and has been able to continue his practice.
.The Government explains that the proceedings, because of the voluminous and complex nature of the case, are not yet concluded. It states that the persons still in prison have appointed their lawyers and that the judgement will take place according to law and older the Constitutional safeguards. In a telegram of  September, the Government announced that on  September  Messrs. Hernndez Morales, Salmon Caas, Enamorado, Gutirrez, Vallecillo and Castro have been released.
.With regard to the findings of the inquiry into the death of ore worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that seven persons who had been remanded in custody on the order of the criminal court were released on  September , four have been released on bail, no action has been brought against three and one was not detained and was able to continue his activities. The Committee notes however that Jos A. Espinoza has not yet been released and has not been tried.
.While taking note of the information supplied by the Government, the Committee recalls that trade union leaders were detained without trial since March , and that one of them is still in detection. In this correction, the Committee points out, as it has done on a number of previous occasions, that in all cases in which trade union leaders are held in custody without trial, these measures may involves a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights, and the Committee has always emphasised the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial on account of tea difficulty of securing evidence is a practice which involves the inherent danger of abuse and is subject to criticism.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(i) as regards the remand in custody since March  of Jos A. Espinoza, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth by the Committee in the previous paragraph, especially the fact that such detention may involve a serious interference with the exercise of trade union rights;(ii) as regards the findings of the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to request the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and the reasons adduced therefore, as soon as the judgements have been delivered.
.Case No.  was examined by the Committee in May  when it submitted interim conclusions thereon, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session. The World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) presented allegations which were treated in Case No. , and the two cases together were considered by the Committee and further interim conclusions were submitted to the Governing Body which approved them at its th Session. The Government has submitted additional information in a letter dated  December .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations arise, in part, from events which took place on  March  in the Bemis Handal textile plant in San Pedro Sula.

Investigations led to the detention of  persons who remained at the disposal of the criminal judge, and according to the Government's statements no account was taken of their trade union affiliation in the decision of this judge to detain them. The Government confirmed the death of one worker, indicating that he had been shot with a . calibre weapon not used by the public security forces and stated that judicial proceedings were underway into the death of this worker. In a later communication the Government stated that two of the persons detained had requested and been granted medical examinations which resulted in their release on bail, along with another detainee.
.At its November  Session, the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, requested the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and to transmit its observations about the WFTU complaint.
.In its letter of  December , the Government indicates that, on  December  two more of the persons detained, Messrs. Adalberto Crdova Turcios and Tmas Nativi, have also been released on bail following medical examinations. The other remaining persons under investigation for the events at the Bemis Handal plant are still detained in San Pedro Sula. Judicial proceedings concerning the eleven persons who had been arrested are still underway.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note the release on bail of two persons involved in the inquiry into the death of one worker and the fire at the Bemis Handal plant, to note that the criminal proceedings are still underway against the eleven who had been arrested, and to reiterate its request to the Government to provide the texts of the judgements and reasons adduced therefore, when available;(b) to reiterate its request to the Government to transmit its observations about the alleged detention of  trade unionists (namely, Messrs. Juan Emilio Oliva, Alejandro Vallecillo, Herminio Deras, Pedro Brizuela, and Victor Baillon) listed in the WFTU's complaint and concerning which no information has been supplied;(c) to take note of this interim report.

.By communications dated  and  March and  April  respectively, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented allegations of violations of trade union rights in Honduras. The ICFTU supplied additional information in support of its complaint on  April . On its part, the WCL sent a new communication to the ILO on  April . The Government made its observations in communications dated  April and  and  May .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom",0,1979,Honduras
314,"restrictions on collective bargaining
.As regards this aspect of the case the Committee remarks that these restrictions were introduced into the legislation in  and . In this connection the Committee refers to the comments which the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations has made for a number of years regarding the application of Convention No.  by Brazil. The comments refer in particular to sections  (as amended by Legislative Decree No.  of  February ) and  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws and section  of Act No.  of  June . These provisions, as mentioned by the complainants, establish the nullity of any clause of a collective agreement which is in direct or indirect contradiction with the Government's wages policy, and authorise the Government to appeal against judgements of the labour courts, with suspensory effect, in the event that the percentage of wage increase agreed upon exceeds that laid down by the executive. The Committee of Experts considered that these provisions might seriously affect the ""full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation"" mentioned in Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Brazil. Furthermore, the Committee wishes to stress, in connection with Act No.  of  October  respecting the automatic adjustment of wages, as it has already done on many occasions with respect to Brazil and other countries, that if, as part of its stabilisation policy, a government considers that wage rates cannot be settled freely through collective bargaining, such a restriction should be imposed as an exceptional measure and only to the extent that it is necessary, without exceeding a reasonable period, and it should be accompanied by adequate safeguards to protect workers' living standards.
.More specifically, as regards section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, the Committee notes that a Government representative stated at the June  Session of the International Labour Conference that this provision had been removed from the draft Bill mentioned above.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the dismissals which followed the strike in the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo in March :(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraph  above;(ii) to suggest that the Government might intervene with the managements of the undertakings concerned to obtain the reinstatement of workers dismissed only for having taken part in a strike which would conform with the principle that the right to strike is one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations to promote and defend their occupational interests;(b) as regards the death of Mr. Santos Dias da Silva:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraph  above and to note that an inquiry was made into the circumstances of his death and that the case is now before the courts;(ii) to deplore the climate of unrest which led to the violent death of a striking worker and to express the hope that the proceedings instituted before the courts will enable responsibilities to be determined;(iii) to request the Government to keep the Committee informed of the outcome of the judicial proceedings underway;(c) as regards the national trade union legislation and collective bargaining.(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraphs  and  as regards the provisions in the legislation imposing state control over the operation of trade unions and collective bargaining which are incompatible with the principles of freedom of association;(ii) to express the hope that it will be possible to take measures for the final adoption of the draft Bill for the revision of the Consolidation of Labour Laws in order to bring the legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association;(d) more generally, to note that new complaints have been received regarding events which took place in the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo in April and May  which will be examined by the Committee at its next session.
.In communications dated respectively ,  and  March and  April , the National Labour Front (FNT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) and the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), presented complaints of violation of trade union rights in Brazil. WCL sent additional information in support of its complaint on  May . In the same communication it transmitted documentation sent to it by the National Labour Front and stated that it supported the complaint of that Organisation. The Government, for its part, sent its observations in a letter of  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints of FNT, WFTU and CLAT, which were sent to the ILO by telegram, refer to the government decision to place under control the trade unions of the metallurgical and engineering industries of the State of Sao Paulo following a strike to obtain higher wages. CLAT also refers to dismissals affecting  workers.
.In its letter of  March  WCL states that during collective bargaining in the metallurgical sector in Sao Bernardo do Campo, Santo Andr and Sao Caetano (all in the Sao Paulo industrial area), the employers' representatives refused to grant a  per cent wage increase which, according to WCL, was merely an adjustment to make good the loss of purchasing power.
.Following this refusal votes were taken in workers' assemblies - certain of which were attended by over , persons - and it was decided to call a strike of unlimited duration beginning  March . The Government declared this move to be unlawful under legislation which, according to WCL, virtually denies the right to strike. Furthermore, continues the complainant organisation, although the strike spread to other major industrial centres of the State of Sao Paulo, such as Jundiai and Sao Jos dos Campos, the Government decided to place all the metalworkers' unions of Sao Bernardo do Campo, Santo Andr and Sao Caetano under control.
.WCL attaches to its letter of  May  a communication dated  April  addressed to the ILO by the National Labour Front and supported by the dismissed officials of the metalworkers unions of Sao Bernardo do Campo, Diadema and Santo Andr, the Metalworkers' Union of Sao Paulo, the Union of Workers in the Metallurgical Industries of Osasco and  other Brazilian workers' organisations in various sectors of activity.
.The documents annexed to the communication of ENT indicate that there are certain weaknesses in the Brazilian legislation. Firstly, it does not provide for effective sanctions against undertakings which do not respect the law. Secondly, it establishes strict supervision of unions by the Ministry of Labour by allowing the Minister or his regional delegates to intervene in any organisation on any pretext whatsoever. Thirdly, the right to strike of workers is non-existent. Finally, as from , severance pay for older workers and stability of employment have been seriously affected by the creation of the ""length of service guarantee fund"", in that the guarantee of employment for trade union leaders is only temporary and that severance pay has been reduced without just cause.
.The ENT documentation also points out that, despite the provisions of section  of the consolidation of Labour Laws, under which employers do not have the right to refuse to bargain, they systematically attempt to evade their obligations when serious matters are to be discussed. Moreover, when problems arising out of collective agreements are brought before the labour courts, these do not examine the questions raised or confine themselves to applying the wage increases decided by the executive.
.As regards the labour dispute to which the complaints refer, it is stated that the trade unions in which the Ministry of Labour has intervened are geographically based in the seven centres of Greater Sao Paulo, where the automobile industry is concentrated.
.The document also states that a survey had been carried out by the Inter-Union Department of Socio-economic Studies and Statistics, a body set up by the unions. This survey had established that, in order to ensure the maintenance of the workers' purchasing powers, wages should be increased by . per cent. In order to obtain this compensation certain trade unions made unsuccessful appeals to the courts and others, including those mentioned in the complaints, exerted pressure from the rank and file, with or without strikes, and thus obtained partial payment of the . per cent increase by direct agreement with the employers or their organisations. Thus, in May and July , the Union of Workers in the Metallurgical, Engineering and Electrical Equipment Industries of Sao Bernardo do Campo and Diadema and the Union of Machinery Industries of the State of Sao Paulo concluded agreements for an  per cent increase which was to be permanently incorporated into the wage and which might not be deducted from future adjustments.
.In February  further negotiations took place.",0,1979,Brazil
315,".The Committee examined this case earlier, at its November  Session when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Since then, the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF) sent a telegram to the ILO on  November . For its part, the Government sent observations in communications dated  January,  February and  March .
.The complaints presented in the present case mainly concern a strike called by the metalworkers' unions of the Sao Paulo region in March . New complaints have been received recently regarding the events which took place in April and May  in the same sector (Case No. ). These complaints have been sent to the Government for its observations and the Committee intends to examine this case at its next session.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The dispute which took place in the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo in March  originated in a disagreement which arose during collective bargaining. It would appear that an earlier wage adjustment had been deducted from wage increases granted during negotiations in . After the strike began the dispute was taken to the labour court, which gave a decision granting a wage increase limited to that authorised by the Government and declared the strike illegal under the legislative provisions regulating the right to strike. The strike nevertheless continued, and the unions which had organised it were placed under control and their leaders suspended. Although they had been removed from office, the leaders accepted a -day truce and an agreement in the hope of finding an amicable solution to the dispute, on the understanding that no striker would be dismissed. Despite the agreement, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) mentioned the dismissal of  workers.
.WCL also stated that Brazilian legislation contained provisions which denied freedom of expression and association and the effective recognition of the right to bargain. According to WCL, the trade unions were subject to state control as regards the drafting of their rules, the election or removal from office of their officials, their financial management, trade union meetings and their programmes of action (prohibition of action contrary to the financial policy of the Government). In addition, WCL considered that there was ample proof of repeated violations of Convention No. , which Brazil had ratified. Thus, section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws permitted the suspension of any provision of a collective agreement which was in direct or indirect contradiction of the Government's wages policy. Furthermore, section  of Act No.  authorised the Government to appeal against judgements of the labour court, with suspensory effect, in the event that the percentage of wage increase agreed upon exceeded that laid down by the executive.
.At its November  Session, on the recommendation of the Committee, the Governing Body, referring to the Brazilian legislation respecting the right to strike, stressed that the conditions that must be fulfilled in order to render a strike lawful must not be such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organisations. The Governing Body also requested the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the dismissals of workers following the strike, and on the general allegations concerning the legislative provisions relating to the control exercised by the authorities on the operation of trade unions and restrictions on the right to bargain collectively.
.The Committee observes that the questions raised in the present case deal with three sets of allegations: dismissals of workers following the strike in the Sao Paulo metallurgical sector; the death of a trade unionist during clashes with the police; and the restrictive provisions of Brazilian legislation as regards freedom of association and collective bargaining.(a) Dismissals of workers
.In connection with the dismissals, the Committee must note that there is a substantial divergence between the version of the events given by the Government and that given by the complainants. It appears, however, from the information available that at least some of these dismissals followed prosecutions in connection with the strike, which had been declared illegal by the labour court. The Committee notes that the Government has stated in this connection that strike pickets used violence to prevent workers from entering the workplace and that a number of undertakings took advantage of the fact that the strike had been declared illegal to dismiss an unspecified number of workers. The Committee has also noted the details given by the Government following inquiries made at its request, from which it would appear that only four workers had been dismissed because of the strike. The Committee nevertheless recalls that the complainants allege that there had been a wave of collective dismissals affecting about  workers.
.The Committee is not in possession of sufficient information to enable it to formulate a precise opinion on the extent of the wave of dismissals. It nevertheless recalls that in earlier cases, where it has examined allegations of dismissals following strikes, it has considered that such measures involve serious risk of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association. It has held the view that, on such occasions, the development of labour relations could be impaired as the result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action. Consequently, and whatever the extent of the dismissals, it would seem desirable for the Government, in a spirit of reconciliation, to intervene with the managements of the undertakings concerned to obtain the reinstatement of the dismissed workers, in view of the fact that the strike must remain one of the essential means available to workers to enable them to press their claims.(b) Death of a trade unionist
.As concerns this aspect of the case, the Committee recalls that in earlier cases it has considered that the intervention by security forces in strike activities should be limited to the maintenance of public order. It notes that an inquiry was made into the circumstances of this death and that the case came before the courts. The Committee can only deplore the climate of unrest which led to the violent death of a striking worker, and expresses the hope that the legal proceedings which have been instituted will enable responsibilities to be determined. The Committee would like to be kept informed of the results of the judicial proceedings underway.(c) Allegations relating to trade union legislation
.As regards state control of trade union operation, the Committee observes that Legislative Decree No.  of  respecting the Consolidation of Labour Laws, as amended, is highly interventionist in character. There is a requirement that the rules of trade unions must contain a statement that the union will act as a body for co-operation with the public authorities for the subordination of economic and occupational interests to the interests of the State (section ); the election of trade union officials is subject to the approval of the Minister of Labour (section ); the Minister issues instructions governing the electoral procedure (section , subsection ). the Minister may also, in the event of a dispute or any occurrence which disturbs the operation of an industrial association, intervene through a representative with powers to manage the association temporarily (section , and section , note , as amended by Act No.  of  June ); the property and income of an industrial association may not be transferred except with the authorisation of the Minister (section , sole subsection); finally, the programme of action implies the subordination of the economic and occupational interests of the trade unions to the interests of the State (section , subsection (c)).
.The Committee notes that the Government refers in its observations to the need to revise certain provisions, but that the only amendments that may be expected relate to matters of detail in this connection the Committee remarks that the draft Bill for the revision of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, published in the Official Gazette of  May , no longer appears to assign trade unions the specific role of a body for co-operation with the public authorities in the sense of subordinating their interests to the interests of the State. The Committee recalls, as it has done in other circumstances, that legislation which imposes a strict control by the State over the drawing up of rules, the election and removal from office of trade union officials, financial management and programmes of action is incompatible with the principles of freedom of association, according to which workers' organisations should have the right to organise their administration and activities without any interference on the part of the public authorities which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee accordingly hopes that it will be possible to take other measures, before the draft Bill is finally adopted, to bring the legislation into conformity with the principles of freedom of association.(d) Allegations relating to",0,1979,Brazil
316,"An agreement was signed by  unions represented by the Metalworkers' Federation of the State of Sao Paulo, who received wage increases of from - per cent, although the increases established by the Government were  per cent. Nevertheless, the  per cent increase agreed on in  had been deducted from the adjustment, and three metalworkers' unions of Santo Andr, Sao Bernardo and Sao Caetano therefore decided to continue the strike which they had begun on  March . After persistent failure to reach an agreement, the dispute was brought before the labour court on  March , and it gave a judgement in less than  hours. By a decision which was not taken unanimously, the court granted a  per cent increase, the amount authorised by the executive, but less than that granted under the collective agreement signed by the  unions of the Metalworkers' Federation of Sao Paulo. Furthermore, the court declared the strike to be illegal.
.As a result of this failure, the workers decided to continue the strike. The Minister of Labour then went to Sao Paulo, where he tried in vain for several days to reconcile the parties. This led to the placing under control of the trade unions, the suspension of their leaders and the appointment of officials of the Ministry of Labour to head the trade union organisations on  March .
.However, the workers continued to meet in the town hall of Sao Bernardo and in churches. When contacted by the parties, the National Synod of Brazilian Bishops enabled the resumption of the interrupted dialogue between the Government, the employers and the workers. The dismissed officials of the unions of Santo Andr, Sao Bernardo and Sao Caetano then accepted a -day truce and the extension of the agreement signed by the  unions of the Metalworkers' Federation of Sao Paulo, in the hope of finding an amicable solution to the dispute and the problem of payment for the time the workers were on strike. It was also understood that no striker would be dismissed. Accordingly, the strike ended on  March .
.The Minister of Labour then said that the control of the trade unions might be ended in the near future and that the leaders who had been removed from office would be authorised to resume leadership of the trade unions. Subsequently, however, the Minister is said to have contradicted this statement. Finally, the document mentions the dismissal of about , workers despite the agreement reached on this point.
.The judgement of the Regional Labour Court of the Second Region which declared the strike to be illegal, and which is included in the documents supplied by ENT, refers to Act No.  of  June , to regulate the right to strike. Under section  of this Act ""the exercise of the right to strike shall be based on a decision adopted by secret ballot by a majority vote of the general meeting of the industrial association representing the occupational category concerned, two-thirds of the members of the industrial association being present (in the case of a first convocation of the meeting) or one-third of the members (where the general meeting is convoked for the second time)"". Furthermore, section  of the Act provides that every general meeting shall be convoked by the managing Committee of the industrial association concerned by notices published ten days beforehand in the local newspapers of the place where the industrial association is situated. The court did not find any evidence in the file that these formalities were respected and accordingly considered that the strike was illegal.
.In its covering letter to the communication from ENT, WCL declares that Brazilian legislation contains provisions which deny freedom of expression and association and the effective recognition of the right to bargain. According to WCL the labour legislation defines the trade union as a body for co-operation with the public authorities, which is subject to state control as regards the drafting of its rules, the election or removal from office of officials, its financial management, trade union meetings and its programme of action (prohibition of action contrary to the financial policy of the Government).
.In addition, WCL considers that there is ample proof of repeated violations of Convention No. , which Brazil has ratified. Thus, section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws permits the suspension of any provision of a collective agreement which is in direct or indirect contradiction with the government's wages policy. Furthermore, section  of Act No.  authorises the Government to appeal against judgements of the labour court, with suspensory effect, in the event that the percentage of wage increase agreed upon exceeds that laid down by the executive.
.WCL also refers to Act No.  of  September , to establish a length of service guarantee fund which, it says, gives the employer unlimited power to dismiss a worker even if there are no grounds to justify the dismissal. Thus, concludes WCL, the whole system of workers' protection is rendered inoperative.
.In its reply the Government first states that the placing under control of the unions mentioned in the complaints is based on the legislation which has been in force since , the purpose of which is to guarantee the authority of a judicial body.
.The Government states that the Regional Labour Court declared the strike illegal solely because the unions concerned did not respect the formalities prescribed by Act No.  to regulate the right to strike, as provided in section  of the Federal Constitution in fact, continues the Government, the unions called the strike without respecting the period of advance notice or convening general meetings as provided for under the legislation. In addition, Act No.  prescribes that the vote-counting by the returning officers shall be presided over by a member of the legal service for labour matters (public prosecutor's department), and that the decision taken shall be notified to the local body of the Ministry of Labour. According to the Government none of these procedures was followed in the present case, and the legal counsel for the trade unions were unable to produce the records of the meetings as required by law. The court therefore declared the strike to be illegal.
.The Government states that the trade unions should then have complied with the judgement and should have decided to return to work, although it was open to them to lodge an appeal with the Higher Labour Court. However, they announced that they opposed the judgement and incited the workers to continue the strike. This attitude led the competent authority, namely the Minister of Labour, to decide to place the organisations under control in accordance with section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws. This decision was preceded by appeals to the organisations concerned from the labour authorities requesting them to respect the legal order.
.As the officials of the organisations failed to appreciate the reasons why they should respect the court's decision and abandoned purely trade union objectives in flagrant violation of the law, the only course of action was that laid down by section , subsection , and section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, namely the removal of trade union leaders from office. The Government also remarks that the decisions of the judiciary must be respected by the community and that trade unions must respect the law of the land, as stipulated by Article  of Convention No. .
.The Government next refers to the principle expressed by the Committee in earlier cases, namely, that prohibition of strikes in the event of a legal dispute does not constitute violation of freedom of association. It also states that the report submitted to the international Labour Conference on the occasion of the adoption of Convention No.  stated that Article  of the Convention should not be interpreted in such a way as to jeopardise the independence and authority of the courts. In the Government's opinion this is precisely what the trade unions have done in the present case.
.In a note attached to its communication the Government mentions that, by Order of  May , the Ministry of Labour has suspended the control of the three trade unions, thus putting an end to the suspension of their leaders. The Government says that this is because they have changed their earlier stand and have taken concrete steps for the application of the decision o-f the Regional Labour Court. Respect for the judicial decision thus having been re-established and the independence and authority of the court reaffirmed, the executive was able to put an end to the control of the trade unions and reinstate their leaders. The Government remarks that these leaders brought no judicial action when they were removed from office, although Brazilian law provides for a special right of appeal against acts of the authorities which are considered to violate the rights of the individual.
.The Committee notes that the complaints made in the present case contain five types of allegations: the decision as to the illegality of",0,1979,Brazil
317,".The Workers' Trade Union of Cano Isaza and Co. Graphic Arts ""El Spectador"" presented a complaint for violation of trade union rights in Colombia in a communication dated  December . It sent additional information in support of its complaint in a communication dated  January . The Government has since sent its observations in a communication of  April .
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisation refers to dismissals of trade union leaders and militants by the printing company Cano Isaza and Co. and wishes to cancel a collective accord which governs the labour relations between non-unionised workers and the undertaking.
.The dispute allegedly began over technical modifications to the newspaper and periodicals production process which resulted in an increase in the responsibility and length of work.
.On  December , the workers requested a meeting with the management with a view to obtaining better working conditions, and believing this was going to take place, they went to the undertaking's amphitheatre to voice their claims. The management then called on the Minister of Labour to have it noted through an inspector that the workers had left their posts. The management is also alleged to have consequently called a three days' lock-out.
.In an effort to weaken trade union resistance within the undertaking, in June  the management is said to have dismissed three leaders of the National Press Association and to have pressured militant trade unionists to incite them to resign from the trade union by giving special bonuses to non-trade unionists. The management is also said to have fired the  trade unionists who refused to leave the trade union.
.In addition, the complainants allege that the management tried to impose on the workers a collective accord which aimed at terminating the trade union freedoms granted by law within the undertaking, particularly the rights to join together, to claim one's rights and to request wage increases. It allegedly threatened to dismiss these who refused to sign and offered special bonuses to others.
.The complainants state that on  November , the workers were informed that the collective accord proposed by the management had been signed by two journalists and a photographer representing the  non-unionised workers of the undertaking. On the same day, the trade union denounced the collective agreement in force and direct negotiation was entered into with the management over a log of claims containing  points prepared by a general assembly of the workers. On  January , the management refused to allow these claims. In the meantime, on  November , the complainants brought an appeal against the deposition of the accord which, in their opinion, had been passed in violation of legal standards.
.The Government explains that the work stoppage on  December  had been illegal as was stated by a labour inspector in the course of a regular visit. The management dismissed several workers who had participated in the work stoppage after the Labour Ministry had authorised this action as conforming with the law. The Government points out that protection of trade union leaders only applies when they carry out their functions legally and not when they direct a work stoppage which has been declared illegal by the Ministry. However, those involved have the possibility of appealing in a contentious-administrative process for the cancellation of the administrative resolution adopted by the Labour Ministry.
.As for the second point, according to the Government, that the head of the Division for Collective Labour Relations legitimately accepted the deposition of the collective accord between the Cano Isaza and Co. undertaking and its non-unionised workers on  November . In fact, this accord had been adopted in conformity with the provisions of section , and following, of Decree No.  of  which regulates this. A general assembly of non.-unionised workers was held on  October , and on  October  a new assembly elected the negotiators who were recognised as having the right to sign the accord which was the outcome of the log of claims. The Government states that on  November  the undertaking had  workers of whom  were members of the Asoprensa Union and  belonged to the first-degree union. Moreover,  workers adhered to the collective accord applying section  of the Labour Code. The Government points out that the appeal brought by the president of the union against the deposition of the accord has not been heard and that the matter is before the Director General of Labour in conformity with the administrative procedure in force. The Government states that section  of Decree No.  provides that undertakings which have signed agreements with trade unions representing more than a third of the workers may not sign a collective accord. This implies, on the other hand, that if the union represents less than one third of the workers, it is possible for the undertaking to enter into the collective accord with non-unionised workers.
.This case essentially concerns the alleged dismissal of trade union leaders and militants and an appeal for cancellation of a collective accord, signed by the management and the non-unionised workers of the Cano Isaza and Co. undertaking, brought by the complainant organisation.(a) Allegations relating to the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants
.It appears from the information available that, as concerns the dismissal of three trade union leaders and militants, the version of the complainants and that of the Government are totally contradictory. Nevertheless, the Committee notes that those concerned were dismissed, according to the Government, for having participated in a half day's work stoppage which had been declared illegal by the authorities, although the complainants deny that such action took place. The Committee wishes to point out, as it has done in previous cases relating to Colombia,& that general labour relations could be greatly improved if the employers concerned gave serious consideration to the possibility of reinstating the persons affected. On the other hand, the Committee has already drawn the attention of the Government to the risks of abuse and threats to freedom of association involved in dismissals arising out of strikes and expressed the view that the adoption of an inflexible attitude in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who had participated in a strike could impair the development of labour relations. In the present case, the Committee notes that even if the authorities had observed a work stoppage, it only lasted for half a day. The Committee accordingly considers that it would be appropriate for the Government to take measures with a view to aiding the re-establishment of the dismissed workers.(b) The collective accord
.The Committee has already examined the provisions governing the question of collective accords on two previous occasions. These agreements govern the labour relations between the undertaking and its nor.-unionised workers.
.The Committee has recalled that Article  of Convention No.  (ratified by Colombia) invites governments to take appropriate measures to ""encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements"". Recommendation (No. ) concerning Collective Agreements, , in section  defines the term collective agreements to mean an agreement concluded between employers and representative workers' organisations or ""in the absence of such organisations, the representatives of the workers duly elected and authorised by them"". The Committee has observed that these standards give preference, as far as one of the parties to the collective bargaining is concerned, to workers' organisations. Recommendation No.  mentions non-organised workers' representatives only in the absence of such organisations.
.The Committee considered that direct bargaining carried out between the undertaking and its personnel, not taking account of existing representative organisations, could, in certain cases, be contrary to the principle that collective bargaining between employers and workers' organisations must be encouraged.
.In the present case,-the Committee notes the documentation attached to the complainants' communication from which it appears that employer pressure may have been exerted on the workers to force them to resign from the union and sign the collective accord. The accord contained inducements, in particular the grant of bonuses to those who signed before  November  (sections  and ), and a circular distributed by the management later gave the same bonuses with retroactive effect to those who signed before  December. In addition, those who adhered to it could not retire without the approval of the undertaking (section ) and the signatories could neither present collective petitions to the management, nor engage in collective disputes, nor benefit from agreements signed by the undertaking and its trade unions such as they are in force (section ).
.The Committee notes that discriminatory methods used by the employer to force signature of the accord seems to conflict with section  of Legislative Decree No.  of  according to",0,1979,Colombia
318,".The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) appears in a communication of  August . The Government replied by a letter of  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.WCL states that a ""Drivers' Combat Unit"", consisting of transport workers, requested the Government to countermand the increase in petrol prices, which rose from $. to $. on  July . On  August, after all conciliation procedures had been exhausted, a strike was called, paralysing the transport system in the major towns of the country. The strikers were supported, continues the complainant, by thousands of workers at a solidarity demonstration in Santo Domingo, but the police and groups of armed civilians opened fire on the workers, killing  persons and injuring ;  persons are said to have been arrested.
.The Government replies that, owing to the increases in the price of petroleum, which have affected the economies of all non-producer countries, particularly developing countries like the Dominican Republic, it was forced to raise the price of petrol and petroleum derivatives, as has been done in all countries. These price increases were unpopular with the national drivers' organisations, it adds, and provoked reactions which showed little understanding of the economic situation of the country. The Government had nevertheless adopted compensation measures in favour of the drivers, including social security measures, a monthly wage of  pesos, and housing plans, etc.
.The Drivers' Combat Unity Committee, continues the Government, unexpectedly called a strike of public transport workers, demanding that the Government take a series of measures, most of which were unconnected with trade union objectives; on the contrary, they represented the programme of a political party. The Government also states that strikes of this kind are expressly forbidden by sections  and  of the Labour Code, and that the transport of passengers and goods is regarded as a public service which must remain uninterrupted.
.At no time, continues the Government, was there a demonstration of the kind described it the complaint, but the strike which had been so unexpectedly called was characterised by organised violence, particularly in Santo Domingo. There were also lightning commando strikes by groups unconnected with the transport sector, who overturned and burned vehicles and disappeared into the suburbs of the towns when the forces of order appeared. It may therefore be presumed, considers the Government, that the protest against the increase in the price of petrol was merely a cover-up for activities to destabilise the present regime and upset the process for granting broad guarantees in the field of human rights.
.According to the Government, the civilian groups were responsible for the shootings, which resulted in three deaths and a number of injuries; these were, however, isolated incidents in which the forces of order and the public authorities did not participate in any way. The Government suspects that these acts were part of the above-mentioned destabilisation plan. Nobody from the transport sector in general was being held in the prisons of the country, adds the Government, and nobody from the Drivers' Combat Unity Committee; although the forces of order apprehended certain persons as they were committing acts of vandalism, these persons were not connected with any occupational organisation.
.The Committee has already pointed out, in examining earlier cases concerning the Dominican Republic, that the right to strike is ore of the essential means by which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. This consideration applies, however, only in so far as strikes are conducted peaceably, without violence or attacks on persons or property and, above all, without degenerating into riots. In the present case, the strike was accompanied by serious incidents, ending in the deaths of a number of persons. According to the Government, groups of civilians were responsible for the killings. The Committee can only express its concern at these incidents. In many cases involving the loss of lives of trade unionists the Committee has stressed the reed to carry out a full and impartial inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and determine responsibilities. In the present case, however, no details have been supplied of the identity or the trade union membership of the victims.
.The Committee also notes the Government's statement that no transport worker, in particular no member of the Drivers' Combat Unity Committee or an occupational organisation, was among the persons apprehended while committing acts of vandalism.
.Finally, the Committee notes that section  of the Labour Code includes transport among the sectors in which strikes are forbidden. In the cases relating to the Dominican Republic mentioned earlier, the Committee stressed that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike were compatible with the principles of freedom of association only under certain conditions (in particular the existence of adequate, impartial and speedy conciliation and arbitration procedures) and provided that the services were essential in the strict sense of the term. The Committee considers that transport does not generally fall within this category, namely services whose interruption would endanger the existence or well-being of the whole or part of the population.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to deplore the seriousness of the incidents (especially the loss of human lives) which occurred on the occasion of the strike of transport workers and to stress the importance of conducting a full and impartial inquiry in such cases;(b) to take note of the Government's statement that no transport worker and no member of an occupational organisation was among those arrested;(c) generally to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that restrictions or prohibitions on the right to strike in essential services are not compatible with the principles of freedom of association, save in the case of services which are essential in the strict sense of the term and only under certain conditions and guarantees.",0,1979,Dominican Republic
319,".By a communication dated  October , the Staff Association of the World Health Organisation (WHO) at Geneva presented a claim against the Government of Argentina based on article  of the ILO Constitution alleging violation of the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ), both of which have been ratified by Argentina.
.The Committee proceeded to a preliminary examination of these allegations on the basis of decisions previously taken by the Governing Body in similar situations where a communication submitted under article  of the Constitution had concerned, in the complainant's opinion, freedom of association questions.
.The Association mentioned above states that Miss Viviana Ercilia Micucci, an Argentine citizen and international official working for a subsidiary body of the Panamerican Health Organisation (which is a regional organisation of WHO), was abducted on  November . The complainant states that as she was a member of the staff, she was automatically a member of a staff association, an association with which the management had consultations on such matters as a compensation scale. Miss Micucci was a member of a joint staff/management subcommittee engaged in a salary survey within the United Nations common system. It is understood, says the complainant, that material on this survey has also disappeared. According to the complainant, there is a reason to suppose that the abduction has resulted from her activity as a staff representative and that the Government of Argentina has failed to protect her rights under the Conventions mentioned above.
.The Committee has undertaken a preliminary examination of the nature of the allegations made, to the exclusion of any other question which this communication could raise. It notes, in particular, that Miss Micucci does not appear to have been appointed as a trade union officer by the staff, but that she was ""automatically"" a member of the staff association, as an official in the international organisation concerned. In addition, the complainant does not establish a prima facie case that the abduction - by persons unknown - was linked in some way to activities of a trade union nature. It merely points out that Miss Micucci was a member of a joint subcommittee engaged in a salary survey concerning international officials and that documents concerning this survey are also understood to have disappeared. The Committee is of the opinion that the elements submitted do not establish an apparent link between the events described in the complaint and the obligations arising for the State concerned from Conventions Nos.  and . It considers that the complainant has not produced any facts which tend to prove that Argentina, in the case at hand, has failed to secure the effective observance - in the terms of article , paragraph  of the Standing Orders relating to the procedure to be followed in the case of representations under article  of the Constitution of the ILO - of the instruments mentioned above. On the other hand the Committee has learned that steps have been taken by the Secretariat of the United Nations regarding the situation of this international official.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body, for the reasons set out in the preceding paragraph, to dismiss this communication without transmitting it to the Government concerned.",0,1979,Argentina

At the end of , several people were reportedly killed, including the agricultural union leader of the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CSTC), Pedro Pablo Bello. According to the complainants, the severe repression that is exercised in the rural areas has spread to the urban sector; the headquarters of the CSTC has reportedly been attacked by paramilitary groups, radio and television networks are said to be censored and a Decree of  January  has suspended the right to lodge a plea of habeas corpus.
.According to the FENALTRASE in its communication of  February , the Security Statute, which describes any grievance connected with labour as subversive, has led to the organisation by the army and secret services veritable campaigns against the peasants and, in some cases, has resulted in the death of union leaders. In Bogot, specifically, many people including a large number of workers have been arrested and their homes raided on the grounds of offences against law and order. According to the FENALTRASE, this repression is intended to prevent the workers' grievances from obtaining a proper hearing.
.The WCL takes up these various points in its communication of  February. In a letter dated  March, the UISTM states that the Security Statute, which is supposed to ""combat insecurity"", is directed more than anything against the workers. Section  of the Security Statute provides for prison sentences of from  to  years for ""persons guilty of disturbing law and order or hampering the peaceful conduct of social activities"". The Statute also empowers the armed forces and police to condemn civilians without appeal. Furthermore, the radio and television networks are allegedly censored to prevent them from broadcasting information relating to law and order, suspensions and stoppages of work and illegal strikes.
.According to the UISTM, on  September  - following the entry into force of the Security Statute - workers were arrested by the police and state secret service agents. These workers, who were employed in the Incametal metalworking enterprise in Medellin, were holding a strike in order to obtain the negotiation of a collective agreement. In Bogot, the workers of Productos Metlicos Promel, a Chrysler subsidiary, were striking for better pay. Citing the provisions of the decree mentioned above, the authorities prohibited these workers from holding any meetings and confiscated all written propaganda connected with the strike. The UISTM also refers to the arrest of several trade unionists and to the ill-treatment to which they are said to have been subjected.
.According to the complainants, Pedro Pablo Bello, a CSTC union official in the agricultural sector, met his death in the course of repressive action against the peasants which was stepped up following the adoption of the Security Statute. The complainants also referred to the death of Arelino Ul, an indigenous governor, Manuel Martinez Quiraz, a lawyer, and four farmers.
.Several other trade union leaders are said to have been arrested in Bogot and to be held by the military Institutes Brigade. According to the UISTM, the secretary of the National Federation of Metalworkers (FENTRAMETAL), Jaime Antonio Ruiz, was arrested at work at  a.m. on  December  by the state secret service and taken to the ""Baraya Battalion"". Also according to the UISTM, Hipolito Valderrama, a FENTRAMETAL union leader, was arrested at home at  a.m. on  December  and taken by army units to the ""Caldas Battalion"".
.According to the CLAT, the union leaders of the workers of the Agustin Codazzi Geographical Institute, Jorge Tulio Legro Tafur, Alfonzo Moya Romero, Alvaro Quijano Rozo and Henry Vicente Rivera Garca, were arrested on ,  and  January .
.Mrs. Elena Isaac Hurtado and Hernando Solano Pareo, two government employee union officials who were arrested respectively on  and  January, are in the same situation as the persons mentioned above.
.Mrs. Ligia Mayorga Manguera and Artidoro Linares Bustos of the National Union of Agricultural Industries, Francisco Eriel Santos, a trade unionist in the Croydon enterprise, and Augusto Leon Olarte Cely have also been arrested. The FENALTRASE also cites Arnulfo Zapata and Miguel Caro Diaz, government employee union leaders, Jaime Torres Fernndez and Jorge Humberto Serna, a teachers' union official. Finally, in a telegram dated  March , the CPUSTAL denounces the arrest of Osorio Rozo, general secretary of the CSTC, and the forcible entry into his home.
.In their communications, the complainants describe the ill-treatment and torture to which a large number of the detainees are said to have been subjected. They provide details on the conditions of detention and treatment inflicted on several persons, particularly Valderrama and Ruiz, and copies of several authenticated complaints submitted to the Public Prosecutor in which the signatories, many of which are trade unionists, claim to have been tortured by certain members of the armed forces.
.With respect to Decree No.  to institute a Security Statute, the Government indicates in its communication dated  April  that this text, as required by the Constitution, was submitted to the Supreme Court on  September  for a ruling on its Constitutionality. This Decree was made under Decree No.  of  October  which declares ""a breakdown of law and order and a state of siege throughout the territory of the country"". It is designed to:- ensure the complete and rapid administration of justice in Colombia;- defend labour which is a social obligation- protect the life, honour and goods of all persons and guarantee the safety of members of society;- restore law and order where it has broken down;- maintain law and order by means of the adoption of security measures.
.With respect to the claim that Decree No.  empowers bodies of the armed forces and chiefs of police to judge civilians without appeal, the Government refers to the statement of the Supreme Court that the procedure provided for under the stated Decree ""contains sufficient precautions to safeguard the rights of the offences described therein"". The Government also quotes a statement by the Prosecutor for the armed forces to the effect that the procedure laid down in the Security Statute guarantees the strict enforcement of the law in as much as the accused enjoys every right of defence throughout his trial. Finally, in the words of the Supreme Court ruling, although the abusive exercise of the right of association can be prohibited ""it must be understood that this provision does not concern the peaceful and normal exercise of the right to strike and entails no restriction on this right, which is fundamentally distinct from the right of association both in its use and in its objective"".
.With respect to the censorship of radio and television provided for under the Security Statute, the Government refers to the Supreme Court which fully admits ""the restriction and, if necessary, the banning of information and comments the broadcasting or knowledge of which could affect law and order or delay its restoration"".
.The Government states that the strike at Incametal was declared illegal by the Minister of Labour in resolution No.  of  September , a copy of which it enclosed. It transpires from this resolution that a strike occurred while a collective accord (pacto colectivo) was in force. This accord, entered into in October  by the employer and the then non-unionised workers of the enterprise, stipulates that it expires on  October .: According to the resolution, the union which, at the time of the signing of the agreement had only a small membership, had grown to represent a majority of the workers and had called a strike in order to obtain the negotiation of a collective agreement (convencin colectiva). The Ministry of Labour states that it possesses no information on the arrests that are said to have taken place on this occasion and that an inquiry into the matter has been addressed to the competent authorities.
.According to the Government, a satisfactory solution has been found to the dispute in connection with the strike in the Promel enterprise of Bogot, following the intervention of Ministry of Labour officials.
.In its communications, the Government supplies information on the persons mentioned by the complainants. According to the Government, these persons were not arrested in their capacity as workers or trade unionists, but as citizens acting outside the law and for reasons that had nothing to do whatsoever with their union activities - more specifically, according to the ministry of Defence, on the grounds of their ""probable links with a subversive movement"". The Government firmly denies the allegation that such steps were taken to repress trade union activities and states that there was certainly no intention to infringe Constitutional guarantees or rights. Furthermore, the Government asserts its determination not to relinquish its inherent right to defend the security of the State by taking action to avert and punish any subversive activity within the framework and limits of the law.
.With regard to the death of persons in circumstances that are not specified by the complainants, the",0,1979,Colombia
321,note of the present interim report.,0,1979,Brazil
322,"Committee received a communication dated  September  from the National Federation of State Workers (FENALTRASE). The Committee also received communications from the Government dated  May,  July,  August,  September and  October .
.Colombia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organisation Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.After the Committee examined the case in May , two matters remained pending. The first concerned the death of the trade union leader Pedro Pablo Bello and the other the arrest and sentencing of trade union leaders and the allegations of ill treatment to which some detainees were said to have been subjected.
.As concerns the death of Pedro Pablo Hello, a trade union official in the agricultural sector, the complainants alleged that he met his death in the course of repressive action against the peasants and indigenous population. The Government replied that it had not been established that this death was connected with trade union activities and that there was certainly no evidence that governmental authorities were involved in the death. The Committee pointed out the importance it attached, in the case of trade unionists who had lost their lives in similar situations, to the fact that the circumstances of the death were the subject of an impartial inquiry, and in accordance with this principle, it recommended to the Governing Body to request the Government to indicate whether an inquiry had been conducted into the death of Pedro Pablo Bello, and if so, to communicate its findings.
.As concerns the arrest and sentencing of trade union leaders, the complainants alleged that the Government carried out anti-union repression on the pretext of rebellion or the illegal carrying of fire-arms. The Government replied that the trade union leaders were arrested and condemned because they were acting outside the law and because of their probable links with a subversive movement. The Government added that some of the persons arrested had been sentenced for the illegal carrying of firearms, others had been take into preventive custody and the rest had been released. In this respect, the Committee pointed out that it would be useful to have precise information on the specific facts held against the persons under arrest, the legal action that had been taken against them and the results of such action. It requested in particular that in the event of conviction, a copy of the judgements rendered with the reasons adduced therefore, should be sent. To this end, the Committee recommended to the Governing Body to request the Government to supply a copy of the judgements that had been or might be pronounced on the trade union leaders, with the reasons adduced therefore, and to supply additional information on the facts which led up to their arrest.
.As regards the allegations relating to ill treatment inflicted on arrested trade unionists by the armed forces, the Government categorically denied the accusations and stated that the information supplied by the complainants could not be considered as being founded. The Committee stressed the importance of carrying an inquiry into the facts in order to establish responsibility and of taking appropriate action. It therefore recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to indicate whether inquiries had been initiated in connection with the persons named by the complainants.
.In its communication dated  September , FENALTRASE alleges that the Government is undertaking a systematic persecution of trade unions, contrary to the international obligations it has contracted with the ILO. In support of its allegation it provides a long list of trade union leaders who have been dismissed or suspended from their trade union activities, as well as documentation concerning some of these dismissals. It alleges, furthermore, that in many cases the trade union leaders concerned have subsequently been prevented from resuming their union activities.
.Lastly, FENALTRASE alleges that there has been militaristic interference in trade union organisations, resulting in acts of physical aggression against workers in the Judiciary, the arrest of union, leaders in the National University and the detention of union leaders and activists, principally in the Ministry of Finance.
.The Government sent communications dated  July,  August,  September and  October  giving some of the information requested by the Committee in its previous examination of the case.
.In its communications the Government states that, with respect to the persons who were sentenced, Jos Heriberto Higuita David and Jos Dorante Torres Osorio were arrested for the illegal carrying of fire-arms, that Manuel Castillo Riseco, Jests Hermgenes Rodriguez and, Salvador Correa Alfaro were arrested for the illegal carrying of fire-arms and explosives, that Hiplito Valderrama Ortiz was sentenced to one year's imprisonment for the illegal carrying of fire-arms and that Obdulia Prada Mayorga was sentenced to three years detention for the illegal carrying of fire-arms and explosives. The Government adds that Jos Dorante Torres Osorio has been released.
.As regards the new allegations, the Government sent a communication dated  May  setting forth the legal principles relating to the status of official employees in the public sector.
.As regards the matters which remain pending, i.e. the death of the trade unionist Pedro Pablo Bello, the arrest and sentencing of several trade union leaders and the allegations of ill treatment to which some of them were submitted, the Committee observes that the Government has furnished some information on the persons who had been sentenced but has not provided any other information on the remainder of these matters.
.As concerns the new allegations, the Committee notes furthermore that the communication dated  May  from the Government does not go beyond setting forth certain legal principles and does not reply in a concrete manner to the allegations made by the complainants.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death of Mr. Pedro Pablo Bello, to request the Government once again to indicate whether an inquiry has been conducted into his death and, if so, to communicate its findings;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the detention and sentencing of certain persons:(i) to request the Government to supply a copy of the judgements that have been pronounced, with the reasons adduced therefore, regarding Manuel Castillo Ruiseco, Salvador Correa Alfaro, Jos Heriberto Higuita David, Obdulia Prada Mayorga, Jests Hermgenes Rodriguez and Hiplito Valderrama Ortiz;(ii) to request the Government to supply additional information on the specific facts which led up to the arrest of Mximo Eduardo Cruz Puentes, Jos Luis Lozano Laguna, Jorge Elieser Diaz Russi, Humberto Galeano, Elena Isaac Hertado, Olga Lpez Jaramillo de Roldn, Jorge Tulio Legro Tafur, Marghot Clemencia Pizarro Len Gmez, Alfonso Maya Romero, Sofia de Panchn, Alfonso Prada, Humberto Serna, Hernando Solano Bareo, Alvaro Quijano Rozo, Denry Vicente Rivera Garcia and Saturniro Seplveda and to supply a copy of the judgements that may have been pronounced, with the reasons adduced therefore;(iii) to request the Government to indicate whether inquiries have been initiated in connection with the alleged ill treatment to which Hiplito Valderrama Ortiz and Antonio Ruiz Munetn were submitted during the period in which they were held in protective custody;(c) as regard the new allegations (referred to in paragraphs  and ), to request the Government to supply concrete informatics on the various matters raised by FENALTRASE;(d) to take note of this interim report.
.Complaints relating to infringements of freedom of association in Colombia and additional information have been submitted by the following organisations: World Federation, of Trade Unions (WFTU) ( January and  February ); Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT) ( February ); National Federation of State Workers (FENALTRASE) ( February ); World Confederation of Labour (WCL) ( February ); Trade Unions International of Workers in the Metal Industry (UISTM) ( March ); Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL) ( March ). The Government forwarded its observations in several communications, dated  March,  April and  May .
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In their complaints, the WFTU and several other organisations challenged Decree No. , known as the ""Security Statute"", and specifically its alleged use against trade unionists and union officials. This Statute, which is based on the legislation relating to the state of siege that has been in force in Colombia since , was promulgated on  September . Its provisions simplify judicial procedure, increase certain penalties and extend the competence of military penal law to include certain offences committed by civilians. With its letters dated  January and  February, the WFTU submitted documents signed by a number of Colombian trade union organisations claiming that the Security Statute is used against the trade union movement, that several union leaders have been arrested and are being held by the Military Institutes Brigade and that some people have been ill-treated. Trade unionists and workers have been arrested on grounds of rebellion or the illegal carrying of",0,1979,Colombia
323,"the strike called by the metalworkers' unions in the Sao Paulo region in March  and the alleged practical impossibility of exercising the right to strike; the placing under control of these organisations and the suspension of their leaders; dismissals of workers following the strike; state control of the operation of trade unions; and, finally, restrictions on the right to bargain collectively.
.As regards the decision that the strike in the metallurgical sector of Sao Paulo was illegal, it appears from the information in the Committee's possession that the dispute arose out of a difference of opinion during collective wage negotiations. A wage adjustment granted in  had, it appears, been deducted from the increases granted during negotiations in . The dispute had been brought before the labour court after the strike had broken out. The latter handed down a judgement which, on the one hand, granted a wage increase limited to that authorised by the Government and, on the other hand, declared the strike illegal on the basis of the legislative provisions regulating the right to strike. It would seem, from the information supplied by the Government, that the trade unions did not respect these provisions.
.Despite the fact that the strike had been declared illegal, it continued for almost two weeks, following which a truce was accepted for the purpose of reaching an amicable solution and work was resumed.
.In the many cases relating to the right to strike which have come before it, the Committee has considered that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests. On the basis of this principle the Committee has considered that the conditions that have to be fulfilled in order to render a strike lawful must be reasonable and in any event not such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organisations.
.The conditions fixed for the calling of a strike by Brazilian law, and in particular by Act No.  of , are of various kinds. The decision must be adopted by secret ballot by a majority vote of the general meeting of the industrial association, two-thirds of the members of the industrial association being present (in the case of a first convocation of the meeting) or one third of the members (where the general meeting is convoked for a second time). The convocation of the meeting must be published ten days beforehand in the local newspapers. The returning officers must be presided over by a magistrate, and a copy of the decision transmitted to the authorities and the employer, the latter being granted a period of five days in which to accept the claims, after which a strike may be declared subject to a further period of notice of five days.
.In the past, the Committee has considered acceptable the obligation to observe a certain quorum, to take decisions to strike by secret ballot, and to give prior notice to the employer before calling the strike. Nevertheless, the Committee feels obliged to remark that the observation of a quorum of two-thirds of the members, as fixed by Brazilian legislation for the first meeting, may be difficult to reach, in particular where trade unions have large numbers of members or cover a large area. In these circumstances the obligation to convene a further meeting at ten days' notice may result in considerable delay before a decision to strike may be considered to be valid. In this respect the Committee has taken note of a draft Bill to revise the Consolidation of Labour Laws, which was published in the Official Gazette of Brazil on  may . It notes that this draft Bill, which is now to be submitted to Parliament, proposes to reduce the quorum required before a strike can be called.
.Apart from the formal conditions for calling a strike, Brazilian legislation contains provisions regarding the submission of collective labour disputes to conciliation and arbitration. In this connection the complainants have stated that the exercise of the right to strike is denied in practice. The Committee examined these provisions of Act No.  in an earlier case relating to Brazil, when it noted that, under section  of the Act, the authorities are under the obligation to take such action as may induce a settlement between workers and employers during the five-day period following the general meeting. Furthermore, according to section , if conciliation fails, the matter is referred to the President of the Regional Labour Court. The decision of the Court is executory. As the Committee has already pointed out, the provisions mentioned above may jeopardise the workers' possibility to strike and deprive them of an essential method of promoting and defending the interests of their members. While noting that the right to strike is recognised by the Brazilian Constitution, the Committee can only confirm its conclusions in the present case and stress that such restrictions are not in conformity with the principles of freedom of association and that, if workers' organisations are under the obligation to respect the law of the land, as the Government indicates, the law of the land must not be such as to impair, nor must it be so applied as to impair, the generally accepted rights of trade unions.
.As regards the placing under control of the three unions mentioned in the complaint and the suspension of their leaders, the Committee notes the Government's statement to the effect that these measures were taken because the said leaders had failed to respect the court decision pronouncing the strike illegal. The Committee also notes with interest that, once the decision to resume work had been taken, the Government put an end to the control of the unions by the authorities and to the suspension of the union leaders.
.In connection with this aspect of the case the Committee must, however, recall that it has on a number of occasions examined cases concerning the placing under control of the unions by the Brazilian authorities. In these cases the Committee has drawn the attention of the Government to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives freely and to organise their administration and activities, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee also pointed out that the placing of trade union organisations under control entails a serious danger of restricting this right.
.In reaffirming these principles the Committee wishes to state that control of the internal activities of a trade union may be compatible with freedom of association when the organisation contravenes legislative provisions, which, however, should not be such as to violate the principles of freedom of association. Nevertheless, it is highly important, in order to guarantee the impartiality and objectiveness of the procedure, that this control should be exercised by the competent judicial authority. In this connection the Committee notes that the draft Bill to revise the Consolidation of Labour Laws mentioned above proposes to abolish the powers at present enjoyed by the Ministry of Labour to suspend trade union leaders or remove them from office, close down organisations temporarily or cancel their certificates of registration.
.The Committee notes that the Government has not sent its observations concerning the alleged dismissal of around , workers following the strike, nor concerning the general allegations that the legislation empowers the authorities to exert control over the operation of trade unions (drawing up of rules, election of officers, financial management, trade union meetings) and that the right to collective bargaining is subject to restrictions.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the right to strike, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations set forth in paragraphs  to  above and to stress that the conditions that have to be fulfilled in order to render a strike lawful must not be such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organisations;(b) as regards the placing under control of trade union organisations in the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo and the suspension of their leaders:(i) to note with interest that these measures have been lifted;(ii) nevertheless, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles set forth in paragraphs  and  above and to recall that the power of the administrative authorities to order the placing of trade unions under control and the suspension of trade union leaders do not offer the necessary guarantees to ensure the right of trade unions to organise their administration and their activities;(c) as regards the other aspects of the case, to request the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the dismissals of workers following the strike, and on the general allegations concerning the legislative provisions relating to the control exercised by the authorities on the operation of trade unions and restrictions on the right to bargain collectively;(d) to take",0,1979,Brazil
324,".In a letter dated  December  the Latin. American Central of workers submitted a complaint against the Government of Paraguay. The Government sent its comments in a letter dated  February .
.Paraguay has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Latin American Central of Workers alleged that on  December  the Government of Paraguay arrested the trade unionist Emigdio Colman.
.In its letter the Government stated that because of his political record a militant activist in the Christian Democratic Party, Mr. Colman was unable to complete the legal papers he needed to travel to the city of Caracas, Venezuela, where he was invited by CLAT to take part in a meeting of Latin American workers and the celebration of the th anniversary of the founding of the Latin American Central of Workers in December . In these circumstances, the Government reports, Mr. Colman appealed to the Venezuelan Embassy in Asuncin, where he obtained a Venezuelan emergency passport on which he then travelled. The Government adds that Mr. Colman was detained for investigation on  December  and released on  December .
.The Committee takes note of the information provided by the Government to the effect that Mr. Colman was released.
.In connection with the situation arising from the procedure for obtaining Mr. Colman's exit permit to go to a meeting of CLAT in Venezuela, which is set out in the Government's letter, the Committee recalls that in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , workers associations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers. This principle implies the right of representatives of national trade union organisations to maintain contact with the international organisations with which they are affiliated, to take part in the work of these organisations and to receive the benefits implied by such affiliation. The Committee recalls that or a previous occasion it noted that unless the formalities required of trade unionists to leave the country, are imposed on objective grounds they may involve the risk of infringing the principle of the right of national workers' associations to send representatives to international trade union congresses. In the present case the Government's statement that ""because of his political background Mr. Emigdio Colman was unable to complete the legal documentation required to travel to the city of Caracas"" does not appear properly to explain the criteria used to prevent Mr. Colman from completing the legal documents required for the journey.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that since the person concerned has been released and subject to the principles and considerations set out in the preceding paragraph, the case does not call for further examination.",0,1979,Paraguay
325,"Government replies that it has not been established that these persons were exercising trade union activities or that their death was connected with such activities and that there is certainly no evidence that they have been executed by the Government. Moreover, the Government emphatically denies that the application of the Security Statute has led to the death of union leaders.
.The Government has supplied the following information on the situation of the persons arrested. Several of them have been released; some have been sentenced under Decree no.  for the illegal carrying of firearms and others have been placed under preventive detention by order of the Eighth Penal Magistrate of the Military Institutes Brigade in connection with an inquiry into the crime of rebellion.
.Detainment orders have also been pronounced in the case of several other persons who were still being held in custody at the beginning of April .
.As regards Rozo Osorio, the Government sent with its letter of  May  a statement from the Ministry of Defence to the effect that his home has not been searched, that he has not been transferred to military premises to be interrogated by the judicial police, that he is not being sought by the military authorities and that no warrant has been issued for his arrest.
.In a communication dated  March , the Government supplies information on Hiplito Valderrama Ortiz (FENTRAMETAL union leader), who has been sentenced under Decree No.  (Security Statute) to one year's imprisonment for the illegal carrying of firearms, and on Antonio Ruiz Muneton (secretary of the same organisation), who is among the persons who have been released.
.As to the allegations of ill-treatment, the Government firmly rejects them and states that the information supplied by the complainants, and specifically the complaints referred to in paragraph  above, cannot be considered as being founded. In support of its statement, the Government submits a copy of a military court nonsuit in an inquiry instituted by the President of the Republic into the other allegations of torture. With respect to the allegation of ill-treatment to which Valderrama and Ruiz are said to have been subjected, the Government states that it is extremely important that the complainants should submit proof.
.In several cases where it has had to examine complaints of alleged infringements of freedom of association where a state of siege or of emergency has been declared or in accordance with a law on state security, the Committee has considered that it is not the Committee's business to rule on the necessity or desirability of this legislation, which is a purely political matter, but has expressed the opinion that it should investigate the possible repercussions of such legislation on trade union rights.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that, in their allegations, the complainants link the restrictions on trade union rights and the arrest of union members to the application of Decree No.  instituting a Security Statute. The Government, on the other hand, denies that the stated legislation is directed against union activities and that the persons in question have been arrested in their capacity as union members or on account of their union activities.
.The Committee has taken note of the gravity of some of the allegations which relate to the death of certain persons, and specifically the union official Pedro Pablo Bello. In this connection, the Committee has always pointed out the importance that it attaches, in the case of persons who have lost their lives in similar situations, to the fact that the circumstances of the death were the subject of an impartial and independent inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and determine responsibility.
.Nevertheless, the Committee has, in general terms, expressed the view that trade union leaders or members have the same duty as everybody to observe the law and that they benefit from no immunity in the event of its infringement. The Committee considers, however, that governments can help the Committee in its examination of cases submitted to it by providing information on the specific facts that have led to the arrest of trade unionists.
.In the present case, the Committee notes that the Government has supplied information concerning the release of several persons but that other union members referred to in the complaints have been sentenced or are still in custody.
.On many previous occasions where allegations have concerned the sentencing of trade unionists to terms of imprisonment, the Committee has invited the Government concerned to supply information on the specific facts leading up to their sentencing, together with a copy of the judgements rendered with the reasons adduced therefor. The Committee believes that it would be useful to follow this practice in the present case also, so that it can reach its conclusions in full possession of the facts.
.With regard to the persons under arrest, the Committee considers that it would likewise be useful for it to have precise information on the specific facts held against them and on the legal action that may be taken against them and the results of such action.
.The Committee recalls in this connection that, on the occasion of its examination of another case relating to Colombia, it had already stated, in connection with the arrest of trade unionists, that the bringing of detained persons before the appropriate judge without delay was one of the civil liberties which should be ensured by the authorities in order to safeguard the exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee notes that the Government categorically denies the accusations of ill-treatment submitted by the complainants and that it states that the information supplied by them cannot be considered as being founded. As regards allegations concerning the ill-treatment to which detainees are said to have been subjected, the Committee has previously stressed in general terms the importance of carrying out an inquiry into the facts in order to establish responsibilities and of taking appropriate action, in particular, to give precise instructions and apply effective sanctions so as to ensure that no detainee is subjected to ill-treatment.
.With respect to the allegations relating to strikes, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, the dispute in the Promel enterprise has been settled through the intervention by the Ministry of Labour.
.The Committee notes that the strike at Incametal, which was aimed at obtaining a collective agreement, has been declared illegal by virtue of the provisions of the Labour Code on the grounds that a collective accord (Facto colectivo) between the employer and the non-unionised workers of the enterprise was currently in force.
.In another case relating to Colombia, the Committee has already had occasion to consider the matter of collective agreements. The Committee recalled that Article  of Convention No.  (ratified by Colombia) invites governments to take appropriate measures to ""encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements."" The Committee considered that direct negotiation between the undertaking and its employees, by-passing representative organisations where these exist, might in certain cases be detrimental to the principle that negotiations between employers and organisations of workers should be encouraged and promoted. It considers it desirable to obtain information on the current situation in the dispute at Incametal.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends to the Governing Body:(a) as regards the death of Pedro Pablo Bello, to request the Government to indicate whether an inquiry has been conducted into his death and, if so, to communicate its findings;(b) as regards the allegations relating to the detention and sentencing of certain persons:(i) to note with interest that several of them have been released;(ii) to request the Government to supply additional information on the specific facts leading up to the arrest or sentencing of the trade unionists referred to (see paragraphs  and ) and to supply a copy of the judgements that have been or may be pronounced, with the reasons adduced therefor;(iii) to note the statements of the Government concerning the allegations of ill-treatment to which the detainees are said to have been subjected and to request the Government to indicate whether inquiries have been initiated in connection with the persons named by the complainants (see paragraph );(c) as regards the allegations relating to the action taken in connection with strikes:(i) to note that the strike at Promel has been resolved thanks to the intervention of the Ministry of Labour;(ii) as to the strike at Incametal, to draw the attention of the Government to the principles and considerations expressed in paragraph  above and to ask it to supply information on the current situation in the labour dispute at this enterprise;(d) to take note of the present interim report.",0,1979,Colombia

.This case was examined by the Committee in May  and November , when it presented interim reports.
.Since it last examined the case the Committee has received a communication from the Government dated  February .
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the case was last examined in November  the following matters remained pending: the death of the trade union leader Pedro Pablo Bello, the arrest and sentencing of trade union leaders and workers, the allegations of ill-treatment suffered by some of the detainees, and the new allegations made by the National Federation of workers in the Service of the State (FENALTRASE) in its communication of  September .
.As concerns the death of Pedro Pablo Bello, a trade union official in the agricultural sector, the complainants alleged that he met his death in the course of repressive action against the peasants and indigenous population. The Government replied that it had not been established that this death was connected with trade union activities, still less that governmental authorities were involved. The Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to indicate whether an inquiry had been conducted into the death of Pedro Pablo Bella, and, if so, to communicate its findings.
.As concerns the arrest and sentencing of trade union leaders and workers, the complainants alleged that the Government carried out anti-union repression an the pretext of rebellion or the illegal carrying of firearms. The Government replied that the persons concerned were arrested and sentenced because they were acting outside the law and because of their probable links with a subversive movement. The Government added that same of the persons arrested had been sentenced for the illegal carrying of firearms, others remained under arrest and the rest had been released. In a later communication the Government sent information on same of these persons. The Committee requested the Government to supply the text of the sentences pronounced an various trade union leaders, with the reasons adduced therefore, additional information on the facts which led to the arrest of other leaders and workers, and the text of any judgements that might have been given in this connection.
.As regards the allegations relating to ill-treatment inflicted an arrested trade unionists by the armed forces, the Government denied the accusations and stated that they were unfounded. The Committee recommended the Governing Body to request the Government to indicate whether inquiries had been initiated in connection with the alleged ill-treatment of the persons specifically named by the complainants.
.As regards the new allegations contained in the communication of the National Federation of workers in the Service of the State (FENALTRASE) dated  September , the Government sent a communication setting forth the legal principles relating to the status of official employees in the public sector. The Committee requested the Government to supply concrete information an the various matters raised by FENALTRASE (dismissal or suspension of trade union leaders - a list of wham was sent by the complainant along with information an same of the dismissals - an account of their trade union activities, and prevention of many leaders from continuing their trade union functions following the sanctions; interference by the armed forces with the trade union organisations, resulting in acts of physical aggression against workers in the Judiciary, the arrest of union leaders in the National University and the detention of union leaders and active trade unionists, principally in the Ministry of Finance).
.In its communication of  February  the Government states that it has no information on the domicile of Mr. Pedro Pablo Bello or any indications making it possible to establish where the alleged events occurred; although it has written to the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Colombia it has so far received no reply.
.As regards the trade union leaders who were sentenced, the Government states that Manuel Castillo Ruiseco and Obdulia Prada de Torres are at present being tried by the Military Court of Summary Jurisdiction, which passes judgement an presumed members of the ""Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia"" (FARO) and which has not yet rendered judgement. The Government also states that Salvador Correa Alfaro, Jos Heriberto Higuita David, Jess Hermgenes Rodriguez and Hiplito Valderrama Ortiz were put an trial as presumed members of the FARC and that they have now been released.
.As regards the arrest of the trade union officials and workers mentioned by the complainants, the Government states that Mximo Eduardo Cruz Puentes and Jos Luis Lozano Laguna were prosecuted for their membership of FARC and that they are at present at liberty; that Elena Isaac Hurtado, Olga Lpez Jaramillo de Roldn and Saturnina Seplveda Nio were prosecuted for their presumed links with the ""M-"" subversive movement and that they are at present at liberty; and that Jorge Elieser Diaz Russi, Jorge Tulio Legro Tafur, Marghot Clemencia Pizarra, Alfonso Maya Romero, Hernando Solana Bareo, Alvaro Quijano Raza and Henry Vicente Rivera Garcia are at present being tried by the Military Court of Summary Jurisdiction for their membership of the ""M-"" subversive group. The Government adds that it has not been possible to obtain information an the alleged imprisonment of Humberto Galeano and Sofia de Panchn.
.As regards the death of the agricultural trade union leader Pedro Pablo Bella, the Committee notes that the Government has no indications making it possible to establish where the alleged events occurred. The Committee suggests that contacts should be re-established with the Trade Union Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CSTC) in order to collect the information necessary for the conduct of an inquiry into the reasons for the death of this leader of the CSTC and the circumstances in which it took place.
.As regards the persons who were sentenced or imprisoned, the Committee notes that Salvador Correa Alfaro, Jos Heriberto Higuita David, Jesus Hermgenes Rodrguez, Hiplito Valderrama Ortiz, Mximo Eduardo Cruz Puentes, Jos Luis Lozano Laguna, Elena Isaac Hurtada, Olga Lpez Jaramillo de Roldn and Saturnina Seplveda Nia have been released. The Committee also notes that the Government has been unable to obtain information on the alleged imprisonment of Humberto Galeano and Sofia de Panchn and that the following trade unionists are at present being tried for presumed membership of or links with subversive groups: Manuel Castillo Ruiseco, Obdulia Prada de Torres, Jorge Elieser Diaz Russi, Jorge Tulio Legro Tapur, Marghot Clemencia Pizarro, Alfonso Moya Romero, Hernando Solano Bareo, Alvaro Quijano Raza and Henry Vicente Rivera Garcia.
.The Committee notes that the trade union leaders Hiplito Valderrama Ortiz and Antonio Ruiz Munetn are at liberty, although it must again remark that the Government does not specify whether an inquiry has been initiated into their alleged ill-treatment during the period of their preventive arrest. In this connection the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the fact that preventive detention should be accompanied by a set of safeguards and limitations to ensure that it cannot be used for purposes other than that for which it is designed and in particular to give protection against ill-treatment.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations in the communication of  September  from FENALTRASE, nor to the allegations relating to the detention of Alfonso Prada and Humberto Serna.
.The Committee already examined this case at its meeting in May , when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Since then, the",0,1979,Colombia
327,"which the existence of a collective accord may not interfere with the principle of equal pay for equal work where the post, length of day and conditions are effectively equal.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers that direct bargaining carried out between the undertaking and its personnel which resulted in a collective accord dated  October , without account being taken of the two trade union organisations representing the workers in the undertaking has not, in this case, conformed with the principle that collective bargaining between employers and workers' organisations must be encouraged and promoted.
.In the present case, the Committee also notes that, according to the complainant, the undertaking induced workers to leave the trade union so as to be able to sign the collective accord and dismissed those who refused to do so. In this regard, the Committee notes that by section  of Legislative Decree No.  an undertaking may sign a collective accord with non-unionised workers if the union represents less than one-third of the workers. The Committee considers generally that such a provision could allow the risk of encouraging acts of anti-union discrimination aimed at reducing the number of unionised workers so as to be able to conclude a collective accord.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) as regards the dismissal of trade union leaders and militants, to suggest to the Government that it take measures along the lines of those outlined in paragraph  above so as to re-establish a social climate more favourable to the development of good industrial relations;(b) as regards the appeal to cancel the collective accord signed by the management and the non-unionised workers of the Cano Isaza and Co. undertaking, to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations and principles set out in paragraphs  and  above and to request it to keep the Committee informed of the outcome of the appeal before the Director General of Labour.",0,1979,Colombia
328,".This case was examined by the Committee in May , November , May  and February , when it presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since it last examined the case, the Committee has received communications from the Government dated  February,  March and  April .
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the case was examined in February  there remained pending the questions relating to the death of the trade union leader Pedro Pablo Bello, the trial or detention of trade union leaders or workers and the allegations made by the National Federation of Workers in the Service of the State (FENALTRASE) in its last communication dated  September  (dismissal or suspension of trade union leaders - of whom a list was sent by the complainant along with documentation on some of the dismissals - on account of their trade union activities; prevention of many leaders from continuing their trade union functions following such sanctions, interference by the armed forces in trade union organisations resulting in acts of physical aggression against civil servants employed in the Judiciary, the arrest of union leaders of the National University and the detention of union leaders and active trade unionists, mainly in the Ministry of Finance).
.The Committee recommended the Governing Body to approve the following conclusions:(a) Regarding the allegation relating to the agricultural trade union leader, Pedro Pablo Bello, the Committee deeply regretted his death and requested the Government to send any information on the outcome of the judicial investigation that had been undertaken.(b) As regards the other allegations:(i) the Committee requested the Government to communicate the text of the judgements, together with the reasons adduced therefore, which might be handed down on the following trade union leaders and workers being tried at present for presumed membership of or links with subversive groups: Manuel Castillo Ruiseco, Obdulia Prada de Torres, Jorge Elieser Diaz Russi, Jorge Tulio Legro Tafur, Marghot Clemencia Pizarro, Alfonso Moya Romero, Hernando Solano Bareo, Alvaro Quijano Rozo and Henry Vicente Rivera Garcia;(ii) the Committee again requested the Government to send information on the detention of Alfonso Prada and Humberto Serna and to reply to the allegations contained in the communication of FELANTRASE of  September .
.In its communication dated  February  the Government states that on  August , the Military Court of Summary Jurisdiction, which tries members of the ""M-"" subversive group, annulled the detention order against Alfonso Prada and he was released. The Government adds that Mr. Humberto Serna has not been detained.
.In its communication dated  March  the Government states that, following her trial, Obdulia Prada de Torres was acquitted by the Military Court of Summary Jurisdiction. The Government adds that Manuel Castillo Ruiseco was sentenced on  March  to ten years' imprisonment for the crime of rebellion and that, as regards the other persons figuring in the complaint, trial proceedings are continuing before the Military Court of Summary Jurisdiction which tries members of the ""M-"" subversive movement for crimes against the internal security of the State, and not because of any trade union persecution or because of trade union membership or activities.
.The Government points out, nevertheless, that being animated by the desire to restore peace in the country and accepting the proposals made by the Peace Commission set up for this purpose, it has issued Decree No.  of  February , and that it will be possible for both Manuel Castillo Ruiseco, who was sentenced to a term of imprisonment, and the persons at present being tried to benefit from the provisions of this Decree, within a period of two months of the date of issue thereof; this will quash the prison sentence in the case of the former and the penal proceedings in the case of the others, provided that those concerned and the illegal groups to which they belong hand over the arms in their possession.
.In its communication of  April  the Government states that Mr. Pedro Pablo Bello's death had nothing to do with activities of a trade union character and it adds, as regards the FENALTRASE communication of  September , that there is no truth in the statement that trade unionists bad been attacked or that trade union premises had been broken into.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that the death of the agricultural leader, Pedro Pablo Bello, had nothing to do with activities of a trade union character. In this respect, while noting this statement, the Committee requests the Government to send any information which it may obtain on the judicial inquiry that has been undertaken into the circumstances of the death.
.The Committee notes that Alfonso Prada was released upon the annulment by the Military Court of Summary Jurisdiction, which tries members of the ""M-"" subversive group, of the detention order against him, and that Humberto Serna has not been detained. Consequently, the Committee considers that the allegation relating to the detention of these persons does not call for further examination.
.As regards the allegations relating to the trial of several trade union leaders and workers, the Committee notes that, following her trial, Obdulia Torres was acquitted. It also notes that, in accordance with Decree No.  issued by the Government on  February , it will be possible for both Manuel Castilla Ruiseco, who was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for the crime of rebellion, and the persons at present being tried to benefit from the provisions of this Decree, within a period of two months from the date of issue thereof, and that this will quash the sentence in the case of the former and the penal proceedings for the others, subject to the conditions laid down in the Decree, i.e. provided that those concerned and the illegal organisations to which they belong hand over the arms in their possession. In these circumstances, taking account of the fact that the Government has stated that those concerned were brought to trial for crimes against the internal security of the State and not because of any trade union persecution whatever, nor for trade union membership or activities and likewise taking account of the fact that the conditions laid down in Decree No.  for the quashing of the sentence passed on Manuel Castillo Ruiseco and of the penal proceedings against those brought to trial would not give rise to objection from the point of view of the principles of freedom of association, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.As regards allegations contained in the FENALTRASE communication dated  September , the Committee observes that the complainant did not at that time supply any information on the number of persons who were apparently arrested or detained; that more than two-and-a-half years have passed since the dismissals referred to took place and that the Government has denied the rest of the allegations which, moreover, are formulated in very general terms. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that, in view of the time which has elapsed and of the fact that some allegations were neither initially nor subsequently formulated with the necessary precision, this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) regarding the allegation relating to the death of the agricultural trade union leader, Pedro Pablo Bello, the Committee requests the Government to send any information which it may obtain on the judicial investigations under way into the circumstances of the death;(b) regarding the allegations relating to the detention or trial of several trade union leaders for presumed membership of or links with subversive groups, and the allegations contained in the FENALTRASE communication dated  September , the Committee considers that they do not call for further examination.
.This case was examined by the Committee in May , November  and May , when it presented interim reports.
.Since it last examined the case the Committee has received a communication from the Government dated  January .
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes that according to the Government it may be said that all evidence indicates that the death of the agricultural trade union leader, Pedro Pablo Bello, had no connection with his trade union activities but rather with disturbances of public order. The Committee deeply regrets the death of the agricultural trade union leader Pedro Pablo Bello and asks the Government to send any information on the outcome of the judicial investigations underway.
.The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the other allegations which remain pending. Consequently, the Committee again requests the Government for its observations on these matters.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to",0,1979,Colombia
329,"In their last communication the ICFTU and IMF state that the political police arrested one of the organisers of the strike, Osmar Mendonca, when he was in a church proposing a return to work, and that  trade unionists - including Luis Incio da Silva - were released on  May, although the authorities had arrested six trade union leaders on suspicion of having continued the action which had been begun by those who were under arrest. In their communication of  April , the ICFTU and IMF state that, on  April, the police announced the prohibition of assemblies of strikers in districts where general assemblies were to have been held.
.The complainants also allege that , metalworkers were dismissed on  May  - two days after the strike had ended - and stress the need to adopt new labour legislation in conformity with ILO Conventions.
.In its communication of  January , the FNT states that the trade union leaders were to be tried in February under the National Security Act. In its communication of  February , the ICFTU and IMF state that these persons are Luis Inacio da Silva, Rubens Teodoro Arruda, Djalma de Souza Bom, Osmar Santos Mendoa, Enilson Simoes de Moura, Gilson Luiz Correia de Menezes, Jurandir Batista Magalhes, Nelson Campanholo and Manoel Anisio Gomes (the Trade Union of Metalworkers of So Bernardo do Campo); and Jos Cicote, Jos Timteo da Silva and Jos Maria de Almeida (the Trade Union of Metalworkers of Santo Andre).
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that, now that ""the charismatic hold"" of Luis Incio da Silva over his followers has been broken and that he and the other trade union leaders have been released, social peace has returned to the category of professional metalworkers of Sao Paulo.
.According to the Government, the strike was called on  March  after the labour authorities had exhausted all possibilities of negotiation with a view to bringing about conciliation between the metalworkers' unions and the employers of Group  of the FIESP.
.Among the wage claims made, according to the Government, was the demand for a  per cent increase over and above the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), which, if it had been granted, would have involved an adjustment of almost  per cent per annum at a time when inflation was running at only  per cent. In the course of the negotiations which preceded the strike, the employers repeatedly raised their offers of percentage increases above the NCPI, but their offers were rejected.
.In its decision of  April , states the Government, the Regional Labour Court (RLC) of the second region granted an increase of  or  per cent (depending on the situation of the workers) in return for higher productivity. This increase was rejected and the strike continued, thus marking contempt for a decision of the labour court; the strike was therefore declared illegal by the RLC on  April under section  of Act No.  of  June , which stipulates that ""a strike shall be terminated by decision of a labour court"", and under section  of the same Act, which prohibits strikes ""for the purpose of altering the fixed conditions of a decision handed down by a labour court"". The Government also remarks that no appeal was made against the court decision of  April.
.The Government states that the object of the assumption of control of the trade unions ordered by the Minister was to halt a strike which had deviated from its true purpose and which relegated the legitimate demands of workers to second place; the Government adds that this action was carried out under section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws, which empowers the labour authority, in the event of a dispute or of circumstances of such a nature as to disrupt the operation of a trade union body, to intervene for the purpose of taking control of such body and to propose or take the necessary steps to ensure that it again functions normally. In application of the law, continues the Government, the trade union leaders were removed from office, a sanction provided for by section b of the Consolidation of Labour Laws in the event of a suspension of services or contempt for the decisions of the labour courts at the instigation or orders of the leaders.
.As regards the arrests and interrogations, the Government states that the leaders mentioned by the WCL were imprisoned for contempt of the RLC's injunction to terminate the strike and for contravention of the National Security Act, under section  of which incitement to collective contravention of the Act and incitement to hostility to the armed forces, or the encouragement of hostility between the armed forces and classes of society or civil institutions, are punishable as offences. The Government adds that the orders for the arrest of the above-mentioned trade union leaders were countermanded on  and  May , that any offences for which they may be responsible are still under examination by the judicial authorities, and that the trials of the leaders are continuing.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statement that the strike was declared illegal by a decision of the judicial authority in application of sections  and  of Act No.  because it had been continued by the trade union leaders and workers in contempt of the earlier court order making a binding settlement as regards wage increases. The Committee also notes that the strike ended on  May  and that there is now social peace in the metallurgical sector.
.After examining the statements of the Government, the Committee wishes to point out, as it has already done quite recently in the case of similar complaints against the Government of Brazil, that the right to strike is one of the essential means through which workers and their organisations may promote and defend their occupational interests on the basis of this principle the Committee has considered that the conditions that have to be fulfilled in order to render a strike lawful must be reasonable and, in any event, not such as to place a substantial limitation on the means of action open to trade union organisations.
.In the present case the Committee observes that the dispute between the workers and the employers of the metallurgical sector of Sao Paulo was referred to the courts, which, on the day following the declaration of the strike, gave a binding decision regulating the disputed wage issues and thus making it unlawful to continue the strike. In this respect, although in some cases the Committee has recognised that the obligation to notify the administrative authorities in advance and to have recourse to conciliation and voluntary arbitration procedures in collective labour disputes may not be regarded as a violation of the principles of freedom of association, the Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the imposition of compulsory arbitration, whether by judicial or by administrative authority, may prevent the workers from resorting to strike action - particularly if the penalties for those who do so are serious - thus depriving them of an essential method of promoting and defending the interests of their members.
.As regards the placing under control of the trade unions by the authorities, the removal from office of trade union leaders and their replacement by government officials, the Committee notes that section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws authorises such intervention in the event of disputes or circumstances of such a nature as to disrupt the normal operation of a trade union body, and that section b of the Consolidation of Labour Laws permits the removal from office of leaders in the event of suspension of services or contempt for decisions of the labour courts.
.In connection with this aspect of the case the Committee must, however, recall that it has on a number of occasions examined cases concerning the placing under control of the unions by the Brazilian authorities. In these cases the Committee has drawn the attention of the Government to the importance which it attaches to the principle that workers' organisations should have the right to elect their representatives and organise their administration and activities in full freedom, and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede the lawful exercise thereof. The Committee has also pointed out that the placing of trade union organisations under control entails a serious danger of restricting this right. Furthermore, the Government does not state whether it has put an end to the control of the trade unions and whether the trade union leaders have been able to resume office. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in this respect.
.As regards the imprisonment of the trade union leaders mentioned by the complainants and the court cases in which they are going to appear, the Committee notes the Government's statement that the orders for the",-1,1980,Brazil
330,"of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.",0,1980,El Salvador
331,".The Committee last examined these cases at its February  meeting, in the light of information obtained during a direct contacts mission conducted in El Salvador from  to  January . (See rd Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (February-March ).)
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in May  and May  (see th and th Reports of the Committee); and Case No.  at its meeting in November  (see th Report of the Committee).
.Since these cases were last examined by the Committee, new allegations have been submitted by the following organisations: the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession ( May ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May and  June ), the World Federation of Trade Unions ( May ) and the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador ( June,  and  July,  September,  October and  December ). The Government submitted certain observations in communications dated  July,  August and  September ,  and  January,  and  February and  April .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with concern that since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have submitted extremely serious allegations concerning the death and arrest of trade union officials and trade unionists, the searching of the headquarters of a trade union organisation and various actions of interference and anti-trade union discrimination.
.The Committee notes that the trial concerning the murder of the trade union official Jos Aristides Mndez has been opened and that the presumed authors of the crime have been identified and arrested. The Committee nevertheless notes that in referring to the other two cases, the Government has merely pointed out that the trade unionist Francisco Mndez is not on the lists of forensic tests carried out and that the security forces know nothing about the death or disappearance of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes, although investigations are still under way. The Committee stresses the importance of carrying out a judicial investigation in all cases with a view to elucidating the facts, determining the responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties if it is proven that offences have been committed. Furthermore, the Committee notes that with respect to the alleged murder of Toms Rosales and the injuries allegedly suffered by Rafael Hernndez, judicial investigations carried out proved that crimes of this nature had not been committed. Finally, the Committee notes that it has not been possible to identify the murderers of Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez during the trial conducted to this effect and that the trial concerning the death of Rodolfo Viera and two North American trade unionists (Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman) is still under way.
.As regards the alleged arrests of trade union officials and trade unionists, the Committee notes the release of Victor Manuel Martnez, Francisco Palacios, Febe Elizabeth Velsquez, Etelvina Snchez Vsquez, Adela Margarita Navarrete, David Rolando Oliva and Juan Gilberto Durn. As charges against those concerned were dropped and bearing in mind the general grounds for arrest communicated by the Government in some cases against the persons concerned, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures of detention which restrict the exercise of trade union rights can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities (see, for example, rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (El Salvador), paras.  and ) and that when this is connected with activities in the defence of the interests of workers, it constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular (see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ).
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government pointed out that Jos Edgar Gmez Guerrero, Cecilio Guzmn Prez, Leonel Arvalo Morales, Jaime Ernesto Martnez Menjvar, Andrs Valiente and Celso Antonio Rivas Henrquez were arrested and put on trial on charges of belonging to terrorist groups. The Government also mentioned the trial of Daniel Rosaide Cullar and Rafael Vsquez Fabin without going into further detail. The Committee requests the Government to give information on this and, in particular, to indicate the specific facts with which all the trade unionists mentioned above are charged so that it might examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts. The Committee also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding these arrests. Finally, the Committee notes that the name of Santos Ventura is not on the lists of detained persons, that Jos Antonio Garca Hernndez and Julio Hernndez Rojas are being detained on the charge of murdering a trade union official and that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegations concerning the arrest of Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), Adalberto Martnez ( June ), Andrs Miranda ( June ), Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ), and the arrest of the  trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  of the rd Report.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, no public security body knows anything about the arrest of the trade union officials Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos. In view of the allegations that these persons are missing, the Committee repeats its request that a judicial inquiry should be carried out to ascertain their whereabouts.
.As regards the allegation that the registration of the most representative executive committee of the Textile Workers' Trade Union of Industras Unidas SA was refused, the Committee notes the Government's comments, according to which various general assemblies were held one after the other and that, apart from one case, irregularities had occurred. The Committee considers that in the present case it does not have enough information at its disposal to be able to come to a decision on this matter. However, it notes that there is a possibility that there might be grounds to initiate legal proceedings and that this right does not seem to have been exercised.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the raid of the ANDES premises on  April  by the armed forces, who took away documents such as the list of members; it also failed to mention the dismissal of six union officials in the telecommunications sector because of the strike of  April .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee is conscious of the difficult situation that the country is going through; however, it considers it necessary to request from the Government the information referred to below so as to be able to reach conclusions in full knowledge of all the facts raised in the allegations and in the light of the situation prevailing in the country.b) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the alleged murders of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes (Case No. ), and to carry out a judicial inquiry into this matter. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on developments in the trials concerning the murder of trade union official Jos Aristides Meja (Case No. ) and the murder of Rodolfo Viera and the two North American trade unionists, Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman (Case No. ). As regards this last point, the Committee regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed since the murders, a final judgement has not been handed down.c) The Committee requests the Government to carry out a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos (Case No. ) and expresses the hope that this will ascertain their whereabouts.d) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the trade unionists who are still detained and/or being tried, indicating, in particular, the specific facts with which they are charged (Cases Nos.  and ). It also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding the arrests of those concerned.e) The Committee requests the Government to comment on the allegations to which it has not replied, which are referred to in the previous paragraph.
.At its February  meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a",0,1980,El Salvador
332,"direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).
.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations",0,1980,El Salvador
333,"to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.From the outset the Government, although it transmitted no comments on this case, refuted none of these allegations and on  September  furnished information to the effect that Carlos Hernndez, another trade union leader, had been arrested on  June , the day of the strike, for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the installations of the undertaking and had been released on  June .
.Thereafter, in other communications, the Government never denied the facts alleged by the complainant organisation but did not transmit, as requested by the Committee, its observations concerning the death of Toms Rosales and the wounds inflicted on four other trade unionists on  June  during a peaceful strike at the Granja Santa Ins.
.The Committee observes, however, that in its communication of  January  the Government denies any knowledge of the facts alleged, according to a report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety contained in Note No.  dated  June .
.The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information on this case, which has been requested several times and it recalls that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only where fundamental human rights are respected. It can only deplore the existence of situations in which trade unionists are killed or wounded in the performance of their trade union functions and in particular when engaged in peaceful strikes. It draws the Government's attention to the urgent need to take active measures to prevent in the future any loss of human life in similar situations.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) concerned the murder of trade union leaders. In a communication of  April  the WCL reported that Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, the leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, had been murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard in the Jess Suburb of San Ramn, Department of Cuscatln, at midnight on  May . In addition Manuel Antonio Carillo and Jos Antonio Carillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Limited, had been murdered by agents of repressive forces on  June ; this, said the complainant organisation, was proved by the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. In addition, Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary-General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers in the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (ANTMAG), had been taken to Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, had subsequently been arrested by the rural police and had since disappeared.
.Successive items of information transmitted by the Government showed that investigations were being made into the murder of these four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary-General of ANTMAG. The Government had never denied the facts but had not supplied specific information on the circumstances surrounding the death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Antonio Carillo or Jos Antonio Carillo or the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. In May  the Committee urged the Government to supply such information without delay. In addition it drew attention to the importance it attached to the holding of an independent judicial inquiry when there was loss of human life.
.As in the previous case, the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication of  January last, declares that the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety knows nothing whatsoever about the death of these persons and that Rafael Hernndez is not, to its knowledge, detained by any unit of the forces of public safety according to information received in Note No.  of  February  which contains a report from the Ministry in question.
.The Committee draws attention to the contradiction between the earlier information and this last communication, inasmuch as it was stated previously that investigations into these murders were under way. The Committee again emphasises the need to ensure that justice punishes the guilty parties and for the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigation and any penalties imposed. In addition it urges the Government to supply precise information on these events and, in particular, on the fate of Rafael Hernndez Olivo.
.In this case, on  January  the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January , of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary-General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send it the text of any judgment handed down.
.The Government, in its communication of  March , repeated the same information but added that judgment had been delivered in the proceedings against other accused persons who were deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, but that the parties had lodged appeals.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the Second Criminal Chamber of the First Section of the Central Court delivered on appeal a ruling dated  April  pursuant to sections  and  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of which the Government supplies an extract. This ruling upholds the dismissal, by order of the Supreme Court dated  December , of the charges against Ernesto Sol Meza and Hans Krist after they had lodged their application therefore; it confirms the judgment delivered against the accused Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez, from which they had appealed, and stays execution with a reservation in favour of Lieutenant Lpez Sibrian;",0,1980,El Salvador
334,"example, Fourth Report, Case No.  (United Kingdom/Malaya), para.  stressed the importance which it attaches to all detained persons receiving a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee considers that measures of preventive detention should be limited to very short periods intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry. [See rd Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. .]
.The Committee has examined these cases on several occasions, most recently at its November  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Subsequently, the Government sent further information in a communication dated  March .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.Since the Government supplied no information on this aspect of the case in November , the Committee reiterated its request that the Government communicate its observations concerning the alleged killing of Toms Rosales and wounding of four other trade unionists on  June  at the undertaking of El Grarjero S. A.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government does not refute any of these allegations but merely repeats the information submitted on  September , to the effect that, on  June , Carlos Hernndez was arrested for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the undertaking's property and that he was subsequently released on  June .
.The Committee again notes this information. It observes, however, that the Government does not deny the allegations of the complainant.
.In the circumstances, the Committee can only deplore the alleged violent death of the union leader, Toms Rosales, and the injuries inflicted by the armed forces on other Granja Santa Ins trade unionists on  June  in the course of a labour dispute. Given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, the committee urges the Government to take steps to prevent any loss of human life.
.The complaint presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) refers to the assassination of trade union leaders. According to the WCL in a communication dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzals, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were assassinated by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight on  May  in the Jsus suburb of San Ramn in the Department of Cuscatln. The complainant further alleges that Manual Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders o the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers' Co-operative Limited, were assassinated on  June  by members of repressive forces, basing their allegations on the calibre of the bullets found near the dead bodies. It also states that Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers of the-Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, was subsequently arrested by the rural police and that his whereabouts were unknown.
.In November , the Committee noted the Government's statement that investigations were being made into the death of the four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary General of ANTMAG. The Committee emphasised the importance that the guilty parties should be tried and punished and that the Government should keep it informed of the results of the investigation and of the action taken against those responsible.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government states that the information concerning this complaint has been communicated to the relevant bodies to help them in their inquiries.
.The Committee observes that the alleged assassination of the peasant, trade unionists occurred in May and June , since when the Government has not denied the facts and states that investigations are still under way. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied any specific information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzals, Marvel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee urges the Government to transmit this information without delay. It must recall the importance in all cases involving the loss of human life of carrying out an independent judicial inquiry. As the Committee has stated in the past,' the atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue could be restored more easily once the responsibilities of those concerned have been established and the persons who have abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.
.The complaint presented by the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAI) concerns the arrest by the police on  July  of the trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, all of whom were arrested during a discussion of a list of grievances in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In a communication dated June , the Government stated, with respect to the arrest of members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Workers in Transport and Allied industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos , that a trial was under way.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government indicates that information regarding Case No.  will be submitted separately.
.The Committee once again urges the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this trial and, in particular, to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro cited by name by the complainants, have been released.
.In this case, the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January  o Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death on  January  of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send in the text of any judgement handed down.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government repeats its earlier statement that the trial is being held in the Fifth Criminal court, that one of the accused has been released by order of the Supreme Court and that the other has been acquitted. It adds that the judgement concerning other accused persons considered to be the actual perpetrators of the crime was handed down early in December  but that the parties concerned have lodged an appeal.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement and requests it to continue keeping it informed of developments in this case. The Committee feels that it would be of the utmost value for it to have the text of the final judgement that will be handed down.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) In general terms, the Committee once again deeply deplores the violent death of several trade union leaders and, given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement car develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, urges the Government to take action to prevent any loss of human life. The Committee urges the Government to transmit without delay information on the circumstances in which these trade union leaders lost their lives.(b) In Case No. , the Committee urges the Government to communicate information on the outcome of the trial concerning the arrest o members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of workers in Transport and Allied Industries, which occurred almost three years ago - on  July  - when the trade unionists concerned were discussing a list of wage claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -. The Committee urges the Government to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, cited by name by the complainants, have been released.(c) In Case No. , the Committee notes that the trial of the presumed perpetrators of the assassination of the trade union leader, Rodolfo Viera, and of Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, two American trade",0,1980,El Salvador
335,"that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available,",-1,1980,El Salvador
336,"in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and",0,1980,El Salvador
337,"trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating",-1,1980,El Salvador
338,".The Committee has examined these cases on several occasions, most recently at its November  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Subsequently, the Government sent further information in a communication dated  March .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.Since the Government supplied no information on this aspect of the case in November , the Committee reiterated its request that the Government communicate its observations concerning the alleged killing of Toms Rosales and wounding of four other trade unionists on  June  at the undertaking of El Grarjero S. A.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government does not refute any of these allegations but merely repeats the information submitted on  September , to the effect that, on  June , Carlos Hernndez was arrested for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the undertaking's property and that he was subsequently released on  June .
.The Committee again notes this information. It observes, however, that the Government does not deny the allegations of the complainant.
.In the circumstances, the Committee can only deplore the alleged violent death of the union leader, Toms Rosales, and the injuries inflicted by the armed forces on other Granja Santa Ins trade unionists on  June  in the course of a labour dispute. Given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, the committee urges the Government to take steps to prevent any loss of human life.
.The complaint presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) refers to the assassination of trade union leaders. According to the WCL in a communication dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzals, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were assassinated by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight on  May  in the Jsus suburb of San Ramn in the Department of Cuscatln. The complainant further alleges that Manual Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders o the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers' Co-operative Limited, were assassinated on  June  by members of repressive forces, basing their allegations on the calibre of the bullets found near the dead bodies. It also states that Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers of the-Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, was subsequently arrested by the rural police and that his whereabouts were unknown.
.In November , the Committee noted the Government's statement that investigations were being made into the death of the four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary General of ANTMAG. The Committee emphasised the importance that the guilty parties should be tried and punished and that the Government should keep it informed of the results of the investigation and of the action taken against those responsible.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government states that the information concerning this complaint has been communicated to the relevant bodies to help them in their inquiries.
.The Committee observes that the alleged assassination of the peasant, trade unionists occurred in May and June , since when the Government has not denied the facts and states that investigations are still under way. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied any specific information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzals, Marvel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee urges the Government to transmit this information without delay. It must recall the importance in all cases involving the loss of human life of carrying out an independent judicial inquiry. As the Committee has stated in the past,' the atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue could be restored more easily once the responsibilities of those concerned have been established and the persons who have abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.
.The complaint presented by the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAI) concerns the arrest by the police on  July  of the trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, all of whom were arrested during a discussion of a list of grievances in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In a communication dated June , the Government stated, with respect to the arrest of members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Workers in Transport and Allied industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos , that a trial was under way.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government indicates that information regarding Case No.  will be submitted separately.
.The Committee once again urges the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this trial and, in particular, to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro cited by name by the complainants, have been released.
.In this case, the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January  o Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death on  January  of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send in the text of any judgement handed down.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government repeats its earlier statement that the trial is being held in the Fifth Criminal court, that one of the accused has been released by order of the Supreme Court and that the other has been acquitted. It adds that the judgement concerning other accused persons considered to be the actual perpetrators of the crime was handed down early in December  but that the parties concerned have lodged an appeal.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement and requests it to continue keeping it informed of developments in this case. The Committee feels that it would be of the utmost value for it to have the text of the final judgement that will be handed down.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) In general terms, the Committee once again deeply deplores the violent death of several trade union leaders and, given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement car develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, urges the Government to take action to prevent any loss of human life. The Committee urges the Government to transmit without delay information on the circumstances in which these trade union leaders lost their lives.(b) In Case No. , the Committee urges the Government to communicate information on the outcome of the trial concerning the arrest o members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of workers in Transport and Allied Industries, which occurred almost three years ago - on  July  - when the trade unionists concerned were discussing a list of wage claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -. The Committee urges the Government to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, cited by name by the complainants, have been released.(c) In Case No. , the Committee notes that the trial of the presumed perpetrators of the assassination of the trade union leader, Rodolfo Viera, and of Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, two American trade unionists representing the AFI-CIC in El Salvador, is still under way. The Committee once again requests the Government to continue communicating detailed information on the case, including the text of the final judgement once it has been handed down.
.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union",0,1980,El Salvador
339,"the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.",0,1980,El Salvador
340,"unionists representing the AFI-CIC in El Salvador, is still under way. The Committee once again requests the Government to continue communicating detailed information on the case, including the text of the final judgement once it has been handed down.
.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at",-1,1980,El Salvador
341,"in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the",0,1980,El Salvador
342,".Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly,",-1,1980,El Salvador
343,"the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly, in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which",0,1980,El Salvador
344,"it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations",-1,1980,El Salvador
345,"referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.
.In a telegram dated  March , the international Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in El Salvador. Also, additional information was received from the complainant organisation in two letters dated  March and  July , respectively. These various communications were forwarded to the Government, which supplied observations in a letter dated  September .
.As outlined in paragraphs  and  of this report, numerous other complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association have been receives, which are the subject of Cases Nos. , , ,  and  . The complaints mainly concern violent deaths, ill-treatment and arrests of trade union leaders and searches of trade union premises. These complaints have been transmitted to the Government, which has not yet sent its observations. The Committee deplores this situation, and intends to examine these cases at its next session.
.El Salvador has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communications of  and  March , ICFTU alleged that trade union leaders of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), which is affiliated to it and represents rural workers among others, were threatened by members of the National Guard of El Salvador on  February  while they were upholding wage claims made by the workers. The complainant organisation specifies that the threats were directed against Jorge Alberto Casillo Muoz, Hector Cncamo Gomez, Juan Pablo Portillo, Jorge Alberto Esquivel and Carlos Antonin Tejada. The complainant organisation also alleges that on  February  the armed forces broke into the premises of FESINCONSTRANS at San Miguel, threatening the trade unionists Zzimo Mercado and Antonio Arias Gonzlez and destroying the trade union files.
.Further allegations were made by ICFTU on  July  to the effect that on  June  armed forces attacked rural workers who had called a peaceful strike to get the management of the undertaking El Granjero SA to accept a number of wage claims under discussion for two months. According to the complainant organisation, Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, affiliated to FESINCONSTRANS, was killed during these clashes and four otter trade unionists wounded.
.ICFTU also alleges teat Carlos Hernndez, a leader of the local trade union mentioned above, was carried off and that the place where he is being held is still unknown despite the approaches which FESINCONSTRANS has made to the authorities, both the Ministry of Defence and the Private Secretariat of the Government Junta, to ascertain his whereabouts.
.In its letter dated  September , the Government explains that a peaceful work stoppage was in fact held on  June  at the undertaking El Granjero SA but the police force had to intervene in order to disperse the strike pickets threatening to damage the undertaking's property, particularly as a number of persons known for their terrorist proclivities had infiltrated their ranks, including Carlos Hernndez who, having incited his companions to disturb the public order, had to be arrested by the military authorities. However, he was released on  June , adds the Government, which has supplied a copy of a statement signed by Mr. Hernandez at the time of his release recognising that he had incited his companions to carry out a work stoppage constituting a disturbance of public order.
.The Committee notes that in the present case the issues raised relate, on the one hand, to the occupation of trade union premises, the destruction of files and threats directed against trade union leaders upholding the wage claims of rural workers and, on the other, to the intervention of the armed forces to break a peaceful strike, the death of a trade unionist and the wounding of several others during clashes with the military forces, as well as the arrest of a trade union leader.
.Regarding the occupation of trade union premises, the destruction of files and threats against trade union leaders, the Committee notes that the Government has not yet supplied any observations.
.Regarding the intervention by the armed forces to break a strike in the undertaking El Granjero SA and the arrest of a trade union leader during the dispute, the Committee takes note of the explanations supplied by the Government to the effect that persons known for their terrorist proclivities had infiltrated among the strikers, including Carlos Hernndez who was arrested on  June and released on  June . It emerges from the information supplied by the Government, however, that Mr. Hernandez was arrested only for having incited the workers to strike, and that the work stoppage had a peaceful character.
.First of all, as regards the complaint relating to the events at the undertaking El Granjero SA, the Committee observes that the Government has made no comment about the death of a trade union leader and the wounding of several others resulting from clashes with the armed forces when the latter intervened to put an end to the strike.
.In this connection, the Committee must however recall that in cases where the dispersal of demonstrations has resulted in loss of human life and injury, it has always' attached special importance to the need to proceed immediately to an impartial and full inquiry to determine responsibility for the action.
.Further, as regards the intervention of the armed forces to put an end to the strike, the Committee wishes first of all to stress the importance it attaches",0,1980,El Salvador
346,"to the principle that the right to strike must be regarded as one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations for protecting their economic and, social interests. The Committee has also implied on several occasions that it regards the use of police for strike-breaking purposes as an infringement of trade union rights, adding that the intervention of the police should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) regarding the intervention of the armed forces during the strike at the undertaking El Granjero SA:(i) to draw the attention of the Government to the considerations set forth in the above paragraph, especially the fact that use of police for breaking a strike constitutes an infringement of trade union rights and that the intervention of the police should be limited to the maintenance of public order;(ii) to invite the Government in connection with the allegations relating to the death of Toms Rosales and the wounding of four other trade unionists to state whether a judicial inquiry has been carried out to determine responsibility for the action and to supply its results as soon as they are available;(iii) to note that the trade union leader Carlos Hernndez, arrested during the strike, has been released;(b) to request the Government to supply its observations concerning the allegations relating to the occupation of trade union premises, the destruction of files and threats directed against trade union leaders upholding the wage claims of rural workers;(c) to take note of this interim report.",0,1980,El Salvador

.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly, in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective",-1,1980,El Salvador
348,"the earliest possible moment, it pointed out that the arrests of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference in trade union activities.
.Lastly, in general terms, it considered that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective in the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons referred to by the complainants, with a view to freeing those arrested for trade union reasons.
.In this connection, the allegations in Case No.  should be recalled. According to CPUSTAL, on  July , trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrquez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro had been arrested by police while discussing a list of claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In its communication of June , the Government states, concerning the detention of leaders of the National Union of Workers in the Transport and Allied Industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -, that a trial is under way.
.The Committee notes that in this case the trade union leaders in question seem to have been in custody for over two years. In this respect, it wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that preventive detention without conviction by a court should not exceed a very brief period and should be intended only to facilitate a judicial inquiry. Holding persons indefinitely in custody without trial is a practice which involves inherent danger of abuse and is for this reason subject to criticism.
.In consequence, the Committee, while noting that a trial is under way, requests the Government to supply the text of the judgement with the grounds therefore, and hopes that, in so far as these trade union leaders have been imprisoned only for legitimate trade union activities, they will be released as soon as possible.""
.The Government was also requested to send its observations on the allegations to which it had not replied, and which, according to the ICFTU in a communication dated  March  relating to Case No. , chiefly concerned an alleged attack by the armed forces on the San Miguel premises of the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Construction, Transport and Allied Industries (FESINCONSTRANS), an organisation affiliated to the ICFTU. During the attack, which is alleged to have taken place on  February  at . p.m., the lives of trade unionists were threatened and trade union records destroyed.
.The Committee regrets, despite the time which has elapsed since the complaint was presented, the absence of the information requested of the Government on this aspect of the case. The Committee notes that this allegation involves principles relating to freedom of association. As it has pointed out before, on receiving an allegation of this kind, the Committee would stress the importance it attaches to certain fundamental principles essential to the exercise of trade union rights, namely that occupation of trade union premises and confiscation of materials and other trade union publications may constitute serious interference by the authorities in trade union affairs. The International Labour Conference, in the Resolution concerning trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted at its th () Session, considered that the right to protection of trade union property is one of the civil liberties which is essential to the normal exercise of trade union rights. Thus, while recognising that neither trade unions nor any other association or individual can be exempt from a search of their premises, the Committee has always considered that, should such action be taken, it should occur only after a warrant has been issued by the ordinary judicial authority, when the latter is satisfied that there are serious grounds for supposing that the necessary evidence for prosecution of a crime will be found, and provided that the search is limited to the purposes for which the warrant was issued. In addition, any authorities who, during a search, exceed the powers conferred on them by law should be punished.
.The Committee therefore urges the Government to forward its observations on the events which occurred on  February  in the San Miguel premises of the trade union federation affiliated to the ICFTU, which according to the complainants was attacked by the armed forces, who also destroyed the trade union records.
.Since , numerous complaints concerning alleged violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented to the Committee by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions' International of Textile, Clothing and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions' International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries' Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL).
.The complaints submitted to the Committee include allegations referring to the Assassination, arrest, torture or disappearance of trade union officials and workers, attacks on trade union premises by the armed forces, threats and the destruction of trade union files. The contents of the complaints were successively transmitted to the Government as they were received.
.The Committee has examined Cases Nos. , ,  and  at previous meetings and has presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.At its session in May , the Committee decided to adjourn its examination of Cases Nos. ,  and  since it had not yet received the detailed information which had been requested from the Government. At its session of November , the Committee once again adjourned its examination of these cases for the same reason and included them in its report under the heading ""Urgent appeals"". At its February  session, the Committee also included Cases Nos. ,  and  under the same heading ""Urgent appeals"" since the Government had failed to provide any detailed information. While noting with concern the troubled situation in El Salvador, the Committee pointed out to the Government that in accordance with the procedural rules currently in force, it could present a report on the substance of the cases pending even if the Government's observations had not been received.
.Given the extremely serious nature of most of the complaints, and since the Government had not provided sufficiently detailed information on the cases pending, the Committee decided at its May  session to apply the procedure contained in paragraphs  and  of its th Report. In accordance with this procedure, the Government was immediately informed that the Chairman of the Committee would make contact, on behalf of the Committee, with representatives of the Government of El Salvador at the th Session of the International Labour Conference in order to draw attention to the various cases in question and discuss the reasons for the delay in the transmission of replies to the allegations contained in these various cases.
.In accordance with the decision adopted by the Committee at its session in May , the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Security of El Salvador, Mr. Julio Alfredo Samayoa, on  June. The Chairman of the Committee explained the purpose of the meeting. The Minister of Labour stated that his Government's delay in replying to the Committee on the cases pending had been due to the unsettled situation through which his country had been passing for some time and that it was in no way the result of any lack of co-operation by his Government with the ILO and in particular with its supervisory bodies. He then transmitted a communication containing the observations of his Government on these cases, including annexes on Cases Nos.  and . The Minister added that he was prepared to provide any other information which the Committee on Freedom of Association considered necessary.
.Furthermore, the Government had already furnished certain comments on some of the allegations in communications dated , ,  and  May .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Government states that, the Act which was applied to the case of the ""El Len"" factory (Case No. ) - in which an attack by the police led to the death of two persons - has since been repealed. The Government adds that the investigations which were supposedly ordered by the Government in power at that time did not, for reasons which are unknown, produce any results. The Government states that it considers itself free of any responsibility since the matter concerns acts allegedly committed by the previous Government, with which",0,1980,El Salvador
349,"referred to in Case No. , the Committee requests the Government to undertake as soon as possible - if it has not already done so - an independent judicial inquiry into these allegations with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to keep the Committee informed of the results as and when available, of these investigations and those currently under way. The Committee is also of the view that special measures should be taken with a view to guaranteeing the personal security of those persons who are more directly involved in the trade union movement.
.As regards trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested or who have disappeared, the Committee notes that Francisco Girn Ramos has now been set free and that in principle a decision will be issued on his possible guilt on the charge of destroying authentic documents, which will be communicated to the Committee. The Committee also notes that the arrests referred to in Case No.  were the result of an illegal strike in the Rio Lempa Hydroelectric Company which led to the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. However, the Committee notes that the Government has not specified the reasons or circumstances which led to the arrest of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, whose present whereabouts are unknown, the arrest of the two members of the National Association of Workers of the Ministry of Agriculture who accompanied Jos Flix Minero on  May  when the latter was assassinated (Case No. ) and that of trade union leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro who, according to the complainants, were arrested as they were discussing a list of demands in the premises of the Buses Ruta Urbanos - undertaking and whose present whereabouts are unknown (Case No. ). In this respect, since no information is available on the present situation of the persons mentioned above, and in particular as to whether proceedings have been instigated against them, the Committee cannot but recall that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at the earliest possible moment, and point out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no grounds for conviction are subsequently found may involve the restriction of trade union rights and a serious interference with trade union activities. The Committee requests the Government to indicate the motives and circumstances which led to the arrests of the above-mentioned persons and to furnish information on their present situation. More generally, the Committee considers that a contribution would be made towards normalising the trade union situation and labour relations - a necessary objective within the context of the full respect of human rights - and the restoration of social harmony if the Government examined the situation of the arrested persons to whom the complainants refer, with a view to freeing those who may have been arrested for trade union reasons.
.Furthermore, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the threats made against trade unionists and trade union leaders (Cases Nos.  and ), the attack by the armed forces on the premises of FESINCONSTRANS and the destruction of the files of this trade union organisation. The Committee requests the Government to furnish its observations on these matters.",0,1980,El Salvador
350,"example, Fourth Report, Case No.  (United Kingdom/Malaya), para.  stressed the importance which it attaches to all detained persons receiving a fair trial at the earliest possible moment. The Committee considers that measures of preventive detention should be limited to very short periods intended solely to facilitate the course of a judicial inquiry. [See rd Report, Case No.  (Argentina), para. .]
.The Committee has examined these cases on several occasions, most recently at its November  meeting when it submitted an interim report to the Governing Body. Subsequently, the Government sent further information in a communication dated  March .
.El Salvador has not ratified either the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.Since the Government supplied no information on this aspect of the case in November , the Committee reiterated its request that the Government communicate its observations concerning the alleged killing of Toms Rosales and wounding of four other trade unionists on  June  at the undertaking of El Grarjero S. A.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government does not refute any of these allegations but merely repeats the information submitted on  September , to the effect that, on  June , Carlos Hernndez was arrested for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the undertaking's property and that he was subsequently released on  June .
.The Committee again notes this information. It observes, however, that the Government does not deny the allegations of the complainant.
.In the circumstances, the Committee can only deplore the alleged violent death of the union leader, Toms Rosales, and the injuries inflicted by the armed forces on other Granja Santa Ins trade unionists on  June  in the course of a labour dispute. Given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, the committee urges the Government to take steps to prevent any loss of human life.
.The complaint presented by the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) refers to the assassination of trade union leaders. According to the WCL in a communication dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzals, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were assassinated by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight on  May  in the Jsus suburb of San Ramn in the Department of Cuscatln. The complainant further alleges that Manual Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders o the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers' Co-operative Limited, were assassinated on  June  by members of repressive forces, basing their allegations on the calibre of the bullets found near the dead bodies. It also states that Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers of the-Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, was subsequently arrested by the rural police and that his whereabouts were unknown.
.In November , the Committee noted the Government's statement that investigations were being made into the death of the four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary General of ANTMAG. The Committee emphasised the importance that the guilty parties should be tried and punished and that the Government should keep it informed of the results of the investigation and of the action taken against those responsible.
.In its reply dated  March , the Government states that the information concerning this complaint has been communicated to the relevant bodies to help them in their inquiries.
.The Committee observes that the alleged assassination of the peasant, trade unionists occurred in May and June , since when the Government has not denied the facts and states that investigations are still under way. The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied any specific information on the circumstances surrounding the alleged death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzals, Marvel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee urges the Government to transmit this information without delay. It must recall the importance in all cases involving the loss of human life of carrying out an independent judicial inquiry. As the Committee has stated in the past,' the atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue could be restored more easily once the responsibilities of those concerned have been established and the persons who have abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.
.The complaint presented by the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAI) concerns the arrest by the police on  July  of the trade union leaders Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, all of whom were arrested during a discussion of a list of grievances in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -.
.In a communication dated June , the Government stated, with respect to the arrest of members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of Workers in Transport and Allied industries in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos , that a trial was under way.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government indicates that information regarding Case No.  will be submitted separately.
.The Committee once again urges the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of this trial and, in particular, to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro cited by name by the complainants, have been released.
.In this case, the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January  o Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death on  January  of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send in the text of any judgement handed down.
.In its communication dated  March , the Government repeats its earlier statement that the trial is being held in the Fifth Criminal court, that one of the accused has been released by order of the Supreme Court and that the other has been acquitted. It adds that the judgement concerning other accused persons considered to be the actual perpetrators of the crime was handed down early in December  but that the parties concerned have lodged an appeal.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement and requests it to continue keeping it informed of developments in this case. The Committee feels that it would be of the utmost value for it to have the text of the final judgement that will be handed down.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) In general terms, the Committee once again deeply deplores the violent death of several trade union leaders and, given the fact that an independent and free trade union movement car develop only in a climate of respect for basic human rights, urges the Government to take action to prevent any loss of human life. The Committee urges the Government to transmit without delay information on the circumstances in which these trade union leaders lost their lives.(b) In Case No. , the Committee urges the Government to communicate information on the outcome of the trial concerning the arrest o members of the Executive Committee of the National Union of workers in Transport and Allied Industries, which occurred almost three years ago - on  July  - when the trade unionists concerned were discussing a list of wage claims in the premises of the undertaking Buses Ruta Urbanos -. The Committee urges the Government to indicate whether the trade unionists Tejada, Mendoza, Mrguez, Aguirre, Snchez, Fuentes and Castro, cited by name by the complainants, have been released.(c) In Case No. , the Committee notes that the trial of the presumed perpetrators of the assassination of the trade union leader, Rodolfo Viera, and of Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, two American trade",0,1980,El Salvador
351,"years' imprisonment; they had been accused of threatening national security in violation of Act No.  of  December  by participating in and leading the metalworkers' strike in support of their socio-economic claims. Nevertheless, according to the WFTU, the actions of the workers' struggle could not have endangered national security: the strike was peaceful, negotiations were going on with the employers and the civil authorities and there were not even any strike pickets.
.The WFTU states that the convicted trade unionists have lost all civil rights for ten years and thus will be unable to carry out their activities and that they are released pending a new appeal before the Supreme Military Court.
.In its communication of  May , the Government states that Luis Incio da Silva and the other leaders were brought to trial and sentenced for inciting collective disobedience of the laws, not only for having called for participation in the strike which had been declared illegal, but also for having committed injurious acts against persons and property and for having physically injured the workers who were not involved in the strike.
.According to the Government, the accused went beyond their alleged claimed objectives, openly challenging the Government, the national institutions and the established authorities, endangering social peace and national prosperity, stirring up insecurity in the community and causing serious prejudice to the country's economy, thus infringing the provisions of Act No. / which defines offences against national security.
.The Government also states that except for Jos Gicote and Jos Timteo da Silva, who were acquitted, the accused were sentenced under section , paragraph II, of Act No. / (""inciting collective disobedience of the laws"") to the following prison terms: Djalma de Souza Bon, Luis Incio da Silva, Emilson Simes de Maura and Rubens Teodoro de Arruda -  years  months; Jos Maria de Almeida, Osmar Santos de Mendona, Juraci Batista Magalhes, Manoel Anisio Gomes and Gilson Luiz Correia de Menezes -  years  months; Nelson Companholo and Wagner Lima Alves -  years. The Government adds that those convicted are at liberty pending the decision of the judicial appeal and that, if the sentences are confirmed, they would still be able to appeal to the Federal Supreme Court.
.Lastly, as concerns the allegation relating to intervention by the authorities in the trade unions, the Government states that, by a decision of  February , the Minister of State for Labour suspended the controls still existing over trade unions and named joint managements, made up of members of the various occupational categories so as to call elections within the next  days.
.The Committee notes that under section , paragraph II, of Act No. / (""inciting collective disobedience of the laws"") Djalma de Souza Bon, Luis Incio da Silva, Emilson Simes de Maura and Rubens Teodoro de Arruda were sentenced by a military court to  years and  months' imprisonment; Jos Maria de Almeida, Oscar Santos de Mendona, Juraci Batista Magalhes, Manoel Anisio Gomes and Gilson Luiz Correia de Menezes to  years and  months' imprisonment; and Nelson Companholo and Wagner Lima Alves to  years"" imprisonment. The Committee notes that Jos Gicote and Jos Timteo da Silva were acquitted and that the convicted trade union leaders are free pending the decision at second instance of the Supreme Military Court.
.The Committee, while noting the Government's statements concerning injurious acts against persons and property and the use of physical violence against workers by the convicted trade union leaders, observes that it has not specified the concrete charges which are said to be brought against each one of them and that the principal reason for the convictions appears to have been the incitement to take part in the strike declared illegal on  April .
.On the other hand, the Committee notes that the strike basically supported wage claims and that its illegality was proclaimed as a consequence of the non-submission to the compulsory arbitration award which had decided the disputed wage questions thus imposing a duty on the workers to resume work. In these circumstances, the Committee, which has on several occasions, considered that recourse to compulsory arbitration as a restriction on the right to strike is only admissible in the public service or in essential services in the strict sense (which is not the case of the metallurgical sector) considers that proceeding with the strike in question - although it had been declared illegal - does not appear to go beyond the normal scope of trade union activities and should not therefore be considered as constituting an offence, even more so in view of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Brazil, which establishes that protection against acts of anti-union discrimination shall apply against any act calculated to prejudice a worker by reason of his participation in union activities.
.Consequently, while again drawing the Government's attention to the principle that the harmonious development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strikes, the Committee hopes that the final judgement which will be handed down in the case concerning the convicted trade union leaders will take full account of the generally recognised principles on freedom of association. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of the judicial decision on appeal.
.The Committee notes with interest that by a decision of  February , the Minister of State for Labour suspended the controls still existing over trade unions and that elections will take place within  days. The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the leaders who had been removed from office can take up their functions again at the present time normally.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has still not sent the observations requested on certain allegations and accordingly requests the Government to send information on the arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, physical assaults on workers in front of trade union premises on  April  which are alleged to have resulted in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of assemblies announced by the police on  April , the arrest for a few hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and many dismissals - , according to the complainants - which are said to have taken place two days after the strike.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the National Labour Front (FNT) ( April ), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) ( April ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the International Metalworkers' Federation (IMF) ( April ), and the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) ( April). The WCL sent additional information on  April and  May , the ICFTU and IMF on  April and  May  and  February , and the FNT on  January . The Government replied by a communication of  October .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations refer to the strike by the workers of the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo from  April to  May , the primary purpose of which was to obtain wage increases and continuity of employment for a year, and which was declared illegal by the judicial authorities on  April .
.The complainants allege that many people were injured on  April as a result of violent intervention by the military police against groups of workers who were gathered together in front of the headquarters of their trade unions. According to the WFTU, several dozens of workers were injured.
.The complainants add that the authorities removed trade union leaders from office and replaced them by officials appointed by the political authorities; one of the leaders affected was Luis Incio da Silva. The FNT, for its part, alleges that the authorities placed the metalworkers' unions of Sao Bernardo and Santo Andr under control, and the WCL, in its communication of  April , alleges that trade unions were arbitrarily dissolved.
.In its communication of  April , the WCL mentions the arrest of  persons;  of these are said to have been freed a few days later, but at the date of the communication the following trade union leaders were still under arrest: Luis Incio da Silva, Devanir Ribeiro, Orlando Francelino da Motta, Jos Cicotti, Dijalma de Souza, Ernesto Cencini, Isaias Urbano de Cunha, Edevaldo Santiago de Araujo, Jos Maria de Almeida, Expdito Soares, Severino Alves da Silva and Joao Batista dos Santos. The communication from the ICFTU and IMF of  April  states that on  April about  trade unionists were still in prison, including Arnaldo Gonalves. The communication from the WCL dated  April  further alleges that a delegation of agricultural workers who wished to demonstrate their support for the strikers was also arrested, but only for a few hours.",0,1980,Brazil

.The Committee examined this case at its February and May  Sessions and presented an interim report to the Governing Body on both occasions. Subsequently, the Committee has received a communication from the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) dated  August . The Government has supplied certain observations in a communication dated  October .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations referred to the strike by the workers of the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo from  April to  May , the primary purpose of which was to obtain wage increases and continuity of employment for a year, and which was declared illegal by the judicial authorities on  April , and to the events which occurred during and after the strike: intervention by the authorities in trade unions, removal from office of trade union leaders and their replacement by civil servants, arrests of trade union leaders and the prosecution and sentencing under the National Security Act of the trade union leaders Djalma de Souza Bom, Luiz Incio da Silva, Emilson Simes de Moura, Rubens Teodoro de Arruda, Jos Maria de Almeida, Osmar Santos de Mendoga, Juraci Batista Magalhaes, Manoel Anisio Gomes, Gilson Luiz Correia de Menezes, Nelson Campanholo and Wagner Lima Alves.
.Concerning the trade union leaders mentioned above, the Committee at its May  Session, after observing that the principal reason for the convictions appeared to have been the incitement to take part in the strike declared illegal on  April  and considering that such incitement should not be considered as constituting an offence, drew the Government's attention to the fact that the harmonious development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strikes and expressed the hope that the final judgement handed down in the case concerning the convicted trade union leaders would take full account of the generally recognised principles of freedom of association. The Committee requested the Government to inform it of the outcome of the proceedings.
.As regards the other pending questions, the Committee requested the Government to indicate whether the convicted trade union leaders could again take up their functions normally and regretted that the Government had still not sent the observations requested on certain allegations, requesting it accordingly to send information on the arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, physical assaults on workers in front of trade union premises on  April , which were alleged to have resulted in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of meetings announced by the police on  April , the arrest for several hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and many dismissals - , according to the complainants - which were said to have taken place two days after the strike.
.In its communication of  August , the ICFTU states that the appeal lodged by the metalworkers' trade union leaders tried by the military court would be examined on  September .
.In its communication of  October , the Government states that on  September  the Higher Military Court accepted the plea for annulment submitted by the lawyers of the trade union leaders who had been convicted and declared the trial null and void. As a result, the proceedings must be referred back for a fresh trial to the court which originally examined the case.
.The Committee takes note of the information supplied by the ICFTU and the Government. Considering that the case against the convicted trade union leaders is to be reviewed and that the Government has not yet supplied certain observations and information requested of it, the Committee maintains the principal conclusions it reached in its previous report concerning the trade union leaders tried and the information requested.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the harmonious development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strikes.The Committee expresses the hope that the final judgement handed down in the case concerning Luiz Incio de Silva and the other convicted trade union leaders will take full account of the generally recognised principles of freedom of association and requests the Government to transmit the text of the judgement and to keep it informed of any subsequent developments in this respect.The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the trade union leaders tried are able to take up their functions normally at present and to send information on the allegations to which it has not yet replied (arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, physical assaults on workers in front of trade union premises on  April  resulting in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of meetings announced by the police on  April , the arrest for several hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and many dismissals - , according to the complainants - which took place two days after the strike).
.The Committee examined this case at its February  Session and presented an interim report to the Governing Body, Subsequently, the Committee has received a communication from the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) dated  March . The Government replied in a communication dated  May .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations referred to the strike by the workers of the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo from  April to  May , the primary purpose of which was to obtain wage increases and continuity of employment for a year, and which was declared illegal by the judicial authorities on  April , and to the events which occurred during and after the strike: intervention by the authorities in trade unions, removal from office of trade union leaders and their replacement by civil servants, arrests of trade union leaders and the prosecution under the National Security Act of union leaders.
.The Committee, having noted that the declaration of the strike's illegality was a consequence of a compulsory arbitration award that settled the disputed wage questions and imposed the termination of the work stoppage, drew the Government's attention to the principles of freedom of association in this respect.
.Referring to the intervention by the authorities in trade unions and the replacement of leaders, the Committee recalled the principle of the right of organisations to elect their representatives and to organise their administration and activities in full freedom and asked the Government to inform it of the measures taken to cease the control of the authorities over the unions.
.The Committee also noted the Government's statement that the orders for the imprisonment of the arrested leaders have been countermanded, but that the latter were still under trial and that the offences for which they might be held responsible as a result of their contempt for the decision of the Regional Labour Court were still under examination. In this connection the Committee stressed that the development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action particularly when these are penal sanctions. The Committee thus requested the Government to send information on the results of the judicial proceedings against the arrested trade union leaders.
.Lastly, the Committee requested the Government to send information on the allegations concerning which it had not replied (the arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, the physical assaults on workers in front of trade union premises on  April , which are alleged to have resulted in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of assemblies announced by the police on  April, the arrest for a few hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and the many dismissals - , according to the complainants - which are said to have taken place two days after the strike).
.In its communication of  March , the WFTU alleges that the Military Court of Sao Paulo has sentenced  trade union leaders from the metallurgical sector to many",0,1980,Brazil
353,"Committee trusts that the Government will lift these measures without delay.(b) Regarding the physical assaults said to have been perpetrated against the workers in front of their union's premises and the injuries they are said to have suffered during clashes with the police, the Committee notes the Government's assurances that these events occurred despite the efforts made and warnings given to prevent them. The Committee can only deplore that workers were injured during this labour dispute. It recalls that the use of the police force should be limited strictly to the maintenance of law and order.(c) Regarding the alleged dismissals of , workers two days after the strike, the Committee notes the Government's explanations about the turnover of labour of the order of  per cent annually in this sector. The Committee observes, however, that the Government has not denied the allegation. The Committee invites the Government to take the necessary measures for securing the reinstatement of any trade union leaders and militants dismissed following the strike in April , in order to create a climate that is more favourable for the development of sound labour relations.(d) Regarding the case referred to the federal court of the State of Sao Paulo concerning Luis Inacio da Silva and other trade union leaders who are now at liberty, the Committee, while recalling again the importance which it attaches to the right to strike as one of the essential means that must be available to workers and their organisations for promoting and defending their occupational interests, requests the Government to transmit the decision of the federal court as soon as it is handed down.
.The Committee already examined this case at its meetings in February, May and November  when it submitted interim reports to the Governing Body. Since then, the Government has sent a communication dated  March  and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL) has sent a telegram dated  April  concerning this case.
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ); it has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints in this case were lodged by the three: international trade union Confederations ICFTU, WCL and WFTU and by the National Labour Front of Brazil and the International Metalworkers' Federation and, more recently, by the CPUSTAL. The case relates to a strike called from  April to  May  by the: Sao Paulo metalworkers in connection with a labour dispute. The strike was declared illegal and suppressed by the authorities. The trade union leaders were removed from office and replaced by civil servants. Moreover, some of them, including Luis Inacio da Silva, were arrested and sentenced under the National Security Act. The case was therefore examined by the Committee several times. Those examinations showed that the trade union leader Luis Inacio da Silva and other leaders had been sentenced to imprisonment for incitement to collective disobedience of the laws. They had immediately appealed against the court's decision and had been released pending the judgement on appeal.
.When the case was last examined in November , the Government stated that the Higher Military Court had accepted the plea for annulment submitted by the convicted trade union leaders, had declared the trial null and void and had referred the proceedings back to the court which originally heard the case.
.In its interim conclusions the Committee recalled that the harmonious development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strikes, asked the Government to keep it informed of the outcome of the trial and requested it for a copy of the judgement handed down. It also asked the Government for its observations on the other allegations to which it had not yet replied (arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, physical assaults on workers at the union's headquarters on  April  resulting in injuries to dozens of persons, the prohibition on the holding of meetings announced by the police on  April , the arrest of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, and , dismissals said to have taken place two days after the strike).
.Since then, the Government has, in a reply dated  March , stated that, at a second hearing, the Military Court of Sao Paulo handed down its judgement against Luis Inacio da Silva and others on  November , again condemning the accused to the following prison sentences:- Luis Inacio da Silva to three years and six months;- Emilio Simoes de Moura to three years and six months;- Djalma de Souza Bom to three years;- Rubens Teodoro de Arruda to three years;- Juracy Batista Magalhaes to three years;- Jos Maria de Almeida to two years and six months;- Manoel Anisio Gomez to two years and six months;- Gilson Luis Correia de Menezes to two years and six months;- Osma Santos Mendona to two years;- Nelson Campanholo to two years;- Wagner Luis Alves to two years.The trade unionists Jos Cicote and Timteo da Silva were again acquitted for lack of evidence against them. The Government adds that the trade union leaders sentenced to imprisonment are at liberty since they have appealed against the sentences to a higher court..For its part, the CPUSTAL, in a telegram dated  April , has denounced the infringements of trade union freedoms committed by the Government of Brazil, in particular the prison sentences inflicted on Luis Inacio da Silva and other trade union leaders for having exercised their legitimate rights.

.However, according to information received, it appears that a Brazilian Court of Appeal overturned the sentences, stating that the Military Court which had decided them was not competent to hear the matter.
.The Committee notes that, on two occasions, the leaders of the metalworkers' union have, under section  of Act No. / respecting the security of the State, been condemned to heavy prison sentences for incitement to collective disobedience of the laws whereas in actual fact they had merely taken part in a workers', movement resulting in a peaceful strike in April-May  to secure wage increases and job security for one year. The Committee also notes that the leaders concerned have appealed against the judgements, are at liberty, and that a Brazilian Court of Appeal has apparently overturned the judicial decision, stating that the Military Court which had decided the matter was not competent.
.The Committee further recalls that the consequences of the strike led the Government to intervene in trade union affairs and to remove trade union leaders from office and replace them by civil servants.
.Furthermore, according to the allegations before the Committee, physical assaults were perpetrated against the workers in front of their union's premises on  April , agricultural workers who had come to support the metalworkers were arrested, and , persons were dismissed.
.As regards the prison sentences pronounced against  trade union leaders of the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo, including Luis Inacio da Silva, for having taken part in a strike in April-May , the Committee once again recalls that the right to strike is one of the essential means available to workers and their organisations for promoting and defending their occupational interests. The Committee requests the Government to confirm that all proceedings against Luis Inacio da Silva and the other trade union leaders have now concluded.
.As regards the other allegations to which the Government has not yet replied, the Committee again requests it for its observations concerning the dissolution of trade unions by administrative authority following the dispute, the physical assaults said to have been perpetrated against workers at their union's headquarters on  April , and the dismissal of , strikers following the dispute.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) regarding the prison sentences pronounced by the Military Court at the second hearing against  trade union leaders of the metallurgy sector of Sao Paulo, including Luis Inacio da Silva, for having taken part in a peaceful strike declared illegal by the authorities, the Committee notes that the leaders concerned have appealed and are at liberty. As it has been informed that a Brazilian Court of Appeal has apparently overturned the judicial decision, stating that the Military Court which had decided it was not competent to hear the matter, the Committee requests the Government to confirm that all proceedings against Luis Inacio da Silva and the other trade union leaders have now been concluded.(b) the Committee again requests the Government for information on the allegations to which it has not yet replied: arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, removal of trade union leaders",0,1980,Brazil

.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints in this case were lodged by the three international trade union confederations ICFTU, WCL and WFTU and by the National Labour Front of Brazil and the International Metalworkers Federation and, more recently, by the CPUSTAL. The case relates to a strike called from  April to  May  by the Sao Paulo metalworkers in connection with a labour dispute. The strike was declared illegal and suppressed by the authorities. According to the complainants, the trade union leaders were removed from office and replaced by civil servants. Moreover, some of them, including Luis Inacio da Silva, were arrested and sentenced under the National Security Act. The case was examined by the Committee several times. Those examinations showed that the trade union leader Luis Inacio da Silva and other leaders had been sentenced to imprisonment for incitement to collective disobedience of the laws. They had appealed against the court's decision and had been released pending the judgement on appeal; however, on  November  the accused had again been sentenced by the Military Court of Sao Paulo to between two and three-and-a-half years' imprisonment. Two trade unionists had been acquitted for lack of evidence against them. In its communication of  March , the Government stated that the trade union leaders sentenced to imprisonment were at liberty and had appealed again against the sentences to the Higher Military Court.
.According to information received, it appeared that a Brazilian court of appeal had quashed the sentences, stating that the military court which had pronounced them was not competent to hear the case and that all proceedings against the trade union leaders were terminated.
.Consequently, at its May  meeting, the Committee noted that, on two occasions, the leaders of the metalworkers' union had, under section  of Act No. / respecting the security of the State, been condemned to heavy prison sentences for incitement to collective disobedience of the laws whereas in actual fact they had merely taken part in a workers' movement resulting in a peaceful strike in April-May  to secure wage increases and job security for one year. The Committee noted that the leaders concerned had appealed against the judgements and were at liberty, and requested the Government to confirm that all proceedings against Luis Inacio da Silva and the other trade union leaders were now concluded.
.The Committee also requested the Government again for information on the allegations to which it had not yet replied (arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, removal of trade union leaders from office and their replacement by civil servants, physical assaults perpetrated against the workers in front of their union's premises on  April  resulting in injuries to dozens of persons, the ban on the holding of meetings announced by the police on  April , the arrest for several hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike and numerous dismissals - , according to the complainants - said to have taken place two days after the strike).
.In its reply of  October , the Government states that, on  April , the Higher Military Court referred the case of Luis Inacio da Silva and the other trade union leaders to the federal court of the State of Sao Paulo. It attaches the court's decision quashing the previous sentence on the ground of incompetence of the military court, stating that no crime had been committed against national security although there were grounds for considering that a criminal offence under ordinary law had been committed.
.On the other aspects of the case, the Government states that there is no record of any case of arbitrary dissolution of a trade union, that there were no physical assaults against workers and that if any one was injured during disturbances, whether created by strikes or not, this occurred despite the efforts made and warnings given to prevent such occurrences since the intervention or mere presence of the police was limited to a strict minimum. According to the Government, labour relations in Brazil have been extremely calm for the last three years. It also states that the holding of trade union meetings does not require police authorisation and consequently such meetings could not have been banned by the police. Lastly, it explains that in the metalworking sector of Greater Sao Paulo, in which roughly , workers are employed, the turnover of labour is usually about  per cent annually.
.The Committee notes the Government's denials regarding the allegation that trade unions were arbitrarily dissolved during the labour disputes in the metalworking sector in Sao Paulo in April . It notes however that the Government has not refuted the complainants' allegation that trade union leaders were removed from office following the dispute and replaced by civil servants.
.on this point, the Committee requests the Government to state whether the metalworkers' trade unions in the Sao Paulo area which took part in the strike in April  have since been placed under government supervision and are now managed by civil servants who have replaced the trade union leaders. Should this be the case, the Committee trusts that the Government will lift these measures without delay.
.As regards the physical assaults said to have been perpetrated against the workers in front of their union's premises on  April  and the injuries said to have been caused to dozens of workers, the Committee notes the Government's explanations that no physical assaults took place, that police intervention was limited to a minimum and that any injuries caused occurred despite the efforts made and warnings given to prevent such occurrences.
.The Committee can only deplore that workers were injured during this labour dispute. It stresses the importance which it attaches to the need to limit the intervention of the police force strictly to the maintenance of law and order.
.Regarding the , dismissals which the complainants allege to have taken place only two days after the strike, the Committee notes the Government's explanations about the normal turnover of labour in the metalworking sector of Greater Sao Paulo of the order of  per cent annually for the , workers employed in this industry. The Committee notes, however, that the Government has not refuted the allegation.
.The Committee recalls that when examining previous cases of a similar nature it has pointed out that, while it obviously does not fall within its competence to decide on the desirability of resorting to dismissals for economic reasons, acts of anti-union discrimination should not take place using such circumstances as a pretext. It has also pointed out that protection against anti-union discrimination is of special importance for workers' representatives. In cases where dismissals are alleged to have taken place because of trade union activities, the Committee has also considered it necessary to ascertain whether workers are ensured, by legislation or other measures, effective protection against any acts of anti-union discrimination, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. . In the present case, the Committee notes that section () of the Brazilian Labour Code penalises an employer found guilty of anti-union discrimination against workers exercising their trade union rights. However, the Committee also considers that the existence of legal provisions prohibiting acts of anti-union discrimination, while necessary, is insufficient unless they are accompanied by effective procedures, especially preventive procedures designed to prevent such acts. The Committee trusts that the Government will take the necessary measures for securing the reinstatement of any trade union leaders and militants dismissed for having taken part in the strike in the metalworking sector in Sao Paulo in , in order to create a climate that is more favourable for the development of sound labour relations.
.Lastly, as regards the case against Luis Inacio da Silva and the other trade union leaders who are now at liberty, which was referred to the federal court of the State of Sao Paulo, the Committee can only recall once again the importance which it attaches to the right to strike as one of the essential means that must be available to workers and their organisations for promoting and defending their occupational interests. It requests the Government to transmit the decision of the federal court of Sao Paulo as soon as it is handed down.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee requests the Government to state whether the Sao Paulo metalworkers' trade unions involved in the strike in April  have been placed under government supervision and have since then been managed by civil servants replacing the leaders removed from office.

.Before treating the questions raised by the complainant, the Committee wishes to express its concern over the gravity of certain allegations related to the death of a leader of COSEP, which the Committee profoundly deplores, and to the arrest of several employers who are leaders of private undertakings.
.In the Committee's opinion, the fact that the COSEP does not have the status of a trade union organisation in the eyes of the Nicaraguan legislation does not dispense the Government from the obligations arising from its ratification of Convention No. , in particular, to respect the freedom of the employers in Nicaragua to establish organisations of their own choosing, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes without interference from the public authorities which would restrict this.
.The Committee notes the information submitted by the Government as regards Mr. Salazar, and in particular the fact that the First Criminal Tribunal of Managua ""definitely closes the case in favour of Mr. Salazar because of his death"". The Committee nevertheless notes that the Government in its communication accuses Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello of having conspired against the Government in an armed group. It also observes that if such information refers to the alleged conspiratorial activities, it does not contain sufficient details regarding the motives and circumstances of the activities carried out by the police which resulted in the death of Mr. Salazar, in relation to which, according to the information available to the Committee, the Government has formally admitted that he was not armed at that moment. In this respect, the Committee notes that the report of the interrogation by the public prosecutor of the Assistant Director of the State Security Services does not contain a reply to question No.  concerning the circumstances of Mr. Salazar's death. The Committee also notes that the text of the decision sent by the Government does make a reference to the judicial proceedings carried out by the Second Criminal Tribunal to investigate Mr. Salazar's death, which includes testimony regarding his death, but the Committee has not received a report of these proceedings. In these circumstances the Committee, as it has done on previous occasions in considering allegations relating to death of trade unionists, can only urgently request the Government, if it has not done so already, to undertake as soon as possible an independent judicial inquiry with a view to elucidating the facts in full, determining responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties, and to communicate the results of this inquiry.
.In reference to arrests and detentions of the other leaders, the Committee has examined the text of the Court's decisions depriving them of their liberty for different time periods for their participation in conspiratorial activities, and it has also noted that they have already appealed. The Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the judicial decision of the appeal, so that it can take a decision on the allegations with full knowledge of the facts.
.As regards Decree No.  of  September , which requires approval of collective bargaining agreements by the ministry of Labour, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the requirement of approval or acknowledgement by a government authority to make an agreement valid is not in full conformity with the principle- of voluntary collective bargaining, established under Convention No. . In similar cases, the Committee has recommended the establishment of procedures such as the creation of consultative bodies, designed to ensure that the parties to collective bargaining have regard voluntarily in their negotiations to considerations relating to the economic or social policies of the Government, and the safeguarding of national interests, which in any case should utilise persuasion and not entail recourse to measures of compulsion, while conserving the freedom of both parties as regards the final decision.
.Finally, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the draft labour law on trade unions; and to the alleged FSLN pressures on the major independent trade unions to force them to join a single trade union; and to the limitation on freedom of information by prohibiting the publication of information on the death of Mr. Salazar Argello; the alleged efforts of the FSLN, with the Government's support, to divide up the COSEP; the preliminary draft of the law on regulation of professional activity and the hostility of the Government towards COSEP and its members. The Committee asks the Government to send it information regarding these allegations.",0,1980,Nicaragua
356,".The complaints are contained in a communication from the Trade Union Committee of the Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA) dated  April  and a communication from the international Federation of Commercial, Clerical and Technical Employees (FIST) dated  August . The Government replied in a communication dated  September .
.Honduras has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that under legislative decree No.  of  March  liquidating the National Development Bank (BNF) and establishing the National Agricultural Development Bank (BANADESA), the entire staff of the former were dismissed on  March  and the social benefits to which they were entitled liquidated, thus terminating all previous labour commitments, both individual and collective, contracted by BNF.
.The complainants state that the dismissal of the staff en masse is a violation of the Labour Code and the existing collective agreement, and aims in reality at destroying the BNF trade union. This is clear from the fact that its national and sectoral leaders were dismissed without any opportunity of reinstatement or possibility of defending themselves, and the fact that BANADESA has been looking for new employees. Also, the BNF staff who have gone to work for BANADESA are employed on terms vastly inferior to these enjoyed by the BNF employees under the collective agreement then in force.
.The Government states that total reorganisation of BNF had been considered at various times since the late s. The establishment of BANADESA thus sprang from the need for reorganisation that, geared to the actual requirements of the country's agricultural sector, would do away with outdated administrative procedures and an attitude on the part of the staff to resist improvement of their skills and that the said reorganisation would be able to cope with rising running costs and correct the current stagnation of the credit portfolio.
.The Government adds that the staff with whom BANADESA's operations were begun were selected from among former BNF employees according to technical requirements and their past records so that the new undertaking would be staffed by the most qualified employees. Thus,  BANADESA employees previously worked for BNF. The Government states that the establishment of BANADESA was, for the various reasons mentioned above, due to the need to develop the agricultural sector and was never intended for the petty purpose of destroying a trade union.
.The Committee notes that there is a clear contradiction between the complainants' statement that the establishment of BANADESA and the consequent dismissal of the BNF staff were intended to destroy the BNF trade union and the Government's reply that these measures obeyed strictly economic reasons and that the subsequent recruitment of BANADESA staff was based exclusively on considerations of occupational qualifications on this point, the Committee recalls that its terms of reference do not include the problem of breach of employment contract by dismissal, unless the dismissal was an act of anti-union discrimination. In this connection, the Committee takes note of the complainants' statement that, pursuant to the decree of  March  providing that BANADESA's administration would enjoy complete freedom in selecting and hiring its staff, the national and sectoral leaders of the BNF Trade Union, were dismissed without any opportunity of being reinstated in BANADESA or any possibility of defending themselves. The Committee wishes to point out that in such circumstances workers who consider themselves prejudiced by anti-union discriminatory measures should be able to appeal to a court or some other independent authority. The Committee also notes that the Labour Code of Honduras forbids employers to dismiss or prejudice in any way their workers on account of trade union membership or participation it lawful trade union activities.
.Furthermore, the Committee considers that for the sake of sound labour relations it would have been advantageous for the employers and workers to discuss jointly such matters as the way in which BNF was to be reorganised, the continuing application of the provisions of the collective agreement, or the implementation of impartial procedures to ensure that workers entering BANADESA would be selected according to objective criteria, all of which should have been done in the light of the Co-operation at the Level of the Undertaking Recommendation,  (No. ).
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to draw the attention of the Government to the importance, as stressed it the two last paragraphs, of observing the principles relating to co-operation between employers and workers at the level of the undertaking and to those relating to protection against anti-union discrimination, in particular the principle that workers who feel that they have been the subject of discriminatory measures, should be able to appeal to a court or some other independent authority in order to secure the application of section () of the Labour Code of Honduras expressly forbidding employers to dismiss or prejudice in any way their workers on account of trade union membership or participation in lawful trade union activities.",0,1980,Honduras

.Haiti has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.By communications dated  September and  October , the Union of Haitian Workers, the headquarters of which is in New York, presented a complaint of infringement of trade union rights in Haiti. For its part the Government furnished its observations in a communication dated  November .
.Haiti has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaint of the Union of Haitian Workers concerns the disappearance of an active trade unionist. The complainant alleges in its two communications that Rmy Alexis, a member of the ""Association of Haitian Chauffeurs-Guides"" trade union, was secretly kidnapped whilst he was at the local headquarters of the abovementioned association, where his car remained parked. Inquiries undertaken to clarify the situation have proved fruitless. Rmy Alexis worked at Port-au-Prince. The complainant goes on to say that, although Mr. Alexis's car was parked in the courtyard of the Association of Chauffeurs-Guides between  and  April , no member of the office was able to give any information as concerns the date and time when the vehicle was driven to this place.
.The complainant adds that, over and above this particular case, the total absence of freedom of association constitutes a major obstacle to trade unions in Haiti: workers' organisations which operate within the country cannot maintain contact with the international unions or groups of affiliated trade unions which would be able to provide them with support affiliation of any kind is prohibited under the policy of the Government.
.In its reply, the Government states that it has reported the facts concerning the disappearance of Rmy Alexis to the steering Committee of the Association of Chauffeur-Guides of Haiti of which the missing trade unionist was a member. Attached to its reply the Government supplies the explanations given by this association on  October  indicating that the latter was informed of the disappearance of the missing trade unionist by members of his family and that it knew nothing of the circumstances in which Mr. Alexis had disappeared. Indeed, no member of the association had witnessed the disappearance, which could not have taken place at the local headquarters of the organisation without the knowledge of the trade union officials. However, although the association hopes that the competent authorities which are pursuing their inquiries will be able to clarify the situation, it maintains that the affair can in no way be connected with any infringement of trade union rights.
.The Government for its part states that it has informed the Ministry of the Interior and National Defence of the complaint and that it will transmit any reply which it receives on the case. The Government has not noted any instance of discrimination against this active trade unionist on account of his trade union activities.
.The Committee notes that, although the Association of Chauffeurs-Guides of Haiti of which the victim was a member states that it knows nothing of the circumstances of the disappearance, it affirms that it is not a trade union matter. However, since the Government has indicated that it will transmit any report which is received from the Ministry of the Interior and National Defence on the matter, the Committee wishes to be kept informed of any development in the situation which may occur.
.Further, the Committee notes that the Government does not provide any information on the allegation that the trade union organisations operating within the country may not remain in contact with international trade unions or groups of affiliated unions.
.In the circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adopt the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of any development in the situation concerning the disappearance of Rmy Alexis.The Committee also requests the Government to furnish its observations on the allegations concerning the difficulties encountered by the trade unions as regards their affiliation and contacts with international trade union organisations.",0,1980,Haiti
358,".The Committee has examined this case on various occasions (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to ; th Report, paras.  to ; and rd Report, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th, st and th Sessions in May-June , November  and February-March  respectively), most recently at its May  meeting (see th Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in May-June ), when it presented an interim report. The Government sent certain information by a communication of January .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the Committee examined the case at its May  meeting it made the following recommendations in respect of the allegation that remained pending (relating to the death of Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of the Managing Board of Private Enterprises (COSEP)):(a) The Committee expresses its surprise at the contradiction between the judgment of  March  (according to which the Vice-President of COSEP, Mr. Jorge Salazar, fired first against the state security patrol and died in the ensuing exchange of fire) and the Government's two communications, dated respectively before and after this judgement (in which it is explicitly and implicitly recognised that Mr. Salazar was unarmed at the time of the events); this all the more so since the judgement was only transmitted by the Government nearly two years after being handed down. It urges the Government to explain this contradiction and this delay.(b) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the judgement of  March  is considered final and whether there was a possibility to appeal this decision or whether it was subject to automatic review.
.As regards the contradiction referred to by the Committee in paragraph (a) of the recommendations which it made at its May  meeting, the Government states that the remarks of a government official, even of a minister, cannot be regarded as incontrovertible evidence; still less can they be compared with the legal force of a judgement handed down by a court containing a statement made by one of the principal protagonists in the events concerned. Only those who were present at the place at which the facts occurred can attest to what took place there. According to the Government, Mr. Moncada Lau, Mr. Salazar's chief accomplice, clearly establishes in his statement that the latter was armed and that, out of an instinct of self-preservation (according to the words used by Mr. Moncada Lau himself) he opened fire on the patrol under the impression that it belonged to the State Security Services, undoubtedly motivated by the full knowledge of the offence which he was committing at that moment, namely the illicit transport of arms.
.The Government nevertheless observes that the fact of Mr. Salazar's being armed or unarmed is a detail which it is not for the Committee to examine; this is a penal matter whose constituent elements have to be analysed by the courts of law of the land for the purpose of passing judgement.
.The Government also states that the judgement passed in the case of Mr. Salazar clearly proves that the case involves problems of the country's internal policy, and that a group of individuals led by Jorge Salazar were organising a conspiracy against the Government and its authorities. In no country could Mr. Salazar's activities at that time have been described as activities in defence of occupational interests. To admit that the illicit transport of arms and conspiring against the Government are aims of either workers' or employers' organisations would lead one onto very dangerous ground, would totally vitiate the spirit of Convention No.  and would consequently enable organisations to depart from their basic aims. The Government considers that the facts referred to in no way constitute a violation of its undertakings regarding freedom of association.
.Lastly, in response to the Committee's request for information, the Government states that the possibility of an appeal existed, as was established in the judgement of  March . Nevertheless, since the defendant did not have recourse to this means of redress within the legal time-limit, the judicial authority ruled that the judgement was final; it thus had the authority of a decided case. In any case, the Nicaraguan system does not provide for automatic review before a higher instance.
.The Committee notes that the Government, in its reply of January , fully endorses the version of the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP, accepted by the judicial authority in its judgement of  March , namely that Mr. Salazar was the first to fire against the state security patrol following which he lost his life. The Committee also observes that the Government gives a contradictory version of the facts originally given by it, according to which Mr. Salazar was unarmed at the time the events took place, stating that the comments of a government official, even a minister, cannot be regarded as incontrovertible evidence, still less be compared with the legal force of a judgement handed down by a court.
.As regards the Government's statement that it is not for the Committee to examine whether Mr. Salazar was armed or unarmed, the Committee must stress that an examination of the circumstances surrounding this death is, on the contrary, essential in determining the facts with precision and in reaching a fully informed decision on the allegations made.
.The Committee notes and expresses its surprise that the Government has retracted its statements which had been previously made by the Minister of the Interior, regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Salazar Argello. At the same time it deplores that the Government has not given any reasons for the long delay in sending the judgement of  March  concerning the death of Mr. Salazar, which the Government only transmitted almost two years after it was handed down. In these circumstances the Committee considers that the continuing climate of uncertainty and doubt regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Salazar cannot but have a detrimental influence on labour relations and on the trust which must prevail in occupational organisations if freedom of association is to be exercised.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that the possibility of appealing against the judgement of  March  existed, but that since the defendant made no use of this possibility the judgement remained final.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report, and in particular the following conclusions:(a) The Committee deplores that the Government has not given any reasons for the long delay in sending the judgement of  March  respecting the death of Mr. Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP, which the Government only transmitted almost two years after it was handed down.(b) The Committee notes and expresses it surprise that the Government has retracted its statements previously made by the Minister of the Interior regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Salazar.(c) In these circumstances the Committee considers that the continuing climate of uncertainty and doubt regarding the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Salazar cannot but have detrimental influence on labour relations and on the trust which must prevail among occupational organisations if freedom of association is to be exercised.
.The Committee has examined this case on various occasions [see th Report of the Committee, paras. - and th Report, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th and st Sessions in May-June  and November , respectively]; it last examined this case at its February-March meeting in  [see rd Report of the Committee, paras. -, approved by the Governing Body at its th Session in February-March ] at which time it submitted an interim report. The Government submitted some information in a communication dated  February , received by the Office after the Committee's February-March  meeting.
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the Committee's most recent examination of the case, the allegation concerning the death of Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of the Managing Board of Private Enterprises (COSEP) remained pending. The Committee made the following recommendation on this matter to the Governing Body: ""The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied the text of the judgment handed down by the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of the employer leader, Salazar Argello, which was handed down some time ago; it urges the Government to transmit its judgment at an early date."" (See rd Report of the Committee, para. .

359,"unionists representing the AFI-CIC in El Salvador, is still under way. The Committee once again requests the Government to continue communicating detailed information on the case, including the text of the final judgement once it has been handed down.
.Since  numerous complaints concerning violations of freedom of association in El Salvador have been presented by the following organisations: the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador (FUSS), the Federation of Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries of El Salvador (FESTIAVTSCES), the Committee for Trade Union Unity of Workers of Central America and Panama (CUSCA), the Trade Unions International of Textile, Clothing, Leather and Fur Workers, the Trade Unions International of Food, Tobacco, Hotel and Allied Industries Workers, the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the World Federation of Agricultural Workers, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL).
.The Committee has already examined most of these cases on several occasions and submitted interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then, in the absence of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned its examination of these cases to February, then May . The Office sent a telegram to the Government on  April  inviting it to submit its observations as soon as possible. In June  the Minister of Labour forwarded additional information.
.El Salvador has not ratified either the freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), or the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints examined by the Committee were basically of three kinds: first, concerning the violent death and disappearance of trade unionists and former trade unionists; second, arrest of trade union leaders; third, attack on trade union premises and destruction of records.
.At the last examination of the cases in question, in November , the Governing Body, in accordance with the Committee's recommendations, expressed extreme concern at the serious nature of the allegations and observed that various acts had occurred after  October , when the previous Government had been deposed.
.In particular, concerning violent deaths and disappearances, the Governing Body deplored the loss of many human lives and the injuries referred to in the complaints. It noted that investigations had been opened into some of the occurrences and requested the Government to undertake as soon as possible a judicial inquiry into those cases where investigations had not been opened and to inform it of the results.
.In his communication of June , before giving a detailed reply concerning the cases in question, the Minister of Labour stated that, as a human being and as an official, he regretted that in the past acts had occurred in El Salvador which were not perhaps compatible with humane feelings, especially as regards violations of freedom of association such as those denounced to the International Labour Organisation. However, in order to preserve his country's international prestige despite the climate of violence which has prevailed in recent years, resulting in loss of human life and material losses, he stated that he would like to present specific information on the current situation concerning these cases.
.It should therefore be recalled that, in Case No. , the complainants alleged in particular that on  October , workers who were preparing to organise a collection in support of a strike at the El Len factory were attacked by the police, and two of them lost their lives. According to the Government's communication of June , the investigations undertaken and requested from the Ministry of Defence and Public Security confirm that there is no file on events relating to the situation of trade unionists in the El Len factory which occurred under the presidential administration of Colonel Arturo Armando Molina and General Carlos Humberto Romero in  and .
.As regards Case No. , according to a communication of the WCL dated  April , Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, were murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard at midnight, on  May , in the Jsus suburb of the San Ramn municipality in the department of Cuscatln. In addition, Manuel Antonio Carrillo and Jos Antonio Carrillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Co-operative Ltd., were murdered on  June  by members of the forces of repression, as was evident from the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. As regards Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of workers of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cattle Farming (ANTMAG), who had been transported to the Metapn hospital after being injured in an accident, he had subsequently disappeared, having been arrested by the hacienda police.
.Concerning the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo, and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo, the Government states that the authorities are continuing their investigations.
.In Case No. , the ICFTU alleged, in a communication dated  July , that in a clash with the armed forces on  June , Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union of the ""Granja Santa Ins"", had been killed and four other trade unionists had been injured, when the workers at this undertaking had called a peaceful strike in support of a list of wage claims.
.The Government has still not supplied any information on this allegation.
.In Case No. , concerning the murder on  January  of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and the death of two United States trade unionists Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, the Government confirms in its communication of June  that a trial was being held in the fifth criminal court of San Salvador. The accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, has been released on the order of the Supreme Court, after submitting an appeal, and the other accused, Hans Krist, has been acquitted, adds the Government.
.The Committee observes that the Government has supplied certain information on the development of the investigations conducted by the authorities into the death and disappearance of the trade unionists and former trade unionists referred to by the complainants.
.As regards certain events, however, the Committee regrets that despite the time which has elapsed since the complaints were presented, the Government still has not supplied any observations, particularly on the alleged death of Toms Rosales and the injuries inflicted on his fellow workers by the forces of the law on  June  at the Granja Santa Ins. In this respect, the Committee recalls, as it has stated on numerous previous occasions, that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact. It is therefore confident that if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the latter should recognise the importance for the protection of their own good name of formulating for objective examination detailed factual replies to the allegations put forward,
.In Case No. , the Committee notes that, according to the Government, an investigation is being made into the homicide of the peasants Jos Santos, Pedro Gonzles, Manuel Carrillo and Antonio Carrillo and the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. The Committee again stresses to the Government the need to ensure that the guilty parties are punished and insists that the Government inform it of the results of the current investigations and of the penalties imposed.
.The Committee also notes that in Case No. , the trial in the murder of trade union leader Rodolfo Viera has resulted in the acquittal of one of the accused and that the second has been released pending appeal. In this connection, the Committee must first keenly deplore the murder of these trade unionists. It would also observe that a climate of violence such as that in which the murders were committed constitutes a serious obstacle to the exercise of trade union rights. Consequently, such acts call for effective measures on the part of the authorities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send it the text of any judgement handed down in this case, and to pursue actively the investigations into these cases.
.During its most recent examination of the substance of these cases, the Committee had also recommended the Governing Body to note that some trade unionists had been released, and had noted that certain arrests were made because of participation in an illegal electricity strike which led to the loss of human lives in hospitals and other welfare centres.
.However, it had also requested the Government to indicate the reasons for and circumstances surrounding the arrests of the leaders Enrique Tejada, Antonio Campos Mendoza, Salomn Snchez Mrquez, Vicente Aguirre, Melitn Snchez, Antonio Fuentes and Maximiliano Castro, and to supply information on their present situation. Recalling that it should be the policy of every government to ensure the right of all detained persons to receive a fair trial at",-1,1980,El Salvador
360,"of Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello.
.In its judgment, the above-mentioned Court ruled the following:The present case concerning the alleged offence of homicide against Jorge Salazar Argello about whom no details are provided in the present proceedings, with which Javier del Carmen Gonzlez, Garcia, Francisco Javier Rodriguez Daz and Pedro Jos Andino Villalobos are charged, is stayed - all three persons concerned are of age, soldiers in active service, of whom the first is unmarried and the second married, all living in this same locality - since it has been proved that they were fulfilling their duty and acting in observance of a right, authority or duty and, furthermore, acting in legitimate self-defence; it is therefore ruled that these said persons shall be immediately released.
.Amongst the grounds for the judgment were the following:... It would seem from evidence that on  November , at El Crucero, the deceased Salazar Argello met Nstor Omar Moncada Lau with a view to supervising the handing over of some weapons that Salazar was transporting in a Cherokee truck, allegedly his own, so that he might assist criminal actions against the Revolutionary State; it was for this reason that the truck had two sets of number plates, one on top of the other; Salazar Argello and Moncada Lau were involved in this handing over of weapons when they suddenly saw a patrol drawing up in front of the Esso petrol station in El Crucero, where they were carrying out this operation; this patrol was made up of the above-mentioned persons striving to maintain the integrity of our struggle on behalf of the population; immediately fire was opened against the vehicle transporting the said patrol, which was forced to repulse the attack to which it was subjected and, in the exchange of fire, Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello was killed. We have not come upon any evidence whatsoever in this case which might lead this Court to doubt that Moncada Lau and Salazar Argello were the first to start firing against the police patrol; the same Nstor Moncada Lau, who assisted Salazar in his illegal activities, gave added credence to this supposition in his statement to the Military Examining Magistrate, made at . a.m. Friday,  July ; his version of the facts was spontaneously and voluntarily given. He adds that when they were discovered, they were in the process of transferring six M- firearms and an unspecified number of magazines from Salazar Argellos's vehicle to the one that he himself, Moncada Lau, was driving; at the time and place decided upon with Salazar, the latter arrived, parking his Cherokee truck alongside Moncada Lau's Toyota car, behind the ESSO petrol station in the above-mentioned locality, so that their criminal actions might be concealed from the eyes of any onlookers who might discover what was happening. Moncada Lau continues by saying that he had just started transferring the weapons to the Cherokee truck, which Salazar was driving, when a vehicle arrived transporting soldiers, presumably members of the State Security Services; at this moment, Salazar was at the wheel of the Cherokee truck, ready to return to the farm on his estate, which is in the neighbourhood of El Crucero, as soon as the arms had been handed over; his instinct of self-preservation prompted him to pull out the firearm he was carrying, duly loaded, and he started to fire against the state security patrol. The latter, finding itself attacked, was obliged to respond and, in the ensuing exchange of fire, Salazar Argello was killed. This incident, highly regrettable for the suffering it has caused to his family and friends, can only be attributed to the desperate action taken by Moncada Lau and Salazar in their attempt to escape unharmed from the counter-revolutionary activities in which they were involved to try and destroy the Revolutionary State, so that they might regain their lost privileges; this had even led them to try and destroy our system by dealing illegally in weapons and in giving instruction on their use; consequently, the accused Javier del Carmen Rodriguez Garca, Francisco Javier Rodriguez Diaz and Pedro Jos Andino Villalobos were only fulfilling their duty as members of the state security forces and were legally exercising their right as soldiers entrusted with protecting and maintaining law and order both inside and outside the Republic; viewed from this standpoint, their action was perfectly within the provisions pertaining to the exoneration of criminal responsibility laid down in clause  of section  of the Criminal Code, thus making the charge of criminal responsibility inadmissible, since all their actions took place within a justifiable framework.Even supposing that the accused were not fulfilling their duty in repulsing the attacks made upon them by Salazar Argello and Moncada Lau and supposing that they were not exercising any right of authority, even under these circumstances, the fact that they were acting in legitimate self-defence would exonerate them from criminal responsibility; indeed, our Criminal Code stipulates that there should be three requirements, simultaneously concurrent, to qualify for this exoneration and these were all present in the events under consideration. As is well known, in order to have the principle of legitimate defence accepted, it is necessary to prove that there was an illegal assault, that there were reasonable grounds for the means used to prevent or repulse this attack and that there was no provocation on the part of the person defending himself; the statements made by Nstor Omar Moncada Lau himself and Jessi Rojas Snchez prove that these requirements were duly met in the present proceedings and the evidence leaves no doubt that the State Security Services did not attack Salazar and Moncada Lau, but that they merely repulsed the attack to which they were subjected ...
.The Committee notes the contents of the judgment handed down by the Military Court of First Instance of the Sandinista Armed Forces of  March , concerning the death of Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP. The Committee points out that in its previous report on this case, it noted that a military court was dealing with this case under section  of the Act concerning the organisation of military courts and provisional military penal proceedings, which reads as follows. ""The Military Courts shall be responsible for conducting penal proceedings in connection with any punishable act in which a number of the military personnel is implicated, even if one or more of the participants or the victims are civilians"". [See rd Report, para. .]
.In the judgment in question, the Committee notes the staying of the case ""concerning the alleged offence of homicide against Jorge Salazar Argello ... with which Javier del Carmen Gonzlez Garca, Francisco Javier Rodrguez Daza and Pedro Jos Andino Villalobos, soldiers in active service, are charged ... since it has been proved that they were fulfilling their duty and acting in observance of a right, authority or duty and, furthermore, acting in legitimate self-defence.""
.The Committee notes that it appears from the judgment that Mr. Salazar, in order to conceal criminal actions against the Revolutionary State, fired against the patrol vehicle of the state security forces which arrived when Mr. Salazar was transferring firearms (six M- rifles) from his truck to Mr. Moncada Lau's car; the members of the patrol repulsed this attack, killing Mr. Salazar in the exchange of fire which ensued. These events occurred on  November , in front of the Esso petrol station at El Crucero.
.The Committee notes that the judicial military authorities concluded that there were grounds justifying the soldiers' action in killing Mr. Salazar, especially in view of the fact that the latter has started the exchange of fire, and that this was corroborated by the version of the events given by Mr. Moncada Lau, the person accompanying Mr. Salazar at the time of his death.
.Nevertheless, the Committee would point out that, in its communication of  December , the Government stated that ""it is not certain that Mr. Salazar died as a result of an ambush set by the police. He was killed when he was about to be captured with his companion, who shot first with a firearm at the authorities who were proceeding to arrest him; thus an exchange of fire was started resulting, unfortunately, in the death of Mr. Salazar Argello ..."".It also notes that, in its communication of  September  (received by the ILO on  October ), the Government stated that ""even if it was certain that Jorge Salazar was unarmed at the time of the events - as was admitted by Commander Toms Borge - the truth is that six M- automatic weapons were in his truck which were intended for Moncada Lau ..."".
.In view of the contradiction between the judgment of the Military Court of First Instance of the Sandinista Armed Forces of  March  (according to which Mr. Salazar opened the exchange of fire) and the above-mentioned communications from the Government (in which it both implicitly and explicitly recognised that Mr. Salazar was unarmed at the time of",0,1980,Nicaragua
361,"Mojarras (Department of Len) and to indicate exactly in which locality the five leaders of the Union of Workers of the Hacienda El Progreso were dismissed on  January  and prevented from returning to work despite a court order to reinstate them (according to the Government, there are over a hundred plantations under the name of ""El Progreso"").(c) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations to which it has not replied, involving the union leader Hermgenes Aguirre Largaespada and trade unionist Larry Lee Shoures and the arrest of trade unionist Abelino Gonzlez, Piz.Case No. (a) Since there is no record of any charges having been brought against the persons concerned, the Committee regrets that four union leaders should have been held in custody for a long time and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the preventive detention of union leaders entails a serious risk of interference in the activities of trade union organisations.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the Government, the trade union leader Salomn Daz Fernndez is being held for counter-revolutionary activities and requests the Government to indicate whether he is still in custody and to specify the precise charges brought against him.
.The Committee examined this case at its meeting in may  and submitted an interim report to the Governing Body.
.Subsequently, the complainant sent additional information in communications dated  October and  November . The Government replied in communications of October and  December  and  October . In accordance with the procedure in force, in view of the contradiction between the allegations and the Government's observations contained in its communication of October , these observations were sent to the complainant organisation for its comments. The comments thus received were forwarded to the Government.
.Nicaragua has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.  ).
.As regards the allegation concerning the death of Jorge Salazar Argello, vice-President of COSEP, the Committee takes note of the statements of the complainant and of the Government, and of the judgement of the Supreme Court of Justice of  October . The Committee notes in particular that the above-mentioned judgement states that ""court records show that a criminal court is investigating the persons responsible for his death; the case had originally been investigated by a criminal tribunal and was taken over by the military court because of the military status of the persons responsible"". Therefore, in keeping with its previous conclusions, the Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgement of the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello. The Committee also requests the Government to indicate in virtue of what legal text a military court was dealing with this matter.
.As regards the allegation concerning the arrests and prison sentences of enterprise managers, the Committee observes that the Court of Appeal quashed the verdict of guilty pronounced by the court of first instance on Francisco Castillo Molina and handed down a conditional sentence on Gabriel Lacayo Benard for a probation period of two years, requiring him to submit a mortgage guarantee to the Treasury and ordering him to be on good behaviour. The Committee notes in addition that the Supreme Court of Justice on  October  closed the case definitively in favour of the accused Dora Maria Lau de Lacayo, Leonardo Ramn Somarriba Gonzlez, Alejandro Jos Salazar Elizondo, Mario Hannon Talavera and Luis Adolfo Valle Lau, charged with crimes against the Act on preservation of order and public security. The Committee notes also that the judgement orders the first criminal tribunal of Managua to institute criminal proceedings for the crimes against the internal security of the State, conspiracy and other resulting crimes against all those whose cases have been closed, since there are sufficient presumptions, clues and investigations to lead to the conclusion that acts constituting such crimes may exist. In these circumstances, the Committee can only ask the Government to send the text of the decision handed down on the case by the first criminal tribunal of Managua.
.As regards the allegation concerning the Bill on trade union associations, the Committee notes that, according to the Government, this Bill was drawn up privately by an official of the Ministry of Labour, who handed copies to some persons for their opinion, and therefore was not an official Bill. In this respect, taking account of the Government's statements and considering that since the complainant formulated this allegation ( January ) the Bill in question does not appear to have reached the competent authorities for adoption, the Committee considers that this allegation does not require further examination.
.With respect to the violations of freedom of information, the Committee observes that the complainant referred to Decree No. , to a communiqu of the Ministry of the Interior ordering that before disseminating news about the armed confrontation in which Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello was killed, the sources stipulated in Decree No.  must be consulted, and to the closure on five occasions of the newspaper ""La Prensa"", which frequently echoes the views expressed by COSEP.
.As regards Decree No. , although it takes note of the Government's statements thereon and observes that the Decree is applied generally and not exclusively to the trade union field, the Committee considers that its application to the dissemination of news concerning the armed confrontation in which Mr. Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP, was killed - as well as the retaliatory measures taken against the newspaper ""La Prensa"" for having reported this - have restricted the exercise of trade union rights. , The Committee so considers because it has pointed out on previous occasions that the publication and distribution of news and information of trade union interest constitutes a legitimate trade union activity and the application of measures for their control may involve a serious interference by the administrative authorities. The Committee also points out to the Government the importance which it attaches to the Resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th () Session.
.Concerning the efforts of the National Sandinista Liberation Front (FSLN), supported by the Government, to divide COSEP, the Committee notes that, according to the complainant, the Government does not allow pluralism to develop within employers' organisations, but sets up its own organisations dependent on it, as is shown by FSLN interference by promoting parallel pseudo-official organisations which it attempts to substitute for the organisations of the private sector. According to the complainant, this was the case of the Confederation of Occupational Associations, Heroes and Martyrs (APHM) and of the National Association of Agriculturists and Stock-breeders (ANAL): the former had taken away a seat in the council of State from the (independent) Confederation of Occupational Associations, which groups together most of Nicaragua's professional workers; the latter had been given two seats in the Council of State, despite the fact that the organisation which truly represents the agricultural and fishery sector is the Union of Agricultural and Fishery Producers. The Committee also takes note of the Government's statements that trade union pluralism is one of the principles of the Revolution and its denial that the Government attempts to divide COSEP, although priority is given to the task of organising co-operatives, collectives, etc., in the sectors which previously did not enjoy the benefits of economic activity. The Committee observes, however, that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegation concerning interference of the FSLN by promoting parallel pseudo-official organisations (CAPHM and ANAL, for example) which had taken away seats in the Council of State from organisations of the private sector. The Committee therefore asks the Government to send its observations on this matter.
.Concerning the preliminary draft of the law on professional activities, having analysed its provisions the Committee considers that this preliminary draft regulates questions which lie outside the scope of Conventions on freedom of association, as it confines itself to regulating access to the various occupations listed, the exercise of these occupations and the organisations and bodies competent in these matters. The Committee notes further that, to judge from the Government's statements and from the preamble to the text of the preliminary draft sent by the complainant, this preliminary draft is undergoing a phase of consultations between the persons and organisations directly involved. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this allegation does not call for further examination.
.Lastly, concerning pressure on independent trade unions to destroy them and force them to join a single trade union confederation, the Committee observes that, although the complainant referred to discrimination, violent attacks on trade union leaders, assaults on trade union confederation premises and against trade union meetings, it has not cited any specific cases of such violations of freedom. Therefore, taking account of the fact that the Government has denied such allegations, the Committee considers that they do not call for",0,1980,Nicaragua
362,"further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and in particular the following conclusions:(a) Concerning the death of Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP, the Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgement of the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of this employer leader, and to indicate in virtue of what legal text a military court was dealing with this matter.(b) As regards the allegation concerning the arrest and prison sentences of employer leaders:(i) the Committee notes that the Court of Appeal has quashed the verdict of guilty pronounced by the court of first instance against Francisco Castillo Molina and handed down a conditional sentence on Gabriel Lacayo Benard for a probation period of two years;(ii) the Committee notes also that the Supreme Court of Justice has closed the cases of the rest of the accused charged with crimes against the Act on preservation of order and public security, who were tried by courts of the first and second instance. However, the Supreme Court of Justice has ordered the court of first instance to institute criminal proceedings for crimes against the security of the State and other crimes. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgement handed down on this matter by the court of first instance.(c) Concerning the violations of freedom of information, the Committee considers that the application of Decree No.  to the dissemination of news concerning the armed confrontation in which Mr. Salazar Argello, Vice-President of COSEP, was killed - as well as the retaliatory measures taken against the newspaper ""La Prensa"" which reported this - have restricted the exercise of trade union rights. The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the publication and distribution of news and information of trade union interest constitutes a legitimate trade union activity and the application of measures for their control may constitute a serious interference by the administrative authorities. The Committee also points out to the Government the importance it attaches to the Resolution on trade union rights and their relation to civil liberties, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its th () Session.(d) Concerning the efforts of the FSLN, supported by the Government, to divide COSEP, the Committee observes that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegation concerning FSLN interference by promoting parallel pseudo-official organisations (CAPHM and ANAL) which took away seats in the Council of State from organisations of the private sector. Therefore, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter.(e) Concerning the rest of the allegations, the Committee considers that they do not require further examination.
.By a communication dated  November , the international Organisation of Employers presented its complaint, and sent additional information on  January . The Government furnished its observations on  November  and on  January .
.Nicaragua has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The International Organisation of Employers (IOE) alleges that on  November , Mr. Jorge Salazar Argello, Vice-President of the Managing Board of Private Enterprises (COSEP), while unarmed, was shot down by the police during an ambush, a few moments after presiding over a meeting of COSEP. According to the complainant, which categorises this event as murder, no serious argument has been advanced in support of the accusations made by the Government against Mr. Salazar (transporting of weapons, membership in an insurgent movement whose aim was to re-establish the Somoza regime, and procurement of aid from abroad for this purpose).
.Whilst referring to violations in Nicaragua of civil liberties which are essential for the exercise of trade union rights, the complainant gives particular emphasis to the events relating to the death of Mr. Salazar. According to the complainant, the right to a fair trial before an independent judicial body was not applied in Mr. Salazar's case; for instance, the court which convicted eight alleged members of participating in a counterrevolutionary plot, and absolved others, decided to ""close definitively the case in favour of Jorge Salazar Argello because of his death"", without resolving either the doubt over what really happened on  November , or the question of his leadership of the plot. The alleged proofs come from statements of journalists and detainees (the latter obtained in prison), from verbal testimony by one member of the police, and from written testimony by a civil servant who did not appear at the trial.
.With reference to the exercise of free speech, the complainant argues further that the Government had decided that the murder of Mr. Salazar was to be categorised as having occurred during ""an armed conflict"" and could not be reported by any media (press, radio, etc.), without a prior veracity check by government services as provided for in Decree No.  of  September .
.In its communication of  November  the International Organisation of Employers cites the imprisonment of various leaders of private enterprises. The IOE indicates that the arrests and detentions which occurred after the change of regime have not ceased, and that section  of the Decree on Rights and Guarantees of the Nicaraguans denies the right of habeas corpus for certain crimes (""alleged or real crimes committed during the Somoza period"").
.The IOE also alleges that the Government tolerates and favours the pressure brought by the FSLN (National Sandinista Liberation Front) to force the major independent trade unions to join the single central trade union. The IOE refers, in an appendix, to the provisions of draft labour law on professional associations, which would establish that trade union policy should be oriented towards avoiding the proliferation of trade union organisations; prohibit the formation of other trade unions if there already existed one in a particular industry or economic activity; establish a Single Central organisation of workers for urban workers and rural workers; and would establish trade unions only for workers, whereas Convention No.  also guarantees to employers the right of association.
.As far as the employers and independent professions are concerned, the IOE alleges that the FSLN, with the Government's support, is trying to divide up the COSEP in organising small and medium-sized undertakings, and is doing the same with independent professions. In particular, the IOE points out that the preliminary draft of the law on regulation of professional activities (proposed by the FSLN and published jointly by the Government and the FSLN) confers extremely wide powers on the bodies which would be created (National Council of Professions and National Confederation of National Associations), and thus limits the freedom of action of those engaged in independent professions. According to the IOE, the Government is hostile towards COSEP and its members.
.Finally, the IOE alleges that under Decree No.  of  September , the negotiation and approval of collective agreements require the Ministry of Labour's approval.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that the death of Mr. Salazar is in no way related to the fact that he was the Vice-President of COSEP, and his death could not be considered as murder without the elements of premeditation, treason or profit, and it should also not be qualified as homicide since his death resulted from an armed conflict between the members of the Security Services of the State and an armed group of which he was a member and which was conspiring against the Government.
.The Government adds that the death of Mr. Salazar cannot be considered as a violation of Convention No. , which was plainly demonstrated by the statements of witnesses and of detainees. These persons had confessed to planning a coup d'tat and to conspiracy plans which they tried to carry out in co-ordination with some members of the former Somoza Guard. The Government further argues that Mr. Salazar's activities could in no way be regarded as trade union activities, since they were obviously conspiratorial and constituted a crime against the security of the State.
.The Government states that the detainees could in no way be considered trade union leaders, as the IOE claims, and that these persons did not belong to any trade union (even if this were possible in Nicaragua there are no employers' professional associations, but only organisations formed and regulated by the Civil Code). These persons were conspiring against peace, the security of the State and the life of government officials.
.Consequently the Government rejects the accusations of violation of Convention No.  and of murder.
.The Government sent a copy of the indictment and the text of the judgement (presently under appeal), as well as a copy of the statements to the judicial authorities and to the police linking the following persons to conspiratorial activities aiming at the overthrow of the Government and assassination of government officials: Jorge Salazar, Dora Maria Lau de Lacayo, Leonardo Ramn Sommarriba, Alejandro Salazar Elizondo, Nestor Moncada Lau, Luis Adolfo Valle Lau, Mario Hannon Talavera,",0,1980,Nicaragua
363,"it has no link of continuity. However, the Government points out that a new inquiry is now being undertaken to clarify the matter, the results of which will be communicated to the Committee.
.As regards the imprisonment of the trade union leader Francisco Girn Ramos (Case No. ), the Government states that he was indicted on a charge of destroying genuine documents and that there was never any allegation that there had been an infringement of freedom of association. The Government adds that Grancisco Girn has been free since , when the judge ruled that he should be released on bail, although it was not known why a final judgement had not been pronounced at that time. A recommendation has thus been made for a decision be issued as soon as possible and the Committee will be informed accordingly.
.As regards the allegations concerning workers who were killed, wounded and arrested (Case No. ), the Government stated that the acts of violence to which reference had been made probably took place before  October  and that one of the reasons why the previous regime had been deposed was precisely because of the repeated protests against violations of human rights and freedom of association which the Revolutionary Junta was endeavouring to end by all available means. More recently, the Government has declared that a major programme of agrarian reform is currently under way, the socio-economic consequences of which will ensure that the events involved in the present case cannot recur. As regards the death of Trnsito Vsquez, the Government explained that, under a court decision issued on  March , a stay of proceedings was granted concerning the charge relating to wilful homicide and the release was ordered of Mximo Garcia Lpez, Josh Felipe Garcia Vsquez and Sarbelo Garcia Ramirez. The Government adds that the accused had admitted they were members of the Federation of Catholic Peasants of El Salvador (FECCAS) and the Onion of Field Labourers (UTC) and not the Nationalist Democratic Organisation (ORDEN), as had been stated by the complainants.
.As regards the observations made in connection with Case No. , the Government states that, on  June , after a work stoppage had been declared in the ""El Granjero S.A."" undertaking, forces of the Army intervened in order to eject the picketers who had threatened to damage plant equipment. The Government adds that terrorist elements had infiltrated into these groups.
.As regards Case No. , the Government states that it has requested the collaboration of the Ministry of Labour and the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Republic so that appropriate investigations may be made into the events of  December , the results of which will be transmitted in due course. As regards the list supplied by the complainants of workers and peasants who had died, the Government states that their deaths were not the result of repressive action due to their trade union activities and obligations, but rather of the violence which continues to be generated by the extreme left and the extreme right and which, by drawing the armed forces into a purely defensive response, are plunging the country into a bloodbath which has been criticised and deplored by the true citizens of El Salvador.
.With regard to Case No. , in which one of the complainants alleged that five trade unionists had been arrested, the Government states that the events in question were brought about by an illegal strike which bad been declared by the River Lempa Hydroelectric Company Workers' Trade Onion on  and  August . The Government adds that the instigators of the strike violated the provisions of the Constitution by not following the procedure set forth in the Labour Code when they cut off without any advance notice the electricity service throughout the country, which seriously damaged the national economy (with losses exceeding  million colones) and caused the irreparable loss of human lives in hospitals and other medical centres. According to the Government, when the situation reached the point of posing a threat to the national security, since the service involved was one which was indispensable to the community, and as a result of the public outcry, the armed forces intervened in the plant without bloodshed and proceeded to arrest the principal leaders of the strike who - with the exception of those who were not considered to be responsible and who were subsequently released - are now being held in prison, where they are being treated correctly. The Government states that the prisoners are subject to the jurisdiction of military courts, which are now investigating their case in collaboration with their defence counsel.
.With regard to the assassination of Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer (Case No. ), the Government stated that it had ordered the arrest of the wealthy right-wing businessmen Ricardo Sol Meza and Hans Christ; the latter is currently in Miami and proceedings are at present under way to seek his extradition. The Government adds that the Public Prosecutor has been especially instructed to appoint, on behalf of the State, representatives to take part in the trial being heard by the Fifth Criminal Court and these representatives have already participated in the investigations. The Government points out that Mr Viera was, in addition to being a member of the Salvadorean Communal Onion, a high official of the Government and was looked upon as one of the major proponents of agrarian reform, all of which constituted the motives for his assassination at the wretched hands of the extreme right and extreme left.
.Finally, as regards the allegations concerning the assassination of workers, trade union leaders and school teachers between  October  and  September  (Case No. ) under the presidency of General Carlos Humberto Romero, the Government states that it does not know why the corresponding investigations did not produce any results, if indeed such investigations took place. The Government adds, however, that in order to demonstrate clearly and sincerely that the present rulers of El Salvador are free of any links or compromises with the past, an investigation will be conducted into these deplorable events, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee as soon as possible.
.Before considering the substance of the various matters raised by the complainants, the Committee would like to express its deep concern at the serious nature of the allegations, most of which refer to the death, assassination, arrest or disappearance of trade unionists and trade union leaders, which have continued to occur even after  October , the date on which the former Government was deposed. While noting the troubled situation which is facing the authorities in El Salvador, the Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only in a climate of respect for fundamental human rights, and to the Resolution concerning Trade Onion Rights and their relation to civil liberties adopted by the International Labour Conference in , which states in particular that the concept of trade union rights is totally meaningless in the absence of civil liberties and that the rights conferred on workers' and employers' organisations must be baled on respect for civil liberties.
.The Committee also deplores the fact that in spite of the time which has elapsed, the Government in its observations has still not replied to all the allegations or has done so only incompletely in some of the cases.
.The Committee notes that the Government considers itself free of any responsibility for the events which allegedly occurred before  October . In this connection, the Committee considers, as it already pointed out at its session in February , that there exists a link of continuity between successive governments in the same State and that although a government cannot be held responsible for events which took place under a preceding one, it has a clear responsibility for any consequences which those events might have produced since its accession to power. This principle is particularly applicable as regards the clarification of events which have led to the loss of human lives or the detention of trade unionists who are still being held in prison.
.As regards the allegations concerning the attacks on the lives or persons of trade unionists or trade union leaders, the Committee cannot but deplore the loss of numerous lives and the injuries mentioned in the complaints. The Committee notes the Government's statement that investigations are now under way concerning the events referred to in Cases Nos. ,  and  and, more generally, into the assassinations which allegedly took place between  October  and  December  (Case No. ) concerning which the Government states that an investigation is being ordered, the results of which will be transmitted to the Committee. However, since the Government has not provided information on the death of the trade union leader Tombs Rosales (Case No. ) or the injuries to which reference is made in Cases Nos.  and  and some of the assassinations",-1,1980,El Salvador
364,"imprisonment of the arrested leaders have been countermanded, but that the latter are still under trial and that the offences for which they might be held responsible as a result of their contempt for the decision of the Regional Labour Court are still under examination. In this connection the Committee must stress that the development of labour relations could be impaired as a result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action, particularly when these are penal sanctions. The Committee also requests the Government to send information on the results of the judicial proceedings against the arrested trade union leaders.
.In the light of the foregoing considerations the Committee feels that it would be useful, in the interests of the development of harmonious industrial relations in the country, for the Government to amend its legislation in the light of the principles set forth in the foregoing paragraphs.
.Lastly, the Committee observes that the Government has not referred in its communication to the allegations relating to the arbitrary dissolution of trade unions, or to the physical assaults on workers in front of trade union premises on  April, which are alleged to have resulted in injuries to dozens of persons, or to the prohibition on the holding of assemblies announced by the police on  April, or to the arrest for a few hours of the delegation of agricultural workers who were supporting the metalworkers' strike, or to the many dismissals which are said to have taken place two days after the strike. The Committee therefore requests the Government to send additional information on each of these points.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the principle that, although the lawfulness of a strike may be made subject to previous recourse to conciliation or voluntary arbitration procedures, the imposition, in the present Brazilian judicial system, of compulsory arbitration resulting in a compulsory award can deprive the workers of the possibility of legally exercising their right to strike action.The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the results of the court proceedings pending against the trade union leaders mentioned by the complainants.It also requests the Government to keep it informed of the measures taken to cease the control of the authorities over the unions.The Committee requests the Government to send additional information on the allegations to which it has not replied, as set forth in the previous paragraph.",0,1980,Brazil
365,".The Committee last examined these cases at its February  meeting, in the light of information obtained during a direct contacts mission conducted in El Salvador from  to  January . (See rd Report of the Committee, paras.  to , approved by the Governing Body at its nd Session (February-March ).)
.The Committee had already examined Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in November , November , May  and May  (see th, th, th and th Reports of the Committee); Case No.  at its meetings in May  and May  (see th and th Reports of the Committee); and Case No.  at its meeting in November  (see th Report of the Committee).
.Since these cases were last examined by the Committee, new allegations have been submitted by the following organisations: the World Confederation of Organisations of the Teaching Profession ( May ), the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ( May and  June ), the World Federation of Trade Unions ( May ) and the United Trade Union Federation of El Salvador ( June,  and  July,  September,  October and  December ). The Government submitted certain observations in communications dated  July,  August and  September ,  and  January,  and  February and  April .
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Committee notes with concern that since the last examination of the case, the complainant organisations have submitted extremely serious allegations concerning the death and arrest of trade union officials and trade unionists, the searching of the headquarters of a trade union organisation and various actions of interference and anti-trade union discrimination.
.The Committee notes that the trial concerning the murder of the trade union official Jos Aristides Mndez has been opened and that the presumed authors of the crime have been identified and arrested. The Committee nevertheless notes that in referring to the other two cases, the Government has merely pointed out that the trade unionist Francisco Mndez is not on the lists of forensic tests carried out and that the security forces know nothing about the death or disappearance of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes, although investigations are still under way. The Committee stresses the importance of carrying out a judicial investigation in all cases with a view to elucidating the facts, determining the responsibilities and punishing the guilty parties if it is proven that offences have been committed. Furthermore, the Committee notes that with respect to the alleged murder of Toms Rosales and the injuries allegedly suffered by Rafael Hernndez, judicial investigations carried out proved that crimes of this nature had not been committed. Finally, the Committee notes that it has not been possible to identify the murderers of Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez during the trial conducted to this effect and that the trial concerning the death of Rodolfo Viera and two North American trade unionists (Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman) is still under way.
.As regards the alleged arrests of trade union officials and trade unionists, the Committee notes the release of Victor Manuel Martnez, Francisco Palacios, Febe Elizabeth Velsquez, Etelvina Snchez Vsquez, Adela Margarita Navarrete, David Rolando Oliva and Juan Gilberto Durn. As charges against those concerned were dropped and bearing in mind the general grounds for arrest communicated by the Government in some cases against the persons concerned, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures of detention which restrict the exercise of trade union rights can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities (see, for example, rd Report, Cases Nos.  and  (El Salvador), paras.  and ) and that when this is connected with activities in the defence of the interests of workers, it constitutes a serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular (see, for example, rd Report, Case No.  (El Salvador), para. ).
.Furthermore, the Committee notes that the Government pointed out that Jos Edgar Gmez Guerrero, Cecilio Guzmn Prez, Leonel Arvalo Morales, Jaime Ernesto Martnez Menjvar, Andrs Valiente and Celso Antonio Rivas Henrquez were arrested and put on trial on charges of belonging to terrorist groups. The Government also mentioned the trial of Daniel Rosaide Cullar and Rafael Vsquez Fabin without going into further detail. The Committee requests the Government to give information on this and, in particular, to indicate the specific facts with which all the trade unionists mentioned above are charged so that it might examine the allegations in full knowledge of the facts. The Committee also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding these arrests. Finally, the Committee notes that the name of Santos Ventura is not on the lists of detained persons, that Jos Antonio Garca Hernndez and Julio Hernndez Rojas are being detained on the charge of murdering a trade union official and that the Government has not replied specifically to the allegations concerning the arrest of Gregorio Aguilln Ventura ( February ), Adalberto Martnez ( June ), Andrs Miranda ( June ), Jos Antonio Rodrguez ( August ), and the arrest of the  trade unionists mentioned in paragraph  of the rd Report.
.The Committee also notes that, according to the Government, no public security body knows anything about the arrest of the trade union officials Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos. In view of the allegations that these persons are missing, the Committee repeats its request that a judicial inquiry should be carried out to ascertain their whereabouts.
.As regards the allegation that the registration of the most representative executive committee of the Textile Workers' Trade Union of Industras Unidas SA was refused, the Committee notes the Government's comments, according to which various general assemblies were held one after the other and that, apart from one case, irregularities had occurred. The Committee considers that in the present case it does not have enough information at its disposal to be able to come to a decision on this matter. However, it notes that there is a possibility that there might be grounds to initiate legal proceedings and that this right does not seem to have been exercised.
.Finally, the Committee regrets that the Government has not replied to the allegations concerning the raid of the ANDES premises on  April  by the armed forces, who took away documents such as the list of members; it also failed to mention the dismissal of six union officials in the telecommunications sector because of the strike of  April .
.In the light of its foregoing interim conclusions, the Committee invites the Governing Body to approve the following recommendations:a) The Committee is conscious of the difficult situation that the country is going through; however, it considers it necessary to request from the Government the information referred to below so as to be able to reach conclusions in full knowledge of all the facts raised in the allegations and in the light of the situation prevailing in the country.b) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the alleged murders of the trade unionists Francisco Mndez and Marco Antonio Orantes (Case No. ), and to carry out a judicial inquiry into this matter. The Committee also requests the Government to provide information on developments in the trials concerning the murder of trade union official Jos Aristides Meja (Case No. ) and the murder of Rodolfo Viera and the two North American trade unionists, Michael Hammer and Mark Pearlman (Case No. ). As regards this last point, the Committee regrets that, despite the time which has elapsed since the murders, a final judgement has not been handed down.c) The Committee requests the Government to carry out a judicial inquiry into the disappearance of Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos (Case No. ) and expresses the hope that this will ascertain their whereabouts.d) The Committee requests the Government to provide additional information on the trade unionists who are still detained and/or being tried, indicating, in particular, the specific facts with which they are charged (Cases Nos.  and ). It also requests the complainant organisations to supply additional information on the circumstances surrounding the arrests of those concerned.e) The Committee requests the Government to comment on the allegations to which it has not replied, which are referred to in the previous paragraph.
.At its February  meeting the Committee on Freedom of Association was informed that the Government of El Salvador was ready to accept a",0,1980,El Salvador
366,"direct contacts mission to examine the various aspects of Cases Nos. , , , , , , , ,  and , noted this information with interest and expressed the hope that, upon receipt of confirmation from the Government, arrangements could be made at an early date for such a mission to take place (see th Report of the Committee, para. , approved by the Governing Board at its th Session (February-March )).
.During the visit of the Director-General of the ILO to El Salvador in May , he proposed a direct contacts mission to His Excellency the President of the Republic, in conformity with the decision adopted by the Committee on Freedom of Association at its February  meeting regarding the complaints pending against El Salvador. n this occasion the President stated that, although he had not requested an ILO mission, he did not reject the direct contact; mission proposed, and indicated that the country opened its doors to the ILO mission.
.In its th Report (May ), approved by the Governing Body at its th Session (May-June ), the Committee took the following decision in connection with the cases relating to El Salvador: ""As regards the cases relating to El Salvador (Cases Nos. , , , , , , ,  and ), the Committee notes that following an official visit by the Director-General to the country, the Government is willing to accept a direct contacts mission with a view to examining the various aspects of these cases. The Committee hopes that the necessary arrangements will be able to be made shortly so that this mission can take place as soon as possible.""
.In a communication received on  November  the Salvadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the ILO that the direct contacts mission could visit the country.
.The Director-General of the ILO appointed Mr. Andrs Aguilar, member and former president of the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights and member of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights as his representative to conduct the mission. The mission took place in San Salvador from  to  January . During the mission the Director-General's representative was accompanied by Mr. Alberto Odero, member of the Freedom of Association Branch of the International Labour Standards Department, and Mr. Luis Zamudio, Regional Adviser on Standards.
.The mission was received by the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, His Excellency Miguel Alejandro Gallegos, by Dr. Lzaro Tadeo Bernal Lizama, Vice Minister of Labour and Social Welfare, and Dr. Antonio Lara Gavidia, Head of the International Affairs Department of the Ministry, by the members of the Labour and Social Welfare Committee of the Legislative Assembly, by senior officials of the Ministry of Justice, and by representatives of employers"" and workers' organisations.
.El Salvador has ratified neither the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), nor the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In the first place, the Committee wishes to thank Mr. Andrs Aguilar for having agreed to carry out the direct contacts mission, as well as for his detailed report on the pending cases, which has allowed the Committee to examine them. The Committee considers that the report of the Director-General's representative attests to the usefulness of missions of this kind in clarifying matters arising from allegations by the complainant organisations.
.Since the content of the allegations and the information supplied by the Government, as well as the information obtained by the Director-General's representative during the mission are contained in the mission report (see Annex), the Committee can proceed directly to formulate its conclusions on the various cases.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:General recommendations(a) The Committee takes note of the report of the Director-General's representative on the mission carried out in El Salvador from  to  January . The Committee also notes that the mission enjoyed full freedom of action and movement and that the authorities of the Ministries of Labour and Justice with which it came into contact gave it every facility and co-operated actively in obtaining the information requested by the Committee on Freedom of Association.(b) The Committee notes that, according to the mission report, although there has been a marked drop in the frequency of attempts on lives and physical integrity and in the number of disappearances and arrests of persons connected with the trade union movement since the elections of May , there is continued insecurity.(c) The Committee also notes that the mission ascertained that a wide variety of trade union organisations representing all tendencies exist and operate in the country and that they play an active and militant role in national life and resort to strikes. The organisations having recourse to such action include public-sector workers' organisations, despite the fact that such action is illegal for this category of workers. Nevertheless, according to the mission report, trade union activities are often conducted in an atmosphere of fear which has an unfavourable effect on their exercise, and according to the organisations interviewed, such activities are viewed with hostility in many employers' circles - particularly in the private sector - which oppose the formation of organisations and the exercise of their rights.(d) In general, the Committee concludes from the mission report that there is still a need to make much progress in El Salvador to achieve genuine respect for human rights in general and trade union rights in particular. The Committee notes that according to the authorities of the Ministry of Labour, this is one of the main objectives of Government policy, and concrete measures to this effect have been and are being taken.(e) While the Committee is aware of the serious difficulties El Salvador is facing, it calls on the Government to adopt appropriate measures to guarantee that trade union rights may be exercised in a normal fashion; this will only be possible in conditions in which fundamental human rights are respected and in a climate free of violence, pressures and threats of any kind.Cases Nos. , ,  and (a) The Committee regrets that the proceedings relative to the homicide of Manuel Antonio and Jos Antonio Carrillo Vzquez and of Santiago Hernndez have failed to identify those responsible for the crime, and that they have been dropped.(b) The Committee requests the Government to take steps with a view to the opening of an investigation into the alleged homicide of Toms Rosales, Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, in respect of whom there is no record of proceedings having been opened. The Committee requests the Government to keep it informed of developments concerning the disappearance of the trade union leader Rafael Hernndez Olivo, as well as of the final outcome of the proceedings concerning the wilful homicide of the trade unionists Rodolfo Viera, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, indicating whether the investigation has been able to establish who instigated the crime committed by the two defendants.Case No. (a) The Committee regrets that the trade unionist Marta Imelda Dimas remained in prison for over two months.(b) The Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade unionists for trade union activities or membership is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to undertake an investigation to determine the whereabouts of the trade union leaders Elsy Mrquez and Jos Snchez Gallegos, and to keep it informed thereof.(b) The Committee notes that some of the trade unionists mentioned by the complainants are free, and awaits the information promised by the Government concerning another  trade unionists whose arrest has been alleged and whose names are listed in the conclusions (concerning these  trade unionists, the Government reported that none of the persons listed is at present imprisoned in any of the detention centres in the country, but that further investigations will be carried out to determine whether they had been imprisoned at some stage in police centres).Case No. (a) As regards the murder of trade union leader Juan Pablo Meja Rodriguez, the Committee notes that proceedings have reached the stage of examination of witnesses, and that no one has yet been arrested. The Committee deeply regrets the murder of this trade union leader and requests the Government to keep it informed of developments in the proceedings.(b) While noting that all of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged in connection with this case are now free, the Committee none the less recalls that some of them were detained for trade union activities, and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders or members for reasons connected with their activities in defence of the interests of workers constitutes serious interference with civil liberties in general and with trade union rights in particular.Case No. (a) The Committee points to the principle that all workers' organisations have the right to affiliate with international organisations of workers implies the right of national and international trade union organisations",0,1980,El Salvador
367,"to maintain contact with one another, without interference by the public authorities.(b) While noting that the judicial authority dropped the charges against Modesto Rodriguez and Elsy Esperanza Alvarenga, the Committee deplores their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights, and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee observes that the Government has not sent observations on the alleged murder of the trade union leader Marco Antonio Orantes. Faced with this very serious situation and while deeply regretting the murder of this trade union leader, the Committee requests the Government to send its observations on this matter, indicating in particular whether any proceedings have been instituted and if so, their current status.(b) The Committee concludes that the judicial decision declaring the strike in the Salvadorian Social Security Institute illegal and ordering the removal of those occupying its premises does not constitute a violation of the principles of freedom of association, inasmuch as the Institute is engaged in medical and health-care services. The Committee regrets the death of several members of the public security forces and some insured persons, and notes that, according to the Government and contrary to what the complainants maintain, none of the dead or wounded were members of the trade union organisations involved.(c) The Committee notes that the judicial authority dropped the charges against four of the trade union leaders whose detention had been alleged, but regrets their detention and draws the Government's attention to the fact that the detention of trade union leaders and members against whom no specific charges are retained restricts the exercise of trade union rights and that such measures can give rise to a climate of intimidation and fear prejudicial to the normal exercise of trade union activities.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take conciliatory measures with a view to promoting a climate of reconciliation and understanding between the Servipronto S.A. undertaking and its trade union enabling the resolution of current problems concerning the guarantees for the exercise of trade union rights, and an examination of the possibility of reinstating the trade union leader Israel Snchez Cruz, a measure that would undoubtedly contribute to more harmonious labour relations.(b) The Committee wishes to point out in general that in the event of a strike the authorities should resort to the use of force only when law and order are seriously threatened.
.The complaint presented by the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) on  July  is concerned mainly with the death on  June  of Toms Rosales, a leader of the workers' union Granja Santa Ins, and the wounding of four other trade unionists during clashes with the armed forces which occurred in connection with a peaceful strike called by them in support of a number of wage claims.
.From the outset the Government, although it transmitted no comments on this case, refuted none of these allegations and on  September  furnished information to the effect that Carlos Hernndez, another trade union leader, had been arrested on  June , the day of the strike, for disturbing the peace and threatening to damage the installations of the undertaking and had been released on  June .
.Thereafter, in other communications, the Government never denied the facts alleged by the complainant organisation but did not transmit, as requested by the Committee, its observations concerning the death of Toms Rosales and the wounds inflicted on four other trade unionists on  June  during a peaceful strike at the Granja Santa Ins.
.The Committee observes, however, that in its communication of  January  the Government denies any knowledge of the facts alleged, according to a report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety contained in Note No.  dated  June .
.The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information on this case, which has been requested several times and it recalls that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only where fundamental human rights are respected. It can only deplore the existence of situations in which trade unionists are killed or wounded in the performance of their trade union functions and in particular when engaged in peaceful strikes. It draws the Government's attention to the urgent need to take active measures to prevent in the future any loss of human life in similar situations.
.The complaint of the World Confederation of Labour (WCL) concerned the murder of trade union leaders. In a communication of  April  the WCL reported that Jos Santos Tiznado and Pedro Gonzlez, the leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central, had been murdered by uniformed members of the National Guard in the Jess Suburb of San Ramn, Department of Cuscatln, at midnight on  May . In addition Manuel Antonio Carillo and Jos Antonio Carillo, former leaders of the Salvadorian Peasants' Central and members of the El Rosario Agricultural and Consumers Limited, had been murdered by agents of repressive forces on  June ; this, said the complainant organisation, was proved by the calibre of the bullets found near their bodies. In addition, Rafael Hernndez Olivo, Secretary-General of the Irrigation and Drainage Section of the National Association of Workers in the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry (ANTMAG), had been taken to Metapn Hospital after being injured in an accident, had subsequently been arrested by the rural police and had since disappeared.
.Successive items of information transmitted by the Government showed that investigations were being made into the murder of these four peasants and the disappearance of the Secretary-General of ANTMAG. The Government had never denied the facts but had not supplied specific information on the circumstances surrounding the death of Jos Santos Tiznado, Pedro Gonzlez, Manuel Antonio Carillo or Jos Antonio Carillo or the disappearance of Rafael Hernndez Olivo. In May  the Committee urged the Government to supply such information without delay. In addition it drew attention to the importance it attached to the holding of an independent judicial inquiry when there was loss of human life.
.As in the previous case, the Committee notes that the Government, in its communication of  January last, declares that the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety knows nothing whatsoever about the death of these persons and that Rafael Hernndez is not, to its knowledge, detained by any unit of the forces of public safety according to information received in Note No.  of  February  which contains a report from the Ministry in question.
.The Committee draws attention to the contradiction between the earlier information and this last communication, inasmuch as it was stated previously that investigations into these murders were under way. The Committee again emphasises the need to ensure that justice punishes the guilty parties and for the Government to keep it informed of the results of the investigation and any penalties imposed. In addition it urges the Government to supply precise information on these events and, in particular, on the fate of Rafael Hernndez Olivo.
.In this case, on  January  the ICFTU denounced the assassination on  January , of Rodolfo Viera, Secretary-General of the Salvadorian Communal Union, and of two American trade unionists, Mark Pearlman and Michael Hammer, representatives of the AFL-CIO in El Salvador, while staying at the Hotel Sheraton in San Salvador where they were working on an agrarian reform programme to improve living and working conditions in rural areas.
.In June , the Government stated that a trial was being held in the Fifth Criminal Court of San Salvador and that the accused, Ernesto Sol Meza, had been released by order of the Supreme Court after submitting an appeal, and that the other accused, Hans Krist, had been acquitted. The Committee therefore urged the Government to pursue actively its investigations into the case and to send it the text of any judgment handed down.
.The Government, in its communication of  March , repeated the same information but added that judgment had been delivered in the proceedings against other accused persons who were deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, but that the parties had lodged appeals.
.The Government states in its communication of  January  that the Second Criminal Chamber of the First Section of the Central Court delivered on appeal a ruling dated  April  pursuant to sections  and  of the Code of Criminal Procedure of which the Government supplies an extract. This ruling upholds the dismissal, by order of the Supreme Court dated  December , of the charges against Ernesto Sol Meza and Hans Krist after they had lodged their application therefore; it confirms the judgment delivered against the accused Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez, from which they had appealed, and stays execution with a reservation in favour of Lieutenant Lpez Sibrian;",0,1980,El Salvador
368,"it vacates the order for the detention of Hans Krist and Lpez Sibrian for lack of grounds; it orders that the statement made by the Prosecutor of the Chamber in his reply to the accusations concerning the accused Lpez Sibrian should be reported to the Supreme Court.
.The Committee takes note of this information and notes in particular that a sentence has been handed down against the persons deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, namely Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez. It requests the Government to continue to send it information on the final outcome of this case and to inform it in particular whether the investigation has managed to identify the instigator or instigators of the crime.
.The Trade Unions International of Transport Workers, in its communication of  August , alleged that several trade union activists including Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been wrongfully arrested by the police at the premises of the""Transport Workers' Trade Union on  August . After the Committee had examined the case in November , the question of the detention of Mr. Martinez Alvarado remained pending; the Government stated that he had been arrested by the police on  August  and detained at ""La Esperanza"" Penitentiary Centre in the Canton of San Luis Mariona. The Government later indicated that this trade unionist had been in custody at the Central Penitentiary by order of the military examining magistrate since  August  and had been prosecuted under Decree No. , which contains provisions concerning procedure in case of offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law.
.In a communication of  April  the complainant organisation supplied additional allegations concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the secretary of the trade union, who had also been in prison since  October , and further alleged that the Government had arrested Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez, Disputes Secretary of the same trade union, on  February .
.At its previous examination of the case, in May-June , the Committee noted with grave concern that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado had been in custody without trial since August . The Committee also observed that, according to the Government, this trade unionist was being prosecuted for offences against the peace and independence of the State and against international law but that the Government had communicated no information about the specific acts of which he was accused; according to the complainants, on the other hand, the person in question had been arrested without justification - along with others who had since been released - by the police at the premises of the Transport Workers' Trade Union.
.The Committee also noted that the trade unionists Marta Imelda Dimas and Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez were reported to have been in prison since October  and February  respectively, and the Committee requested the Government to communicate its observations in this regard.
.In its telegram of  June  the Government mentions that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado has been released under a Legislative Decree of amnesty. It repeats this information in its telegram of  June and adds that Jorge Benjamin Rodriguez has also been released under the same law. In its communication of  January last, the Government explains that Alejandro Martinez Alvarado was released under the amnesty law adopted by the Government of El Salvador on  May .
.The Committee, while noting the release of the two above-mentioned trade unionists under the amnesty law of  May , observes that the Government supplies no information concerning Marta Imelda Dimas, the union secretary, who according to the complainant organisation has been in prison since  October .
.Consequently, the Committee urges the Government to supply precise information concerning the detention in which this trade unionist has been held for many months and to state the specific acts with which she is charged. The Committee requests that this person be released or tried as soon as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority, and asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.In this case the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) reported on  October  that the following trade union leaders had been arrested or had disappeared during October : Silvestre Ortz, treasurer of a sugar refinery trade union, arrested on  October; Daniel Avalos, leader of the trade union of a dairy products undertaking, and Pablo Ramrez Cornejo, leader of the Industrial Workers' Trade Union, both arrested on  October; Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, secretary of the Federation of the Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries arrested at his home on  October; Hctor Hernndez, second secretary of SETRAS, imprisoned by the rural police; and Berta Alicia Cosme of the FENASTRAS trade union, who had disappeared on  October. In a supplementary letter dated  May , the WFTU also referred to many other arrests and disappearances of persons, a list of whom is supplied as an annex to this case.
.With its letter of  March  the Government transmitted a photocopy of a note from the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety (Note No.  of  February  signed by Colonel Ren E. Auerbach) in which this officer admitted that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz, Pablo Cornejo Ramirez and Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had been arrested by the police, the first two on  October and the third on  October. These three persons were being detained by order of the competent court, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares being at the Mariona Penal Centre.
.In a communication of  March  the Government stated further that Berta Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, had been arrested in October  with other persons who, like her, were accused of being members or leaders of organisations engaged in terrorist activities, and that they were being held by order of the judge because the proceedings against them were at the preliminary investigation stage.
.The Committee, while expressing its concern at the length of time for which these trade unionists had been kept in detention pending trial, considered in May-June  that the Government ought to take steps to ensure that the persons mentioned in the complainants' communications of  October  and  May  be released or, if charges were being preferred against them, brought before the courts. The Committee further requested the Government to supply detailed information concerning the fate of those persons.
.By a telegram of  June  the Government reported that Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, Pablo Cornejo Ramrez, Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, and Pedro Ramirez Esquivel had been released under the Legislative Decree of amnesty of  May . This information was enlarged upon in the communication of  January , in which the Government states that, according to the report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had indeed been amnestied on  May , Pablo Cornejo Ramirez on  May , Berta Alicia Cosme on  May  and Antonio Campos Mendoza on  August , and that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz had been released under a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice on  May .
.The Committee, while taking note of this information, observes with deep concern that in this case most of the persons mentioned by the complainants remain in custody since October , or are still missing, and that no explanation of their fate has been provided by the Government. The Government stated in its telegram of  June  that, generally speaking, the annexed list was made up of trade unionists detained for criminal offences and awaiting trial for acts carrying penalties of more than four years' imprisonment. The Government states that it respects fully human rights but that persons involved in activities running counter to the rights and freedoms of the people of El Salvador as recognised in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights could not be exonerated under the basic domestic legislation.
.In these circumstances the Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in detail on the situation of all these trade unionists; to communicate to the Committee its observations on the specific acts with which these persons are charged and the text of the judgments concerning them; and to provide details as to the fate of those who are missing.
.The Committee keenly deplores the fact that, in all the cases examined above, a very violent situation has resulted in the death, wounding or arrest of trade unionists in circumstances which, in the absence of specific and detailed information, are difficult for it to assess. The Committee emphasises that such a climate of violence is unpropitious for the development not only of industrial relations but also of a free and independent trade union movement inasmuch as, for such a movement to develop, fundamental human rights must be respected.
.The Committee points out that, when cases of this nature - namely, of detention under emergency regulations - have been referred to it, it has always [see, for",0,1980,El Salvador
369,"the events) one of which is dated before and the other after the judgment, the Committee must express its surprise at this discrepancy and urge the Government to explain this. The Committee considers that this is all the more important in view of the fact that the judgment of  March  was only transmitted with a communication dated  February , i.e. almost two years after being handed down.
.So as to be in a position to reach conclusions on the outstanding allegation in full knowledge of the facts, the Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the judgment of  March  is considered as final and whether there was a possibility to appeal this decision, or whether it was subject to automatic review
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report and, in particular, the following conclusions:(a) The Committee expresses its surprise at the contradiction between the judgment of  March  (according to which the Vice-President of COSEP, Mr. Jorge Salazar fired first against the state security patrol and died in the ensuing exchange of fire) and the Government's two communications dated, respectively, before and after this judgment (in which it is explicitly and implicitly recognised that Mr. Salazar was unarmed at the time of the events) ; this all the more so since the judgment was only transmitted by the Government nearly two years after being handed down. It urges the Government to explain this contradiction and this delay.(b) The Committee requests the Government to indicate whether the judgment of  March  is considered as final and whether there was a possibility to, appeal this decision, or whether it was subject to automatic review.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present interim report and, in particular, the following recommendations:
.General recommendations(a) The Committee appreciates the spirit of co-operation that the Government has demonstrated by accepting that the Director-General's representative, during the direct contacts mission, could examine with the authorities the various aspects of the cases which were still pending and seek further information on them. The Committee observes that, thanks to the information obtained by the Director-General's representative, it has been able to examine a substantial number of the allegations to which the Government had not replied. However, the Committee regrets that the Government has not supplied detailed information on certain outstanding allegations.(b) As regards the statement made by the Deputy Minister concerning the content of the complaints the Committee recalls that even if, in certain instances, the allegations have lacked some precision, it is required to examine them in all objectivity and to seek to obtain a maximum of information concerning them.(c) The Committee wishes to express its serious concern at the large number of leaders and members of workers' and employers' organisations who have been arrested. The Committee considers that freedom of association can only be exercised in conditions in which fundamental human rights and in particular, the right to freedom from arbitrary arrest, are fully respected and guaranteed.(d) The Committee observes from its examination of certain allegations and of the information supplied by the Government and from the mission report that acts of hostility between union organisations or within individual organisations occur rather frequently. The Committee considers that freedom of association implies the right of workers' and employers' organisations to resolve any difficulties by themselves, and without interference by the authorities; the Committee also considers that it is for the Government to create an atmosphere conducive to the resolution of such difficulties.
.Recommendations as to individual casesCase No. (a) The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not yet supplied the text of the judgment handed down by the military court on the military personnel responsible for the death of employer leader Salazar Argello which was handed down some time ago; it urges the Government to transmit this judgment at an early date.(b) The Committee notes with interest that the public prosecutor aid not bring any penal charges against certain employer leaders for offences against the security of the State and other offences. The Committee would recall that the preventive detention of leaders of workers' or employers' organisations for activities connected with the exercise of their rights is contrary to the principles of freedom of association.(c) As regards the composition of the Council of State, the Committee considers that participation of workers' and employers' organisations in the Council should imply the strict application of criteria on the basis of which the representativity of these organisations may be determined; moreover, the participation of these organisations in the Council should not deprive other organisations of their right to defend the interests of their members.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to take up the suggestion of the Director-General's representative that the Ministry responsible for agrarian reform should obtain further information and be informed of the allegations that members of the CTN have been physically attacked by the authorities on state-controlled banana estates and sugar plantations and that sugar workers affiliated to the CTN have been prevented from entering their work centres; the Committee also requests the complainant to transmit any further information it may have concerning this matter.(b) The Committee requests the Government to call for an investigation of the alleged threats by official militias against the lives of trade union leaders (specifically, Luis Mora and Salvador Snchez) and to keep it informed of its findings.Case No. (a) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegation that the Ministry of Labour has been recommending trade union organisations to join the Sandinista Central of Workers (CST) and that copies of the by-laws of trade union organisations, on paper bearing the Ministry of Labour letterhead, have been deposited at the headquarters of the CST so that it can register the recently constituted organisations among its members.(b) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegation that SEEOMC leader Alejandro Arnuero, who was to take part in a congress of the International Transport Workers' Federation in Brazil, had his passport withdrawn without any valid reason. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(c) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the final decision handed down in the matter of the alleged embezzlement of SEEOMC funds.(d) The Committee requests the Government to send the text of the judgment handed down on the granting of legal personality to the trade union of workers in various undertakings in the sugar sector (""Faustino Martinez"" and others) so that it can reach conclusions on the allegations with all relevant information at its disposal.(e) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the allegations concerning the searching of the headquarters of FETRACHI and the use of aggression against its leaders.(f) The Committee regrets that the Government has not indicated the precise grounds for the arrest of a number of trade unionists who have now been released but merely gives the name o the Act that they are said to have contravened; it again requests the Government to transmit information on this matter.(g) The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the information passed on by the CTN to the Director-General's representative concerning seven trade unionists who, contrary to the claims of the Government, are allegedly still in custody.The Committee also requests the Government to send its observations on the other allegations concerning arrests to which it has not replied, involving  union leaders or members.(h) In general terms, the Committee draws the Government's attention to the fact that measures designed to deprive persons of their freedom entail a serious risk of interference in trade union activities and that, when such measures are taken on trade union grounds, they constitute an infringement of the principles of freedom of association.(i) The Committee observes that the Government has not replied to the allegations that rural workers of WASACA affiliated to the CTN have been interrogated and threatened with imprisonment and that Eugenio Membreo and other members of the CTN executive committee have been threatened and intimidated in their homes. The Committee requests the Government to send its observations on the matter.(j) The Committee considers that no further examination need be made of the allegations relating to the coercion of Denis Maltes; the persecution and harassment of Zacaras Hernndez and Isabel Somarriba; the interference in the SEEOMC meeting on  December ; the detention of  trade union leaders and members of SEEOMC; and the physical attacks and threats against leaders of the CUS due to the SEEOMC meeting called for  May .Case No. (a) The Committee notes with interest that the General Labour Inspectorate has ordered the reinstatement of eight trade unionists employed by ENABUS who, according to the complainants, were dismissed for being members of an organisation affiliated to the CTN.(b) The Committee requests the complainants to send further details regarding the alleged destruction of the premises of the rural workers' union in Rio Grande and Las",0,1980,Nicaragua
370,".The complaints are contained in communications of the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees and the World Federation of Trade Unions dated  and  September , respectively. The Government replied in a communication dated  February .
.Brazil has not ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), but has ratified the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that on  August , Mr. Jos Antonio Nania, Vice-President of the San Pablo Hospital Employees' Association, was notified that his contract of employment was terminated ""without due grounds"".
.According to the complainants, despite the mention of ""without due grounds"" in the notice of termination, this measure was really taken because of Mr. Nania's participation, as representative of his association, in a meeting held by the Trade Unions International of Public and Allied Employees last July in Lima.
.In its communication of  February  the Government states that section  of the Consolidation of Labour Laws provides that track unions may not be formed by government employees or employees of quasi-governmental institutions, thus expressly excluding public employees from the right to organise. The Government also states that Mr. Nania's status as a public employee debarred him from the exercise of trade union activities as a leader, such as participation in the trade union meeting held in Lima, which he attended without the prior authorisation of the competent authority.
.The Government further states that the dismissal of Mr. Nania was due above all to repeated neglect of his duties, which he justified by the assistance he was lending to the San Pablo Hospital Employees' Association. It adds that Mr. Nania's post did not entitle him to trade union immunity or to the temporary job security which is granted to trade union leaders under the Consolidation of Labour Laws.
.While noting that the dismissal of Mr. Nania was due to repeated neglect of his duties, the Committee observes that the notice of dismissal expressly states that the dismissal was made ""without due grounds"" and that the notice is dated  August . The Committee further observes that the legislation excludes public employees from the right to organise and hence to carry on trade union activities and grants special protection against dismissal only to trade union leaders who are not public employees.
.The Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that exclusion of any category of workers - with the exception of the armed forces and the police - from the right to organise is contrary to the principles of freedom of association and that, in accordance with the provisions of Convention No. , which has been ratified by Brazil, the safeguards provided for by the Convention, in particular protection against acts of anti-union discrimination such as dismissal, must be extended also to persons employed by the State or in the public sector who do not act as agents of the public authority. The Committee draws attention to the fact that the same position has for many years been taken by the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations.
.In view of the different treatment established by the legislation in trade union matters for persons who are public employees and for those who are not, the Committee does not rule out the possibility that the trade union function and activities of Mr. Nania may have had a decisive influence in his dismissal. The Committee also considers that a harmonious development of labour relations and freedom of action by occupational organisations would be advanced if Mr. Nania were to be reinstated in his former job and requests the Government to consider the possibility of taking steps to this end.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve the present report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee requests the Government to consider the possibility of taking steps for the reinstatement of Mr. Nania in his employment.The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the fact that the right to organise should apply to all public servants and that protection against acts of anti-union discrimination should also be extended to persons employed by the State or in the public sector who do not act as agents of the public authority.",0,1980,Brazil

.The Committee takes note of this information and notes in particular that a sentence has been handed down against the persons deemed to have been material perpetrators of the crime, namely Jos Dimas Valle Acevedo and Santiago Gmez Gonzlez. It requests the Government to continue to send it information on the final outcome of this case and to inform it in particular whether the investigation has managed to identify the instigator or instigators of the crime.

The Committee requests that this person be released or tried as soon as possible by an impartial and independent judicial authority, and asks the Government to keep it informed of developments in the situation.
.In this case the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) reported on  October  that the following trade union leaders had been arrested or had disappeared during October : Silvestre Ortz, treasurer of a sugar refinery trade union, arrested on  October; Daniel Avalos, leader of the trade union of a dairy products undertaking, and Pablo Ramrez Cornejo, leader of the Industrial Workers' Trade Union, both arrested on  October; Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, secretary of the Federation of the Unions of Workers in the Food, Clothing, Textile and Allied Industries arrested at his home on  October; Hctor Hernndez, second secretary of SETRAS, imprisoned by the rural police; and Berta Alicia Cosme of the FENASTRAS trade union, who had disappeared on  October. In a supplementary letter dated  May , the WFTU also referred to many other arrests and disappearances of persons, a list of whom is supplied as an annex to this case.
.With its letter of  March  the Government transmitted a photocopy of a note from the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety (Note No.  of  February  signed by Colonel Ren E. Auerbach) in which this officer admitted that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz, Pablo Cornejo Ramirez and Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had been arrested by the police, the first two on  October and the third on  October. These three persons were being detained by order of the competent court, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares being at the Mariona Penal Centre.
.In a communication of  March  the Government stated further that Berta Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, had been arrested in October  with other persons who, like her, were accused of being members or leaders of organisations engaged in terrorist activities, and that they were being held by order of the judge because the proceedings against them were at the preliminary investigation stage.
.The Committee, while expressing its concern at the length of time for which these trade unionists had been kept in detention pending trial, considered in May-June  that the Government ought to take steps to ensure that the persons mentioned in the complainants' communications of  October  and  May  be released or, if charges were being preferred against them, brought before the courts. The Committee further requested the Government to supply detailed information concerning the fate of those persons.
.By a telegram of  June  the Government reported that Ral Antonio Castro Palomares, Pablo Cornejo Ramrez, Alicia Cosme, known as Berta, and Pedro Ramirez Esquivel had been released under the Legislative Decree of amnesty of  May . This information was enlarged upon in the communication of  January , in which the Government states that, according to the report of the Ministry of Defence and Public Safety, Ral Antonio Castro Palomares had indeed been amnestied on  May , Pablo Cornejo Ramirez on  May , Berta Alicia Cosme on  May  and Antonio Campos Mendoza on  August , and that Daniel de Jess Avalos de Paz had been released under a ruling of the Supreme Court of Justice on  May .
.The Committee, while taking note of this information, observes with deep concern that in this case most of the persons mentioned by the complainants remain in custody since October , or are still missing, and that no explanation of their fate has been provided by the Government. The Government stated in its telegram of  June  that, generally speaking, the annexed list was made up of trade unionists detained for criminal offences and awaiting trial for acts carrying penalties of more than four years' imprisonment. The Government states that it respects fully human rights but that persons involved in activities running counter to the rights and freedoms of the people of El Salvador as recognised in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights could not be exonerated under the basic domestic legislation.
.In these circumstances the Committee urges the Government to keep it informed in detail on the situation of all these trade unionists; to communicate to the Committee its observations on the specific acts with which these persons are charged and the text of the judgments concerning them; and to provide details as to the fate of those who are missing.
.The Committee keenly deplores the fact that, in all the cases examined above, a very violent situation has resulted in the death, wounding or arrest of trade unionists in circumstances which, in the absence of specific and detailed information, are difficult for it to assess. The Committee emphasises that such a climate of violence is unpropitious for the development not only of industrial relations but also of a free and independent trade union movement inasmuch as, for such a movement to develop, fundamental human rights must be respected.
.The Committee points out that, when cases of this nature - namely, of detention under emergency regulations - have been referred to it, it has always [see, for",0,1980,El Salvador
372,"to the Government.
.In its telegram of  September, the ICFTU referred to the arrest and maltreatment of the members of a humanitarian mission which it had sent to Bolivia. During this mission the authorities are said to have confiscated $, which had been destined for assistance to the families of the imprisoned trade unionists.
.The representative of the Director-General had talks in La Paz with Colonel Luis Arce Gmez, Minister of the interior and acting Minister for Foreign Affairs; General Augusto Caldern Miranda, Minister of Labour; Mgr. Jorge Manrique, Archbishop of La Paz; Dr. Armin E. Kobel, head of the international Committee of the Red Cross delegation to Bolivia; and Mr. Ramn Mantilla, representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. He also met the President (Mr. M. Prez Monasteros) and the executive secretary (Mr. Fernando Moscoso) of the Association of Private Employers of Bolivia. He referred to the allegations received at the ILO, and drew attention to the generally accepted principles governing freedom of association, and inquired as to the Government's intentions. He also asked to meet the trade union leaders Juan Lechin and Simn Reyes.
.The Minister of the Interior stated that the suspension of trade union rights and civil liberties had become necessary as a temporary measure. The Bolivian trade union movement, whose major concern should be the protection of the economic and social interests of the Bolivian workers, had, he said, departed from its proper course and had become a purely political movement, manipulated by its leaders to serve their own political interests. Trade union rights and civil liberties were soon to be restored, however, and the Government was engaged in a reorganisation of the trade union movement designed to ensure that it would serve trade union instead of political purposes. A number of extremist trade union leaders would be expelled from the country, but other trade unionists held in detention would soon be released. It was the Government's wish that no trade unionist should remain in detention, and it agreed that the representative of the Director-General should meet Mr. Juan Lechin and Mr. Simon Reyes.
.The Minister of Labour supplied copies of Presidential Decrees Nos.  of  July and  of  August . The first of those provides for the dissolution of existing trade unions and the restructuring of the Bolivian trade union movement; the second provides for the appointment of workers' representatives (""relacionadores laborales"") to carry out certain trade union functions pending the establishment of a new trade union organisation. He also provided detailed statistics of work stoppages in different sectors of the Bolivian economy during the period June  to June ; these, according to the Minister, were politically motivated, had a disastrous effect on the country's economy and hence justified the action the Government had found it necessary to take. However, he gave assurances that the reorganisation of the Bolivian trade unions would take place with due regard to the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Bolivia, and that the Government would seek the advice and cooperation of the ILO when revising trade union legislation. In respect of two of the allegations the Minister explained, firstly, that while it was true that the headquarters building of the COB was being demolished, this demolition was not directed against the trade unions as such but formed part of a major cleaning-up operation affecting several buildings in the most important avenue in La Paz. New premises would be provided for the reorganised trade unions. Secondly, the allegation that trade union funds and assets had been confiscated was false. These funds and assets had merely been ""frozen"" to make sure that they were preserved, and would be handed over to the new unions once they had been set up.
.The representative of the Director-General met Mr. Juan Lechin in his room at the military hospital in La Paz where he was recovering from an operation. He was accompanied by Dr. Daniel Salamanca, Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of the interior, his request that the interview should take place in the absence of any witnesses having been turned down. However, Mr. Lechin did not appear to be in any way intimidated by the presence of a representative of the authorities. He indicated that he warmly appreciated the intervention of the ILO. He stated that his conditions of detention were reasonably good. He has access to, newspapers and a television set was installed in his room. His brother visited him almost daily. At no stage during his detention had he been subjected to any kind of torture.
.Mr. Simn Reyes was in detention at the Department of Political Order (DOP). The interview with him took place in the prison governor's office, again in the presence of Dr. Salamanca. Mr. Reyes also stated that his conditions of detention were reasonably good and that he had at no time been tortured or subjected to other ill-treatment. Clearly, however, Reyes was a very depressed man, much less talkative and much more subdued than Lechn, although it is difficult to judge whether this was due to differences of personality or to differences in their conditions of detention.
.The representative of the Director-General also met the President and the Executive Secretary of the Association of Private Employers of Bolivia. The President (Mr. M.P. Monasterios) considered that the dissolution of the existing trade unions had become inevitable. Frequent and irresponsible work stoppages, where trade union leaders manipulated the unions to serve their own political purposes, had had disastrous effects on the economy and on the political stability of the country. The situation was, however, now calm and under control, and it was to be hoped that harmonious industrial relations, untinged by political considerations, would be established with the new trade unions that were to be created.
.Discussions with the representatives of the international Committee of the Red Cross, the UNHCR and the Archbishop of La Paz made it possible to establish the whereabouts and the current situation with regard to a number of persons specifically mentioned in the complaints (see appendix). In all too many cases, however, the representative of the Director-General states that identification proved impossible since the names provided were incomplete. The delegation of the international Committee of the Red Cross travels freely throughout the country. The head of the Red Cross delegation, Dr. Kobel, undertook to inform any detained trade unionist he might encounter (and he had already seen quite a number) of the ILO's mission to Bolivia and the efforts being undertaken on their behalf.
.Finally, it should be mentioned that the representatives of the UNHCR and the Intergovernmental Committee for European Migration (ICEN) with whom the representative of the Director General spoke in La Paz declared their readiness to assist with the material arrangements for the departure from Bolivia of those trade unionists and the members of their families who had to leave the country.
.In its communication of  October , transmitted on  November, the Government states that the complaints are totally unfounded. It adds that they have at no time been proved and evidence a deliberate desire to damage the prestige of the Bolivian Government for political reasons.
.The Government indicates that at the present time the majority of the trade unionists who were in detention have been released or exiled at their own request. In other cases, after the subversive activities of the persons concerned had been proved, and after these persons had indicated that it was their wish to remain in Bolivia, it was decided to restrict them to specified towns in accordance with article , paragraph  of the Political Constitution which provides that, if the preservation of public order necessitates the removal of suspects elsewhere, they may by order be restricted to a departmental or provincial capital; however, persons restricted, prosecuted or arrested on such grounds may not be refused a passport if they request it in order to leave the country, and the authorities must grant them the guarantees necessary for this purpose.
.As regards the allegations that limitations have been placed on trade union freedom, the Government states that it has not placed any impediment in the way of the free exercise of trade union rights. It adds that it has merely by order ended the term of office of all trade union leaders because the offices in question had been transformed into profit-making institutions and instruments for permanent disturbances. The Bolivian trade union movement was subject to the orders of a few leaders who received guidelines and instructions from abroad. In the Government's view, the workers themselves were aware that the trade unions could not be turned into centres of political agitation and means of illegal enrichment. The Government adds that it will respect the social gains and rights which are recognised by the law and will authorise the free exercise of trade union activities.
.In order to keep the means of dialogue with the workers open, the Government has authorised the formation of groups of ""labour relations agents"" democratically elected by workers' Committees",0,1980,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
373,".The Committee examined Cases NOS. , , ,  and  at its November  Session.
.In view of the extremely serious nature of the allegations made in this case and the persistent failure of the Government to reply, despite the Committee's numerous requests and urgent appeals, the urgent appeal from the Director-General on  August  to the President of the Republic of Guatemala and the appeal made by the Chairman of the Committee when he met the Government representatives during the last session of the International Labour Conference, the Committee, in accordance with the procedure in force, submitted an interim report on the substance of the case although it had not received any observations from the Government.
.In stating its conclusions and recommendations, the Committee regretted the Government's failure to reply and expressed its deep concern at the seriousness of the allegations, including murders and violent physical attacks on a large number of trade union leaders, trade unionists and workers, arrests and disappearances of persons belonging to the trade union movement, threats, violations of the right to strike, violent interference in trade union meetings, the occupation of trade union premises, attacks on trade union property and dismissals for trade union activities.
.Consequently, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body decide to give to its report the widest possible distribution.
.That recommendation was given effect by sending the Committee's report to all the Governments of States Members of the International Labour Organisation.
.The Committee regrets that, since it submitted its report to the November  Session, the Government has chosen to ignore the Committee's recommendations that it send observations. Accordingly, the Committee can only reiterate the conclusions and recommendations - approved by the Governing Body - that it reached at its November  Sessions and again recommends that the Governing Body decide to give to this report the widest possible distribution.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not sent its observations, despite requests and urgent appeals by the Committee, the urgent appeal of the Director-General and the appeal made by the Chairman of the Committee during the last International Labour Conference. The Committee also regrets that the Government has chosen to ignore the recommendations it made at its November  Session - approved by the Governing Body at the same session - that observations should be sent.The Committee considers it useful again to remind the Government that the purpose of the procedure for the examination of complaints submitted to the Committee is to promote respect for trade union rights, both de jure and de facto, and that whereas the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the governments in turn must recognise the importance of sending detailed replies to the allegations so that an objective appraisal can be made. In this connection the Committee considers that the co-operation of governments in elucidating the questions referred to the Committee by the complainants is essential for promoting full respect for trade union rights and the normal development of the trade union movement.The Committee is extremely concerned at the seriousness of the allegations: murders, violent physical attacks on a large number of trade union leaders, trade unionists and workers, arrests and disappearances of persons linked to the trade union movement, threats, violations of the right to strike, violent interference in trade union meetings, the occupation of trade union premises and dismissals for trade union activities.The Committee considers it necessary again to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can only develop under a regime which respects and guarantees fundamental human rights. The Committee therefore requests the Government to adopt a policy providing for special measures to fully guarantee the right to personal security, adequate protection against unjustified arrest and detention, the right of assembly and demonstration for trade union purposes, and the protection of trade union premises and property.The Committee deeply deplores the numerous losses of human life and the injuries and ill-treatment suffered by those mentioned in the complaints. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the importance of a prompt and independent investigation of the alleged cases of death, assault and ill-treatment, with a view to elucidating the facts in full, identifying the persons responsible and instituting proceedings against them. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of these investigations.The Committee suggests that the Government be asked to inquire into the whereabouts and condition of the persons who have disappeared and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.The Committee recalls that governments should ensure that any person arrested is treated in accordance with the normal procedures and that his case is dealt with promptly, and points out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no subsequent grounds for conviction are found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights and may constitute serious interference in trade union activities.The Committee proposes that the Government be asked to take measures to secure the release of all those arrested owing to their membership of a trade union or involvement in trade union activities generally considered legitimate, and requests it to state the reasons for and circumstances of each arrest mentioned by the complainants, and also to report on the present condition of the persons arrested.The Committee requests the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to continue to pay special attention to the changes required in Guatemalan legislation concerning freedom of association.The Committee wishes that the attention of the Government be drawn to the fact that, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , workers' and employers' organisations should enjoy adequate protection against any interference in each other's activities.The Committee also recalls that Article  of Convention No.  provides that workers must enjoy adequate protection against any acts calculated to cause their dismissal by reason of their union membership or their participation in trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the court decision ordering the reinstatement of the  EGSA workers dismissed in April  is enforced, and to report to the Committee on the matter.
.Lastly, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body again decide to give to this report the widest possible distribution.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.During  and  complaints regarding violations of freedom of association in Guatemala (Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) have been submitted by the following organisations: The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), The World Confederation of Labour (WCL), The Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), The International Union of Food and Allied Industries Workers (IUA) and the International Federation of Commercial, Clerical, Professional and Technical Employees (FIET).
.These complaints involve allegations of murder, detention and torture of trade union leaders and trade unionists, their disappearance, threats made against them, and attacks on trade union premises and property by the armed forces. The complaints were transmitted to the Government of Guatemala as they were received.
.Owing to the lack of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned consideration of Case No.  at its meeting in May , of Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and of Case No.  at its meeting in February .
.The Committee noted at its May  meeting that the observations regarding Case No. , which the Committee requested from the Government at its meeting in May , had not yet been received. It therefore decided to make use of the procedure in force and presented an interim report on the substance of the case.
.In a communication dated  August  the Director General sent an urgent appeal to the President of the Republic of Guatemala. In this communication he voiced the growing concern on the part of the International Labour Organisation over the trade union situation in Guatemala, observing that the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body were currently examining several complaints of alleged violations of the freedom of association submitted by a number of international workers' organisations. The Director-General continued that in this connection the Chairman of the Committee on Freedom of Association had met the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare and the Permanent Representative Ambassador of Guatemala during the th International Labour Conference in Geneva in June , and had informed them that the Government needed to reply in detail to the Committee's requests for information.
.The Director-General also stated in his appeal that during this same period (June ) he had received telegrams from several international trade union bodies which referred to alleged violations of the freedom of association in Guatemala. In view of the seriousness and urgency of the events referred to in the telegrams, he requested the Minister for External Relations to supply him with the Government's observations as soon as possible.
.The Director-General's appeal concluded by kindly requesting the President of the",0,1980,Guatemala

.The complainants add that on  July , So armed men entered the EGSA factory where the workers were on strike and occupying the factory, and abducted two workers, both members of the EGSA workers' union. One of them, Marcelino Santos Chacn, was later released after being assaulted and interrogated by the police.
.On  August , the complainants claim,  trade union leaders were arrested by the national police at the Emauz estate (Escuintla) when they were holding a meeting. They were later transferred to the national police headquarters in Guatemala City. The arrested include: Gustavo Adolfo Bejarano, Guillermo Alberto Moreno Valencia, Juan Guerra, Rafael Girn Mrida, Guillermo Turcios, Edgar de la Cruz, Augusto Yach Ciriaco, Iliana de la Cruz, Roldn Alberto Salazar Uriza, Alfonso Molina Mrida, and the director of the Emauz estate, Jos Luis Pea.
.Finally, in a communication dated  May , the WCL submitted a list of other trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested. The trade union officials on this list include: Marco Antonio Yuntuche Lpez, arrested  November ; Pedro Ignacio Tobar Guzmn -  February ; Antonio Benvenuto Serrano -  May  (the latter two are being held in Guatemala City); Jos Morales Lpez -  September ; Victor Rivas Paiz and Adn Velsquez Duarte -  August . The trade unionists on the same list include: Marco Antonio Blanco - arrested  October ; Juan Lopreto Balux and Plcido Reyes -  December ; Jorge Enrique Garca Castellanos -  January  (in detention in Guatemala City); Manuel Enrique Meja -  August ; Juan de Dios Aguilar, Saturnino Cifuentes Salazar and Luis Gonzlez Bahur -  September ; Jorge Callejas Cruz -  December  (being held in Guatemala City); Agustin Chitay Chapton, Alvaro Oswaldo Estrada, Toms Roberto Poll and Pedro Ramos Micatu -  June  (also being held in Guatemala City); Victor Herrera, Adalberto Jurez, Rosario Leal, Nery Robledo Espinoza and Jos Ruiz, arrested on  August  (currently being held in Paln, Escuintla).
.Further allegations
.The complainants allege that Israel Neftal Mrquez, General Secretary of the EGSA workers' union, was forced to leave the country in March  after numerous attempts were made to kill him. Miguel Cifuentes, General Secretary of the Tacasa tobacco workers' union was forced to leave for the same reason in April .
.The complainants further allege that by the end of September  the largest central trade union body in the country, the CNT, had lost  of its  affiliated trade unions as a result of the methods used by the Government and the employers to destroy the trade unions: the adjournment of legal recognition of the unions for months or even years; occupation by the armed forces of factories, the employers being able to hire soldiers; the creation of (""amarillos"") trade unions dominated by factory owners; the artificial closure of factories later opened again under different names, with new staff and without a trade union, and finally, the use of intimidation.
.On  January , at midnight, according to the complainants, the police were summoned by the management to the EGSA factory, where they threatened to arrest the entire night shift consisting of  to  workers owing to the smashing of an old piece of equipment, which the management were hasty to term ""worker sabotage"".
.The complainants further allege that in the month of April  the management of EGSA dismissed  workers, including three trade union leaders, after the workers' union had appealed to the courts for a ruling ordering the continuation of negotiations for the renewal of a collective agreement which they had already obtained. Despite a ruling by the labour court for the reinstatement of all the dismissed workers, only the three trade union officials have been reinstated. Four of the  workers dismissed have agreed, under death threats, to accept their dismissal.
.With reference to the events of  April , when  armed men entered the CNT premises and arrested  trade unionists, the complainants state that the premises were destroyed and that their typewriters, copying machines and other office equipment were confiscated, and that the telephone line was cut.
.Finally, in a communication dated  March , the ICFTU alleges that a Draft Labour Code submitted to the Congress of the Republic of Guatemala by the Ministry of Labour and Social welfare and due, in principle, to come into force on  May , contained several provisions which are not in conformity with Convention No.  (Case No. ).",-1,1980,Guatemala

The WCL adds that Luis Fernando Moratoya Alvrez, General Secretary of the TIPIC steelworkers' union and of the Central workers' Federation of Guatemala, which is a member of the WCL, was killed by members of the extremist right-wing Secret Anticommunist Army, who fired at him from a car with a machine gun.
.In communications dated  February and  October  CPUSTAL refers to the alleged murder of Jos L. Jacome Pinto, an official of the University staff union and of FASGUA, and the kidnapping and disappearance of Damin Gmez, General Secretary of FASGUA, on  July . According to CPUSTAL, Mr. Gmez had been tortured.
.The complainants refer also to intensified military repression in April  in the rural provinces of Quiche and Escuintla, using helicopters to bomb the region in order to keep the peasants indoors. Soldiers then came to their homes with a list of supposed members of a guerrilla movement who were arrested or disappeared. In a communication dated  October  UITA states that more than  people disappear daily in Guatemala. Many of them are trade union leaders or persons involved in the labour movement. The complainants refer in particular to the disappearance on  June  of Manuel Jess Garcia, a member of the EGSA workers' union.
.Cases of physical assault
.The complainants allege the following cases of physical assault:- on  February  Pablo Bautista was seriously wounded by machine-gun fire from armed civilians. As an official of the CNT he had been particularly active in the region where he had just declared a strike of  cotton plantation and  sugar plantation workers in which the CNT was participating;- on  May  Felix Hernandez Campos, a member of the EGSA Employees' Union, was wounded in the attack in which Efrain Zamora Aroche, President of the Union, was killed;- on  June  several policemen in a car fired with machine guns at the EGSA factory, wounding workers Alfredo Cordn and Alberto Dominguez, both members of the EGSA Employees' Union;- on  July , when workers at the EGSA factory were on strike and occupying the factory,  armed members of the ""Model Platoon"", the Judicial Police and of Command No.  of the National Police stormed into the factory, assaulted the workers and forced them to return to their places of work;- on  July , as has already been indicated, armed men burst into the premises of the Guatemala city municipal workers' union and wounded four workers who were biding the body of the General Secretary of the union, who had just been shot dead.- Finally, the  persons arrested on  April  in the offices of the CNT, when preparing placards for  May (this was referred to in Case No. ), were released on  May showing obvious signs of having been beaten and tortured.
.Arrests
.The complainants allege that shortly after the murder of the EGSA trade union leader Pedro Quevedo on  December ,  workers were placed in gaol on false charges. They add that on  April  Yolanda Urizar Martinez de Aguilar and Rosa Maria Wantlan Garcia, lawyers working for the trade union movement and advisers to the CNT, were arrested at Guatemala City airport together with a secretary working for the CNT. On  December  Alfredo Briones, Willy Mijangos and Carlos Gmez, militant members of the CNT, were also arrested.
.The complainants also allege that on  March  Mario Rolando Cancinos, Fernando Castillo, Noel Escobar, Ageo Morales and Henry Cristbal, all members of the Agua Capa Hydroelectric Works Union at Santa Rosa, were arrested at a meeting where they were discussing their collective demands. Regarding the arrest of Guillermo Hernandez Gomez, Secretary of the sanitation workers' union (INCESA), which was referred to in the allegations concerning Case No. , the complainants report that this in fact took place on  March  when the police intervened in a demonstration of workers at the CAMSA furniture factory.
.The complainants further allege that on  June , after the murders of Edgar Ren Aldama and Oscar Amilcar Tatuaca, the CNT Executive Committee met delegates of the trade unions concerned at the headquarters of the CNT to discuss what action should be taken and to discuss a possible demonstration to protest against the murders. During the discussion a group of  heavily armed men, claiming to be members of the state security forces, blocked traffic in the street of Guatemala City next to the CNT headquarters, broke down the door with a jeep, broke up the meeting and arrested  trade unionists, who were led in small groups to unknown destinations. The national police claim that they have no knowledge of the whereabouts of these arrested people, whose names are as follows: Ismael Vzquez Ortiz, Orlando Prez and Florentino Gmez Lpez (members of the EGSA workers' union), Mario Martinez and Luis Rodolfo Bonilla (members of the Foremost dairy workers' union), Bernardo Marroquin Salazar, Antonio Rodriguez Ramos and Rafael Antonio Aguilar Prez (members of the Kerns Food Products union), Florencia Xocop Chvez, Gonzalo Vzquez, Manuel Snchez and Oscar Salazar (members of the CNT organising Committee), Sonia Furio (member of the BIC union), Irma Prez Osorio and Hilda Carlota Prez Menndez (General Secretary and member respectively of the INDUPLASTIC union), Sara Cabrera Flores (General Secretary of the AGRICASA union).

.At its meeting in November , the Committee observed that in spite of the time which had elapsed, the observations of the Government on Case No.  had not been received and requested it to send them urgently.
.At its meeting in February , the Committee noted with regret that it had still not received the Government's observations regarding Cases Nos. , , ,  and  in view of the extremely serious nature of the allegations the Committee again requested the Government to reply urgently.
.At its May  meeting the Committee noted that, despite repeated requests, the Government had sent no reply.

.In accordance with the Committee's decision, the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare and the Permanent Representative Ambassador of Guatemala in Geneva on  June . The Chairman referred to the persistent failure of the Government of Guatemala to reply to all the communications concerning the cases before the Committee which had been sent to it during the previous year, in particular the letter sent personally by the Director-General of the ILO to the President of the Republic of Guatemala on  August .
.The Chairman of the Committee added that the failure to reply was particularly serious in view of the fact, that four of the five cases involved the death or arrest of trade union leaders.
.The Minister expressed his surprise that the President of the Republic had not replied to the Director-General's letter, and stated that he would do all he could be obtain a reply.
.The Minister also stated that he would do everything possible to reply in writing before returning to Guatemala. To make this task easier a copy of the Director-General's letter was delivered to him on  June, together with copies of all the relevant communications which had been sent concerning Cases nos. , , ,  and .
.Apart from a brief communication dated  June  concerning one aspect of Case No. , which was examined by the Committee at its meeting in May  when it presented an interim report on this case, the Government has not sent any observations on the cases in question.

.CPUSTAL had alleged that Rodolfo Ramirez, General Secretary of the Autonomous Trade Union. Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) and his wife were murdered on  April , together with Maximo Velsquez Melgar, Secretary of the Trade Union of the Hemp Sack Factory, who was treacherously murdered as he was leaving work on  March . CPUSTAL added that on  May  the bodies of Ricardo Garcia and Arnulfo Gmez, leaders of the Coca-Cola Workers' Union who had been kidnapped on  May, were found. The complainant also referred to the kidnapping, death and subsequent discovery of the corpses of peasants and workers, some of whom it mentioned by name, and to the murder of  workers on  May, among whom were Judith Gonzlez, Edgar Gonzlez Garcia and Manuel de Jess Flores.
.CPUSTAL also alleged that Guillermo Hernndez - Secretary of the Union of Central American Sanitation Workers (INCESA) -, Hugo Rolando Tello Gonzlez and Guillermo Hernndez Gmez - trade union leaders whose whereabouts are unknown - and Efraim Njera and Margarito Tzul - both workers - were all under arrest.
.The complainant added that on  April  the army brutally repressed the meeting of Coca-Cola workers who were discussing a problem of wages. Twenty-seven workers subsequently disappeared, although the Government denied that they were under arrest. Furthermore, according to CPUSTAL on  April  a group of  armed persons attacked, sacked and destroyed the premises of the CNT in Guatemala City, abducting  workers and beating up the watchman of the premises, Miguel Angel Olayo.
.CPUSTAL also alleged that a large number of written threats were received by  major trade union leaders, warning them to leave the country within  days, and stating that they would be killed if they did not do so.
.Finally, the complainant stated that on  March  the headquarters of the FASGUA trade union organisation in Escuintla was attacked with machine-gun fire.
.In a communication dated  June  the Government stated that on the day when the General Secretary of FASGUA was murdered by persons unknown, the Government issued precise instructions to the Detective Section of the National Police to investigate the case. The Government added that no information had been discovered concerning the deaths of the General Secretary and his wife, as the assassins had left no traces, but the police were continuing with their inquiries.
.The Committee keenly regretted that, despite repeated requests, the Government had not replied in detail to the allegations of the complainant, and that it therefore had been obliged to examine the case without having received detailed observations from the Government.
.The Committee deeply deplored the deaths and murders of trade union leaders and workers, and expressed its concern at the seriousness of the allegations.
.The Committee drew the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement could develop only under a regime which guarantees fundamental human rights and requested the Government, in view of the deaths which had occurred and the seriousness of the allegations, to adopt a policy for the taking of special measures to fully guarantee the rights to personal safety, protection against unjustified arrest and detention, the right of assembly and demonstration, and the protection of trade union premises and property.
.The Committee requested the Government to send its observations on the allegations made, in particular as to the death of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaint and as to the present situation of arrested workers and trade union leaders.
.Deaths, murders and disappearances
.The complainants refer to the following deaths:- Pedro Quevedo, Financial Secretary of the Guatemalan Bottling Company Workers' Union (EGSA), murdered on  December ;- Manuel Francisco Lpez Baln, General Secretary of the EGSA Workers' Union, murdered on  April ;- Miguel Archilla, trade union leader, killed by the police on  October  shortly after a demonstration by agricultural workers protesting against the dismissal of workers from the ISOTAL estate, which was violently dispersed;- Jos Len Castaeda, General Secretary of the Communication Workers' Union (SIMCOS), who was abducted on  November  and died under torture the following day;- Ricardo de Jess Monzon Noriega, a trade union leader of the El Salto SA sugar factory, murdered on  February  while returning from work;- Julio Villavicencio Morales, disputes secretary of a Puerto Barrios trade union, who died from bullet wounds received on  March  after leaving a trade union meeting;- Arnulfo Feliciano Lpez Velzquez, financial secretary of the Capri textile factory workers' union.

377,".The Committee examined Cases NOS. , , ,  and  at its November  Session.
.In view of the extremely serious nature of the allegations made in this case and the persistent failure of the Government to reply, despite the Committee's numerous requests and urgent appeals, the urgent appeal from the Director-General on  August  to the President of the Republic of Guatemala and the appeal made by the Chairman of the Committee when he met the Government representatives during the last session of the International Labour Conference, the Committee, in accordance with the procedure in force, submitted an interim report on the substance of the case although it had not received any observations from the Government.
.In stating its conclusions and recommendations, the Committee regretted the Government's failure to reply and expressed its deep concern at the seriousness of the allegations, including murders and violent physical attacks on a large number of trade union leaders, trade unionists and workers, arrests and disappearances of persons belonging to the trade union movement, threats, violations of the right to strike, violent interference in trade union meetings, the occupation of trade union premises, attacks on trade union property and dismissals for trade union activities.
.Consequently, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body decide to give to its report the widest possible distribution.
.That recommendation was given effect by sending the Committee's report to all the Governments of States Members of the International Labour Organisation.
.The Committee regrets that, since it submitted its report to the November  Session, the Government has chosen to ignore the Committee's recommendations that it send observations. Accordingly, the Committee can only reiterate the conclusions and recommendations - approved by the Governing Body - that it reached at its November  Sessions and again recommends that the Governing Body decide to give to this report the widest possible distribution.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not sent its observations, despite requests and urgent appeals by the Committee, the urgent appeal of the Director-General and the appeal made by the Chairman of the Committee during the last International Labour Conference. The Committee also regrets that the Government has chosen to ignore the recommendations it made at its November  Session - approved by the Governing Body at the same session - that observations should be sent.The Committee considers it useful again to remind the Government that the purpose of the procedure for the examination of complaints submitted to the Committee is to promote respect for trade union rights, both de jure and de facto, and that whereas the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the governments in turn must recognise the importance of sending detailed replies to the allegations so that an objective appraisal can be made. In this connection the Committee considers that the co-operation of governments in elucidating the questions referred to the Committee by the complainants is essential for promoting full respect for trade union rights and the normal development of the trade union movement.The Committee is extremely concerned at the seriousness of the allegations: murders, violent physical attacks on a large number of trade union leaders, trade unionists and workers, arrests and disappearances of persons linked to the trade union movement, threats, violations of the right to strike, violent interference in trade union meetings, the occupation of trade union premises and dismissals for trade union activities.The Committee considers it necessary again to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can only develop under a regime which respects and guarantees fundamental human rights. The Committee therefore requests the Government to adopt a policy providing for special measures to fully guarantee the right to personal security, adequate protection against unjustified arrest and detention, the right of assembly and demonstration for trade union purposes, and the protection of trade union premises and property.The Committee deeply deplores the numerous losses of human life and the injuries and ill-treatment suffered by those mentioned in the complaints. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the importance of a prompt and independent investigation of the alleged cases of death, assault and ill-treatment, with a view to elucidating the facts in full, identifying the persons responsible and instituting proceedings against them. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of these investigations.The Committee suggests that the Government be asked to inquire into the whereabouts and condition of the persons who have disappeared and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.The Committee recalls that governments should ensure that any person arrested is treated in accordance with the normal procedures and that his case is dealt with promptly, and points out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no subsequent grounds for conviction are found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights and may constitute serious interference in trade union activities.The Committee proposes that the Government be asked to take measures to secure the release of all those arrested owing to their membership of a trade union or involvement in trade union activities generally considered legitimate, and requests it to state the reasons for and circumstances of each arrest mentioned by the complainants, and also to report on the present condition of the persons arrested.The Committee requests the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to continue to pay special attention to the changes required in Guatemalan legislation concerning freedom of association.The Committee wishes that the attention of the Government be drawn to the fact that, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , workers' and employers' organisations should enjoy adequate protection against any interference in each other's activities.The Committee also recalls that Article  of Convention No.  provides that workers must enjoy adequate protection against any acts calculated to cause their dismissal by reason of their union membership or their participation in trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the court decision ordering the reinstatement of the  EGSA workers dismissed in April  is enforced, and to report to the Committee on the matter.
.Lastly, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body again decide to give to this report the widest possible distribution.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.

.These complaints involve allegations of murder, detention and torture of trade union leaders and trade unionists, their disappearance, threats made against them, and attacks on trade union premises and property by the armed forces. The complaints were transmitted to the Government of Guatemala as they were received.
.Owing to the lack of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned consideration of Case No.  at its meeting in May , of Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and of Case No.  at its meeting in February .
.The Committee noted at its May  meeting that the observations regarding Case No. , which the Committee requested from the Government at its meeting in May , had not yet been received. It therefore decided to make use of the procedure in force and presented an interim report on the substance of the case.
.In a communication dated  August  the Director General sent an urgent appeal to the President of the Republic of Guatemala. In this communication he voiced the growing concern on the part of the International Labour Organisation over the trade union situation in Guatemala, observing that the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body were currently examining several complaints of alleged violations of the freedom of association submitted by a number of international workers' organisations. The Director-General continued that in this connection the Chairman of the Committee on Freedom of Association had met the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare and the Permanent Representative Ambassador of Guatemala during the th International Labour Conference in Geneva in June , and had informed them that the Government needed to reply in detail to the Committee's requests for information.
.The Director-General also stated in his appeal that during this same period (June ) he had received telegrams from several international trade union bodies which referred to alleged violations of the freedom of association in Guatemala. In view of the seriousness and urgency of the events referred to in the telegrams, he requested the Minister for External Relations to supply him with the Government's observations as soon as possible.

.The complainants allege that Israel Neftal Mrquez, General Secretary of the EGSA workers' union, was forced to leave the country in March  after numerous attempts were made to kill him. Miguel Cifuentes, General Secretary of the Tacasa tobacco workers' union was forced to leave for the same reason in April .
.The complainants further allege that by the end of September  the largest central trade union body in the country, the CNT, had lost  of its  affiliated trade unions as a result of the methods used by the Government and the employers to destroy the trade unions: the adjournment of legal recognition of the unions for months or even years; occupation by the armed forces of factories, the employers being able to hire soldiers; the creation of (""amarillos"") trade unions dominated by factory owners; the artificial closure of factories later opened again under different names, with new staff and without a trade union, and finally, the use of intimidation.
.On  January , at midnight, according to the complainants, the police were summoned by the management to the EGSA factory, where they threatened to arrest the entire night shift consisting of  to  workers owing to the smashing of an old piece of equipment, which the management were hasty to term ""worker sabotage"".
.The complainants further allege that in the month of April  the management of EGSA dismissed  workers, including three trade union leaders, after the workers' union had appealed to the courts for a ruling ordering the continuation of negotiations for the renewal of a collective agreement which they had already obtained. Despite a ruling by the labour court for the reinstatement of all the dismissed workers, only the three trade union officials have been reinstated. Four of the  workers dismissed have agreed, under death threats, to accept their dismissal.
.With reference to the events of  April , when  armed men entered the CNT premises and arrested  trade unionists, the complainants state that the premises were destroyed and that their typewriters, copying machines and other office equipment were confiscated, and that the telephone line was cut.

.That recommendation was given effect by sending the Committee's report to all the Governments of States Members of the International Labour Organisation.
.The Committee regrets that, since it submitted its report to the November  Session, the Government has chosen to ignore the Committee's recommendations that it send observations. Accordingly, the Committee can only reiterate the conclusions and recommendations - approved by the Governing Body - that it reached at its November  Sessions and again recommends that the Governing Body decide to give to this report the widest possible distribution.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not sent its observations, despite requests and urgent appeals by the Committee, the urgent appeal of the Director-General and the appeal made by the Chairman of the Committee during the last International Labour Conference. The Committee also regrets that the Government has chosen to ignore the recommendations it made at its November  Session - approved by the Governing Body at the same session - that observations should be sent.The Committee considers it useful again to remind the Government that the purpose of the procedure for the examination of complaints submitted to the Committee is to promote respect for trade union rights, both de jure and de facto, and that whereas the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the governments in turn must recognise the importance of sending detailed replies to the allegations so that an objective appraisal can be made. In this connection the Committee considers that the co-operation of governments in elucidating the questions referred to the Committee by the complainants is essential for promoting full respect for trade union rights and the normal development of the trade union movement.The Committee is extremely concerned at the seriousness of the allegations: murders, violent physical attacks on a large number of trade union leaders, trade unionists and workers, arrests and disappearances of persons linked to the trade union movement, threats, violations of the right to strike, violent interference in trade union meetings, the occupation of trade union premises and dismissals for trade union activities.The Committee considers it necessary again to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can only develop under a regime which respects and guarantees fundamental human rights. The Committee therefore requests the Government to adopt a policy providing for special measures to fully guarantee the right to personal security, adequate protection against unjustified arrest and detention, the right of assembly and demonstration for trade union purposes, and the protection of trade union premises and property.The Committee deeply deplores the numerous losses of human life and the injuries and ill-treatment suffered by those mentioned in the complaints. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the importance of a prompt and independent investigation of the alleged cases of death, assault and ill-treatment, with a view to elucidating the facts in full, identifying the persons responsible and instituting proceedings against them. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of these investigations.The Committee suggests that the Government be asked to inquire into the whereabouts and condition of the persons who have disappeared and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.The Committee recalls that governments should ensure that any person arrested is treated in accordance with the normal procedures and that his case is dealt with promptly, and points out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no subsequent grounds for conviction are found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights and may constitute serious interference in trade union activities.The Committee proposes that the Government be asked to take measures to secure the release of all those arrested owing to their membership of a trade union or involvement in trade union activities generally considered legitimate, and requests it to state the reasons for and circumstances of each arrest mentioned by the complainants, and also to report on the present condition of the persons arrested.The Committee requests the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to continue to pay special attention to the changes required in Guatemalan legislation concerning freedom of association.The Committee wishes that the attention of the Government be drawn to the fact that, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , workers' and employers' organisations should enjoy adequate protection against any interference in each other's activities.The Committee also recalls that Article  of Convention No.  provides that workers must enjoy adequate protection against any acts calculated to cause their dismissal by reason of their union membership or their participation in trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the court decision ordering the reinstatement of the  EGSA workers dismissed in April  is enforced, and to report to the Committee on the matter.
.Lastly, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body again decide to give to this report the widest possible distribution.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.During  and  complaints regarding violations of freedom of association in Guatemala (Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) have been submitted by the following organisations: The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), The World Confederation of Labour (WCL), The Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), The International Union of Food and Allied Industries Workers (IUA) and the International Federation of Commercial, Clerical, Professional and Technical Employees (FIET).
.These complaints involve allegations of murder, detention and torture of trade union leaders and trade unionists, their disappearance, threats made against them, and attacks on trade union premises and property by the armed forces. The complaints were transmitted to the Government of Guatemala as they were received.
.Owing to the lack of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned consideration of Case No.  at its meeting in May , of Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and of Case No.  at its meeting in February .
.The Committee noted at its May  meeting that the observations regarding Case No. , which the Committee requested from the Government at its meeting in May , had not yet been received. It therefore decided to make use of the procedure in force and presented an interim report on the substance of the case.
.In a communication dated  August  the Director General sent an urgent appeal to the President of the Republic of Guatemala. In this communication he voiced the growing concern on the part of the International Labour Organisation over the trade union situation in Guatemala, observing that the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body were currently examining several complaints of alleged violations of the freedom of association submitted by a number of international workers' organisations. The Director-General continued that in this connection the Chairman of the Committee on Freedom of Association had met the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare and the Permanent Representative Ambassador of Guatemala during the th International Labour Conference in Geneva in June , and had informed them that the Government needed to reply in detail to the Committee's requests for information.
.The Director-General also stated in his appeal that during this same period (June ) he had received telegrams from several international trade union bodies which referred to alleged violations of the freedom of association in Guatemala. In view of the seriousness and urgency of the events referred to in the telegrams, he requested the Minister for External Relations to supply him with the Government's observations as soon as possible.
.The Director-General's appeal concluded by kindly requesting the President of the",0,1980,Guatemala
382,".The National Federation of Mineworkers and Metalworkers submitted a complaint of violation of trade union rights in Peru in a telegram dated  June . The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  April .
.As the statements made by the parties were contradictory, on  April  the Director-General, in accordance with the procedure of the Committee on Freedom of Association, asked the complainant organisation to transmit any observations which it might consider advisable on the Government's observations by  June  at the latest. The Committee has not received any communication since then.
.Peru has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication, the complainant organisation refers to the kidnapping in Lima of the trade union leader and miner, Aldo Morn, by Argentinian and Peruvian forces. It claims that his life and person are in danger.
.In its reply, the Government states that according to the inquiry carried out by the Senior Directorate of the Civil Guard and the Investigating Police, the trade union leader Aldo Morn has never been detained. In conclusion, it accordingly rejects the complaint as being completely baseless.
.The Committee notes that the complainant did not supply any details as to the circumstances of or reasons for the alleged arrest of Mr. Aldo Morn. It also points out that the complainant did not exercise its right to send additional information in support of its complaint and that it did not make any observations on the Government's reply which was transmitted to it by the Director General. In addition, the Committee notes that according to the competent Peruvian authorities the person concerned has not been detained.",0,1980,Peru
383,".In a telegram dated  June  the Latin-American Central of Workers (CLAT) presented a complaint concerning alleged infringements of the exercise of trade union rights in Peru. The text of this communication was transmitted to the Government, which presented its observations in a letter of  September .
.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisation alleges that, following the general strike of June , which was observed by , workers of the Social Security Institute,  trade union leaders were arrested.
.In its communication of  September , the Government indicates, on the basis of information obtained from the President of the Peruvian Social Security Institute, that the workers who followed the leaders of the Central Union of Workers of the Institute have not been penalised for taking part in the last work-stoppage launched by the Union. In addition, the Government affirms that the  trade union leaders referred to in the CLAT complaint have likewise not been imprisoned.
.In accordance with the established procedure the complainant organisation was informed of the Government's reply on  October , and was requested to submit its observations on the matter. Since then, it has not supplied any further information.
.The Committee thus notes that in its reply the Government has refuted the allegations concerning the arrest of the  trade union leaders in the course of a labour dispute at the Social Security institute and that the complainants have not contested this reply.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.",0,1980,Peru
384,".The complaint of the Railwaymen's Union of Central Peru and the Railway Employees' Union of Central Peru is contained in a communication dated  May . The Government sent its reply in communications dated  and  July .
.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The trade union organisations alleged that they went on strike on  July  in order to obtain an equitable redistribution of income and to preserve their source of work. AS a result of this stoppage,  national railway union leaders were detained and subsequently, on  August , notification of dismissal was served or  union leaders. In these circumstances, the railway workers' trade union organisations lodged a complaint of unjustified dismissal with the Ministry of Labour on  September  requesting the reinstatement of the dismissed workers and the payment of earnings which had been lost.
.In the light of the intransigent attitude adopted by the Government and employers, the railway workers held a national stoppage lasting  days in March . The Government appointed a commission which negotiated with the trade union leaders and the two directors of the Central and Southern Railways of Peru. An agreement was reached on  March  which put an end to the strike and which, the complainants maintain, stipulated that all  dismissed trade union leaders would be reinstated. However, the Government and the ENAFER-PERU Company reinstated only an selected number of workers and refused to re-engage  of the railway trade union leaders.
.The first communication of the Government was dated  July  and the second  July , i.e. two days after the installation of the Constitutional government. The communications stated that the five trade union leaders dismissed as a result of the strike of  July  have now been reinstated in their work.
.The Committee notes with interest that the five trade union leaders dismissed as a result of the strike of  July , have now been reinstated in their work.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further consideration.",0,1980,Peru
385,".The Federation of Municipal workers of Peru presented its complaint in a communication dated  May , and the Government replied in a letter dated  March .
.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The Federation of Municipal Workers of Peru alleges that, during the strike in Lima, of May , called for professional reasons - a salary increase, reinstatement of some of its members, full application of the collective agreement in force and payment of salaries for the days on strike - the police disrupted by violent means a peaceful meeting at the trade union premises, whereby killing three workers and seriously wounding others.
.In its communication of  March , the Government denies the accusations made against it. It remarks that according to the Ministry of Interior's report (which the Government has appended to its communication) drawn up by the Civil Guard (Emergency Squadron), at the time of the incident, the workers in question were far from conducting a peaceful meeting. Instead it was of violent and agitated, purely political character, bearing no relation to trade union matters, thereby causing disorder and disturbing public peace. The Government also states that one worker, and not three, as alleged by the complainant, was killed, and that he was shot by a gun of small calibre, not by the kind of gun carried by the Civil Guard (which is of different calibre).
.In the first place, as regards the violent incidents which occurred on the occasion of the meeting at the trade union premises during a strike, the Committee deplores the seriousness of the incident, particularly regarding the loss of life.
.The Committee notes that there is a clear contradiction between the complainant's allegations and the Government's reply concerning the developments and outcome of the events. It does not consider it has sufficient information at its disposal to enable it to decide if any violations of trade union rights took place.
.The Committee would also wish, in general, to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that intervention by security forces should be limited to the maintenance of public order.
.The Committee observes that the report supplied by the Government, concerning the investigation of the incidents in question, was drawn up by the Civil Guard, i.e. conducted by the Ministry of the Interior itself. In this respect, the Committee would wish, in general, to recall the principle, as it has already done on previous occasions, that in cases in which the dispersal of public meetings by the police for reasons of public order or other similar reasons, has involved a loss of life, it has attached special importance to the circumstances being fully investigated by an immediate and independent special inquiry and to the regular legal procedure being followed to determine the justification and responsibility for the action taken by the police. In this case it seems that no independent judicial investigation took place.
.The Committee can only express its concern at these incidents. In cases involving the loss of life of trade unionists the Committee has stressed the need to carry out a full and impartial inquiry in order to elucidate the facts and determine responsibility.
.The Committee would request the Government, as it has already done on other occasions, to institute as soon as possible, if it has not already done so, an independent judicial inquiry with a view to elucidating the facts in full and determining responsibilities given that, according to the Government, the inquiry was carried out by the Ministry of the Interior. The Committee asks the Government to inform it of the results of the judicial inquiry.",0,1980,Peru
386,".The complaint is contained in several communications from the Single Union of Employees of SCALA (SUTS) dated  March,  and  April and  May . The Government sent its observations on  July .
.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Eight to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Eight to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant's allegations concern the dismissal of  workers by the firm of SCALA on the ground that they had taken part in a sit-down strike lasting six hours on  January  in protest against the firm's refusal to accede to the wage demands of the workers, who had rejected as being insufficient the increase awarded by the labour authorities through Sub-Directoral Order No. -. The complainant claims that the stoppage of  January  took place peacefully with no disturbance of public order and that no damage was done to the company's premises or property.
.The SUTS applied to the officiating Chief of the Complaints Division for the reinstatement of the dismissed workers, claiming that the strike had involved no breach of the law. The union asserted that the purpose behind the mass dismissal was to enable the company to negotiate the reinstatement of the workers in return for acceptance of small wage increase, there being precedents for this.
.By Ministerial Order No. -- of  March , confirmed on appeal, the Second Complaints Division stated that the stoppage of work at SCALA S.A. had been declared illegal and that the workers dismissed had behaved violently, preventing the public from entering the building and doing business with the company by taking possession of the doors and installations, and uttering insults and offensive slogans about the company and some of its officials, these facts having been confirmed by the investigations carried out by the competent authorities. For these reasons it rejected the application for reinstatement filed by the SUTS.
.In its reply the Government refers to the orders made in respect of the application filed by the SUTS and concludes by stating that ""there has been no denial of freedom of association nor failure to protect the right to organise, since the workers were not dismissed for participating in the stoppage ordered by their trade union but for misusing the right to strike and adopting hostile attitudes irrelevant to the exercise of a right which is fully recognised by our legislation"".
.The Committee observes that the complainant's version and the Government's version contradict each other. Irrespective of which version is correct, the Committee notes that the workers concerned were dismissed on account of their activities in connection with a stoppage lasting six hours, which according to the Government was effected in an unlawful and violent manner, whereas the complainant claims that it took place peacefully. The Committee wishes to emphasise, as it has done in previous cases, that labour relations could be greatly improved if the employers concerned gave serious consideration to the possibility of reinstating the persons affected. It has also emphasised on earlier occasions that serious risks of abuse and threats to freedom of association are involved in dismissals arising out of strikes and that the adoption of an inflexible attitude in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers is certain to impair the development of labour relations. In the present case, the Committee observes that, even though the authorities did note a work stoppage, it only lasted six hours. The Committee is accordingly of the opinion that it would be appropriate for the Government to take steps to facilitate the reinstatement of the workers dismissed.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to suggest to the Government that in order to restore an industrial climate more propitious to the development of good labour relations it should take steps to facilitate the reinstatement of the workers dismissed;(b) to request the Government to keep the Committee informed as to the measures taken to the effect indicated in the preceding subparagraph.",0,1980,Peru

.Peru has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.UISAFP alleges that Mr. Cristbal Sebastin, a militant of the National Confederation of Agriculture and the trade union representative of the native company AMUESHA, was arrested because of his trade union activities with the peasants of this company whom he had helped in gaining the title to the land which they worked.
.In its reply dated  July , the Government states that, according to information obtained from the Ministry of the Interior, Cristbal Sebastian had not been arrested nor requested to , appear before the Security Services.
.According to the procedure in force, the complainant organisation was informed on  July  of the Government's reply and was requested to submit its observations on the question before  September .
.Since then the complainant organisation has sent no additional information. Moreover, the Committee notes that the complaint does not contain any precise information as to the reasons and circumstances of Mr. Cristbal Sebastin's arrest.

He also asked the President to communicate any information on the measures that might be taken as regards this serious situation.
.No reply has been received to the communication sent to the President of the Republic of Guatemala by the Director-General.
.At its meeting in November , the Committee observed that in spite of the time which had elapsed, the observations of the Government on Case No.  had not been received and requested it to send them urgently.
.At its meeting in February , the Committee noted with regret that it had still not received the Government's observations regarding Cases Nos. , , ,  and  in view of the extremely serious nature of the allegations the Committee again requested the Government to reply urgently.
.At its May  meeting the Committee noted that, despite repeated requests, the Government had sent no reply. The Committee therefore decided to apply to Cases Nos. , , ,  and  the procedure contained in the Committee's th Report according to which the Chairman of the Committee would make contact with the Government's representatives in order to have an exchange of views on the cases in question.
.In accordance with the Committee's decision, the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare and the Permanent Representative Ambassador of Guatemala in Geneva on  June . The Chairman referred to the persistent failure of the Government of Guatemala to reply to all the communications concerning the cases before the Committee which had been sent to it during the previous year, in particular the letter sent personally by the Director-General of the ILO to the President of the Republic of Guatemala on  August .
.The Chairman of the Committee added that the failure to reply was particularly serious in view of the fact, that four of the five cases involved the death or arrest of trade union leaders.
.The Minister expressed his surprise that the President of the Republic had not replied to the Director-General's letter, and stated that he would do all he could be obtain a reply.
.The Minister also stated that he would do everything possible to reply in writing before returning to Guatemala. To make this task easier a copy of the Director-General's letter was delivered to him on  June, together with copies of all the relevant communications which had been sent concerning Cases nos. , , ,  and .
.Apart from a brief communication dated  June  concerning one aspect of Case No. , which was examined by the Committee at its meeting in May  when it presented an interim report on this case, the Government has not sent any observations on the cases in question.

.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As stated above, the Committee examined Case No.  at its meeting in May  and presented an interim report.
.CPUSTAL had alleged that Rodolfo Ramirez, General Secretary of the Autonomous Trade Union. Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) and his wife were murdered on  April , together with Maximo Velsquez Melgar, Secretary of the Trade Union of the Hemp Sack Factory, who was treacherously murdered as he was leaving work on  March . CPUSTAL added that on  May  the bodies of Ricardo Garcia and Arnulfo Gmez, leaders of the Coca-Cola Workers' Union who had been kidnapped on  May, were found. The complainant also referred to the kidnapping, death and subsequent discovery of the corpses of peasants and workers, some of whom it mentioned by name, and to the murder of  workers on  May, among whom were Judith Gonzlez, Edgar Gonzlez Garcia and Manuel de Jess Flores.
.CPUSTAL also alleged that Guillermo Hernndez - Secretary of the Union of Central American Sanitation Workers (INCESA) -, Hugo Rolando Tello Gonzlez and Guillermo Hernndez Gmez - trade union leaders whose whereabouts are unknown - and Efraim Njera and Margarito Tzul - both workers - were all under arrest.
.The complainant added that on  April  the army brutally repressed the meeting of Coca-Cola workers who were discussing a problem of wages. Twenty-seven workers subsequently disappeared, although the Government denied that they were under arrest. Furthermore, according to CPUSTAL on  April  a group of  armed persons attacked, sacked and destroyed the premises of the CNT in Guatemala City, abducting  workers and beating up the watchman of the premises, Miguel Angel Olayo.
.CPUSTAL also alleged that a large number of written threats were received by  major trade union leaders, warning them to leave the country within  days, and stating that they would be killed if they did not do so.
.Finally, the complainant stated that on  March  the headquarters of the FASGUA trade union organisation in Escuintla was attacked with machine-gun fire.
.In a communication dated  June  the Government stated that on the day when the General Secretary of FASGUA was murdered by persons unknown, the Government issued precise instructions to the Detective Section of the National Police to investigate the case. The Government added that no information had been discovered concerning the deaths of the General Secretary and his wife, as the assassins had left no traces, but the police were continuing with their inquiries.
.The Committee keenly regretted that, despite repeated requests, the Government had not replied in detail to the allegations of the complainant, and that it therefore had been obliged to examine the case without having received detailed observations from the Government.
.The Committee deeply deplored the deaths and murders of trade union leaders and workers, and expressed its concern at the seriousness of the allegations.
.The Committee drew the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement could develop only under a regime which guarantees fundamental human rights and requested the Government, in view of the deaths which had occurred and the seriousness of the allegations, to adopt a policy for the taking of special measures to fully guarantee the rights to personal safety, protection against unjustified arrest and detention, the right of assembly and demonstration, and the protection of trade union premises and property.

Regarding the arrest of Guillermo Hernandez Gomez, Secretary of the sanitation workers' union (INCESA), which was referred to in the allegations concerning Case No. , the complainants report that this in fact took place on  March  when the police intervened in a demonstration of workers at the CAMSA furniture factory.
.The complainants further allege that on  June , after the murders of Edgar Ren Aldama and Oscar Amilcar Tatuaca, the CNT Executive Committee met delegates of the trade unions concerned at the headquarters of the CNT to discuss what action should be taken and to discuss a possible demonstration to protest against the murders. During the discussion a group of  heavily armed men, claiming to be members of the state security forces, blocked traffic in the street of Guatemala City next to the CNT headquarters, broke down the door with a jeep, broke up the meeting and arrested  trade unionists, who were led in small groups to unknown destinations. The national police claim that they have no knowledge of the whereabouts of these arrested people, whose names are as follows: Ismael Vzquez Ortiz, Orlando Prez and Florentino Gmez Lpez (members of the EGSA workers' union), Mario Martinez and Luis Rodolfo Bonilla (members of the Foremost dairy workers' union), Bernardo Marroquin Salazar, Antonio Rodriguez Ramos and Rafael Antonio Aguilar Prez (members of the Kerns Food Products union), Florencia Xocop Chvez, Gonzalo Vzquez, Manuel Snchez and Oscar Salazar (members of the CNT organising Committee), Sonia Furio (member of the BIC union), Irma Prez Osorio and Hilda Carlota Prez Menndez (General Secretary and member respectively of the INDUPLASTIC union), Sara Cabrera Flores (General Secretary of the AGRICASA union). The other names are: Orlando Garca Rodriguez, Irma Barrio, Cristina Yolanda Carrera, Irving Ren Hernndez Paiz, Selvin Arnoldo Garca Lpez,",-1,1980,Guatemala
390,"Sonia Alecio, Crescencio Coronel Ordoez, Jorge Luis Serrano, Jorge Zamora, Manuel Ren Polanco Salguero and Mario Campos Valladares.
.The complainants add that on  July , So armed men entered the EGSA factory where the workers were on strike and occupying the factory, and abducted two workers, both members of the EGSA workers' union. One of them, Marcelino Santos Chacn, was later released after being assaulted and interrogated by the police.
.On  August , the complainants claim,  trade union leaders were arrested by the national police at the Emauz estate (Escuintla) when they were holding a meeting. They were later transferred to the national police headquarters in Guatemala City. The arrested include: Gustavo Adolfo Bejarano, Guillermo Alberto Moreno Valencia, Juan Guerra, Rafael Girn Mrida, Guillermo Turcios, Edgar de la Cruz, Augusto Yach Ciriaco, Iliana de la Cruz, Roldn Alberto Salazar Uriza, Alfonso Molina Mrida, and the director of the Emauz estate, Jos Luis Pea.
.Finally, in a communication dated  May , the WCL submitted a list of other trade union leaders and workers who have been arrested. The trade union officials on this list include: Marco Antonio Yuntuche Lpez, arrested  November ; Pedro Ignacio Tobar Guzmn -  February ; Antonio Benvenuto Serrano -  May  (the latter two are being held in Guatemala City); Jos Morales Lpez -  September ; Victor Rivas Paiz and Adn Velsquez Duarte -  August . The trade unionists on the same list include: Marco Antonio Blanco - arrested  October ; Juan Lopreto Balux and Plcido Reyes -  December ; Jorge Enrique Garca Castellanos -  January  (in detention in Guatemala City); Manuel Enrique Meja -  August ; Juan de Dios Aguilar, Saturnino Cifuentes Salazar and Luis Gonzlez Bahur -  September ; Jorge Callejas Cruz -  December  (being held in Guatemala City); Agustin Chitay Chapton, Alvaro Oswaldo Estrada, Toms Roberto Poll and Pedro Ramos Micatu -  June  (also being held in Guatemala City); Victor Herrera, Adalberto Jurez, Rosario Leal, Nery Robledo Espinoza and Jos Ruiz, arrested on  August  (currently being held in Paln, Escuintla).
.Further allegations
.The complainants allege that Israel Neftal Mrquez, General Secretary of the EGSA workers' union, was forced to leave the country in March  after numerous attempts were made to kill him. Miguel Cifuentes, General Secretary of the Tacasa tobacco workers' union was forced to leave for the same reason in April .
.The complainants further allege that by the end of September  the largest central trade union body in the country, the CNT, had lost  of its  affiliated trade unions as a result of the methods used by the Government and the employers to destroy the trade unions: the adjournment of legal recognition of the unions for months or even years; occupation by the armed forces of factories, the employers being able to hire soldiers; the creation of (""amarillos"") trade unions dominated by factory owners; the artificial closure of factories later opened again under different names, with new staff and without a trade union, and finally, the use of intimidation.
.On  January , at midnight, according to the complainants, the police were summoned by the management to the EGSA factory, where they threatened to arrest the entire night shift consisting of  to  workers owing to the smashing of an old piece of equipment, which the management were hasty to term ""worker sabotage"".
.The complainants further allege that in the month of April  the management of EGSA dismissed  workers, including three trade union leaders, after the workers' union had appealed to the courts for a ruling ordering the continuation of negotiations for the renewal of a collective agreement which they had already obtained. Despite a ruling by the labour court for the reinstatement of all the dismissed workers, only the three trade union officials have been reinstated. Four of the  workers dismissed have agreed, under death threats, to accept their dismissal.
.With reference to the events of  April , when  armed men entered the CNT premises and arrested  trade unionists, the complainants state that the premises were destroyed and that their typewriters, copying machines and other office equipment were confiscated, and that the telephone line was cut.
.Finally, in a communication dated  March , the ICFTU alleges that a Draft Labour Code submitted to the Congress of the Republic of Guatemala by the Ministry of Labour and Social welfare and due, in principle, to come into force on  May , contained several provisions which are not in conformity with Convention No.  (Case No. ).
.The complaint is contained in communications from the Permanent Congress for Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL) dated  April and  May . The Government sent observations in a communication of  June .
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.CPUSTAL alleges that freedom of association and the most basic human rights have been violated in Guatemala; in particular, it denounces the repression persecution and murder of workers and trade union leaders.
.The complainant alleges that Rodolfo Ramirez, General Secretary of the Autonomous Trade Union Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) and his wife were murdered on  April , together with Mximo Velsquez Melgar, Secretary of the Union of the Hemp Sack Factory, who was treacherously murdered as he was leaving his work. CPUSTAL adds that the bodies of Ricardo Garcia and Arnulfo Gmez, leaders of the Coca-Cola Workers' Union, who had been kidnapped on  May , were found on  May. The complainant also refers to the kidnapping and deaths of peasants and workers, whose corpses were subsequently found, stating the names of some of the persons concerned, and to the murder on  May of  workers, among whom were Judhit Gonzlez, Edgar Gonzlez and Manuel de Jess Flores.
.CPUSTAL also alleges the arrest of Guillermo Hernndez, Secretary of the Union of Industria Centroamericana de Sanitarios (INCESA), the trade union leaders Hugo Rolando Tello Gonzlez and Guillermo Hernndez Gmez - whose whereabouts are unknown - and the workers Efram Njera and Margarito Tzul.
.The complainant adds that on  April  the army savagely suppressed the assembly of the Coca-Cola workers as they were discussing a wage problem;  workers disappeared, but it is denied that they have been arrested. Furthermore, states the complainant, on  April  an armed band of  persons attacked, sacked and destroyed the premises of the CNT in Guatemala City, capturing and carrying off  workers and beating up the watchman of the premises, Miguel Angel Olayo, with the butts of their weapons.
.CPUSTAL also alleges that leaflets were widely distributed ordering  major trade union leaders to leave the country within  days, failing which they would be killed.
.Lastly, the complainant alleges that on  March  the headquarters of the FASGUA trade union organisation in Escuintla was attacked with machine-gun fire.
.In its communication of  June , the Government states that on the day when the General Secretary of FASGUA was murdered by persons unknown, the Government gave precise instructions to the Detective Section of the National Police to investigate the case. The Government adds that it has not been possible to clarify the circumstances surrounding the death of this trade union leader and that of his wife because the murderers left no traces; the police are, however, continuing with their investigations.
.The Committee had to postpone its examination of the present case at its May  meeting because it had not received the observations which it had requested of the Government, Subsequently, the Director-General addressed a pressing appeal to the President of the Republic of Guatemala, stating the need for the Government to reply in detail to the Committee's request for information. As the allegations referred to violent deaths, mistreatment and arrests of trade union leaders, the Committee included the case under the heading ""Urgent appeals"" in the reports on its November  and February  sessions, earnestly requesting the Government to send its observations on the allegations urgently. Since the Committee had had to postpone its examination of the case from its May  session, it informed the Government at its last session that, in conformity with the procedure in force, it could present a report on the substance of the case at its next session even if the Government's observations had not yet been received. The Committee has still not received these observations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee considers it necessary to recall the considerations which it set forth in its first report and which it has had occasion to repeat at various times, namely that the purpose of the whole procedure is to promote respect for trade union rights in law and in fact, and the Committee is confident that, if it protects governments against unreasonable accusations, governments on their side will recognise the importance of formulating for objective",-1,1980,Guatemala
391,"to represent them in negotiations and in disputes.
.The Government next refers to the large-scale politicisation of the trade unions which had resulted in innumerable strikes and work stoppages over the last  months, with resulting damage to the economy of the country. In. support, the Government supplies a statistical table on the labour disputes over this period.
.The Government denies the allegations concerning the demolition of the trade union premises. It states that, on the contrary, it has decided to erect a modern building which will replace the dilapidated premises of the COB and will serve not only as the headquarters of this organisation but also for the benefit of all workers thanks to the inclusion of several levels of car parking.
.In an appendix to its communication, the Government supplies information on  persons who had been mentioned by the complainants. It appears from this information that  of them are restricted to a specified town,  have not been detained,  are in exile,  are at liberty and  has died in Geneva where he had been living for score years. The Committee noted that the names largely corresponded to those communicated by the complainants.
.The allegations made in the present case refer to the violent deaths of trade union leaders and the arrest of large numbers of trade unionists, to the dissolution of the Bolivian Central of workers and of the existing trade unions, and to the measures taken against the members of an international trade union mission.
.Before considering each of the questions raised by the complainants, the Committee wishes to express its deep concern at the gravity of certain allegations, and to recall as a general principle that a truly free and independent trade union movement can only develop where fundamental human rights are respected.
.The Committee observes in the first place that the Government has supplied no information regarding the death of fifteen trade union leaders who are said to have been shot, nor on the death of the Miners' Federation leader, Gualberto Vega. In this connection the Committee can only urge the Government to supply its observations on these allegations and detailed information on the precise circumstances of the death of these trade union leaders if it is true that they are no longer alive.
.As to the allegations concerning the arrests of trade unionists, the Committee notes that according to the Government the majority of these persons have not been arrested. It appears however from the information received that a significant number of them have been restricted to specified towns and that a few have been exiled. The Government has given no information on the precise grounds for these measures. Finally, some persons have been released.
.As the Committee has already had occasion to point out in earlier cases, although the fact of exercising trade union activity or holding trade union office does not give immunity from the application of normal penal law, the absence of guarantees of due process of law may lead to abuses and allow trade union officials to be penalised pursuant to decisions based on groundless accusations. It may also create a climate of insecurity and fear which may be prejudicial to the exercise of trade union rights, and the Committee has often drawn attention to the risks of violations of trade union rights involved in the detention of trade unionists against whom no grounds for accusation are subsequently found; accordingly, the Government should take steps to forestall the risk of unjustified arrests. The Committee has also considered that the granting to a trade unionist of his freedom on condition that he leaves the country although a less harsh measure is not compatible with the free exercise of trade union rights.
.The Committee has taken note of the Government's statement that suspects who are restricted, prosecuted or arrested can, at their request, be exiled. In this connection, the Committee must emphasise, as it has in the past, that the granting of his freedom to a trade unionist on condition that he leaves the country, although a less drastic measure than detention, cannot be considered compatible with the exercise of trade union rights. Similarly, restriction to a specified town, which also deprives trade unionists of the opportunity to carry on their trade union activities, is also a measure incompatible with the normal enjoyment of the right of association, Such restrictions should also be subject to appropriate judicial safeguards operating within a reasonable time and in particular to the protection of the right of the persons concerned to a fair trial as soon as possible.
.In addition, the Committee wishes to ask the Government to supply information on the present position of the other persons mentioned in the complaints.
.The Committee has taken note of the contents of Presidential Decree No.  of  July respecting the dissolution of the trade unions of active and inactive workers, except the Transport Workers' Union which, according to the Decree, has acted within the trade union context and remained on the fringe of any political activity. It has also taken note of Presidential Decree No.  of  August to provide for the appointment of workers' representatives to perform trade union functions pending the establishment of a new trade union organisation. In this connection the Committee wishes to stress that under Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Bolivia, workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority. The Committee would like to lay particular emphasis on this principle in the present case, since the measures in question affect almost all the trade union organisations in the country and accordingly have extremely serious implications for the defence of the occupational interests of Bolivian workers.
.The Committee notes that the Government has authorised the creation of groups of labour relations agents, elected by workers' Committees to represent the workers. The Committee considers however that such groups cannot be a substitute for the trade union organisations which the Bolivian workers had freely set up. It wishes to recall the importance attaching to the right of workers to join the organisations of their choice.
.As regards the arrest of the ICFTU members on a mission to Bolivia, the Committee notes that the persons concerned, following their arrest and maltreatment, have been released and expelled from the territory. The Committee nevertheless considers it necessary to ask the Government to supply information on the allegation that a sum of money carried by the members of the mission was confiscated.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that a representative of the Director-General has visited the country to examine the trade union situation on the spot, jointly with the Government;(b) to express its deep concern at the gravity of certain allegations and to recall as a general principle that a truly free and independent trade union movement can only develop where fundamental human rights are respected;(c) to urge the Government to supply its observations on the allegations concerning the death of trade union leaders and to communicate information on the precise circumstances of these deaths if it is true that these persons are no longer alive;(d) to note that certain persons mentioned by the complainants have been released but that a significant number of other persons have been either restricted to specified towns or exiled;(e) consequently, to recall to the Government the principles and considerations set out in paragraphs  and  above concerning measures of arrest, restriction to specified towns and exile, and in particular the importance of the existence of appropriate judicial safeguards and to ask the Government to supply information on the present position of the other trade unionists mentioned in the complaints;(f) to call the Government's particular attention to Article  of Convention No, , ratified by Bolivia, according to which workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority;(g) to express the firm hope that the Bolivian trade unions will soon be returned to their previous status and that the proposed new legislation will be in full conformity with Conventions Nos.  and , and that in revising the trade union legislation the Government will, as it has indicated is its intention, seek the advice and co-operation of the ILO, and to request the Government to supply information on the progress made in the adoption of this legislation and on the evolution of the trade union situation;(h) to note that the members of the ICFTU who were arrested during a mission to Bolivia have been released and expelled but, in the absence of observations from the Government on this point, to request it to provide information on the alleged confiscation of a sum of money carried by the members of the mission;(i) to take note of the present interim report.Geneva,  November .

392,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the General Confederation of Workers (CGT) dated  July . The Government replied by a communication of  October .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July , CGT alleges that the workers of the Zublin-Carrez undertaking engaged in the construction of a wharf at Puerto Limn were again obliged to resort to strike action on  June  because the company had failed to honour the commitments it had entered into in a settlement that had put an end to an earlier strike. Once again, continues the complainant, instead of negotiating seriously with the union, the undertaking is manoeuvring to defeat the workers' struggle, and is even obliging the Government to send in the forces of order to ""protect the interests of the workers"".
.CGT alleges that on  July  a member of the forces' of order cold-bloodedly shot Alvaro Picado, a worker who was on a loading machine, when a group of unarmed workers were attempting to persuade strike-breakers not to enter the workplace, although there had been no clashes either with the forces of order or with the strike-breakers.
.In its communication of  October  the Government states that the strike which began on  June  was declared illegal by the courts. The employer was accordingly entitled to terminate the contracts of employment of the strikers (section  of the Labour Code), and the courts had the power to order the police authorities to guarantee the continuation of work (section  of the Labour Code). Given the consequences of the illegal strike, the Ministry of Labour and Social Security, with a view to ensuring social peace, decided to act as a mediator; the result of this action was a settlement between the parties on the basis of proposals by the Government concerning reinstatement of the workers, termination of individual contracts and statutory benefits, trade union activity and the establishment of a Labour Relations Board. These proposals were accepted by the parties on  July .
.The Government remarks that the intervention of the police at the workplace was not due to pressure by the employer, but, given the illegal nature of the strike, was the result of a court order to apply section  of the Labour Code for the purpose of ensuring that workers who wished to continue work could enter the workplace.
.As regards the death of the worker Alvaro Picado, the Government states that a detachment of police was at the entrance to the worksite of the harbour installation in order to guarantee that workers who wished to continue work might enter the workplace and to protect the installations which were intended as a public service in accordance with section  of the Labour Code, when a group of workers attacked the authorities, throwing stones and other blunt objects. At a certain moment, Alvaro Picado, who was driving a vehicle equipped with a mechanical shovel, pushed with the shovel a loading vehicle against a but containing a number of policemen. The Government adds that the police fired into the air and warned the strikers to stop the violence. It was then discovered that Alvaro Picado, who was to die later, was lying on the ground with a bullet wound. Faced with this situation, most of the aggressors fled.
.The Government does not accept the complainant's accusation of responsibility for the incidents, as the action taken by the Civil Guard was in any case undoubtedly defensive. Furthermore, continues the Government, caches of arms of a type not used by the police were found on the premises, and various witnesses heard exchanges of shots of different calibres.
.In addition the Government remarks that during the preliminary investigation for homicide the civil guard who was originally held responsible for the death of Alvaro Picado was acquitted for lack of evidence because of the absence of any witness who could testify that the police had opened fire on the victim and because it was not even possible to determine that it was the shots fired by the forces of order that had caused his death.
.Although the Government has not explained the precise reasons, the Committee notes that the strike which began on  June  in the Zublin-Carrez undertaking was declared illegal and also notes that it was brought to an end when the parties accepted the settlement proposed by the Government. The Committee wishes to point out, as it has done in earlier cases, that the conditions required by law for a strike to be considered lawful must be reasonable, and in any case should not imply a serious limitation on the potential activities of trade unions, such as the requirement that a high proportion of the workers should be in agreement with the strike before it can be considered lawful.
.As regards the presence of the police at the workplace due to the labour dispute, the Committee notes the statement of the Government that the purpose of this was to ensure that workers who so wished could continue their work and to protect public service installations in accordance with the provisions of the Labour Code respecting illegal strikes. As regards the death of the worker, Alvaro Picado, the Committee observes that the allegations of the complainant and the statement of the Government are contradictory; the complainant states that a member of the forces of order fired on unarmed workers, although there had been no clashes either with the forces of order or with the strike-breakers, whereas the Government states that the workers had committed acts of aggression and that it was not possible to determine whether the shot which caused the victim's death came from the police. As it has already done on similar occasions, the Committee wishes to recall that it has always attached great importance to the institution of an impartial inquiry and the guarantee of due process of law in order to determine responsibilities and apply the corresponding sanctions in cases where disturbances have occurred involving the loss of human lives, In this sense the Committee observes that a preliminary investigation was carried out and that one of the civil guards was acquitted for lack of evidence.
.Lastly, given the violence of the incidents which occurred during the strike and which reached their climax with the death of the worker, Alvaro Picado, the Committee, while deploring these incidents, wishes to stress the desirability of giving the police appropriate instructions whenever they have to intervene in collective labour disputes, in order to avoid serious consequences of this kind.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to deplore the death of the worker Alvaro Picado and the violence of the incidents which took place during the strike, and to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that conditions required by law for a strike to be considered lawful should not constitute a serious limitation on the potential activities of trade union organisations.",1,1980,Costa Rica

.Since its last examination of the case, the Committee has received a communication from the Government dated  December  and another dated  January .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations in this case related to the strike held on  May  by the workers of Staves, Barrels and Parquet Inc. (STABAPARI), following repeated demands by the complainant organisation for the application of the collective agreement in force and the dismissal of  workers without respecting the terms of that agreement. The complainant also referred to the dismissal of another  workers on the day after the agreement putting an end to the strike was signed, and to the failure on the part of the Government and the undertaking to observe that agreement.
.It further referred to alleged acts of physical assault by the undertaking's manager against workers and to alleged antiunion interference by the Ministry of Labour (officials of the Ministry of Labour had called a meeting in order to induce the workers to give up their trade union organisation and appoint in its place a labour relations board).
.Regarding the pending questions, the Committee recommended to the Governing Body to request the Government for the text of the judgement in the case against the manager of the undertaking and for its observations on the alleged anti-union interference.
.In its communication of  January , the Government states that as the Public Prosecutor had considered that there was no proof to support the allegation of assault made by the complainant against the undertaking's manager and in the absence of charges laid against him by the trade union leaders of the complainant organisation or by anyone else - regarding which the Government sends a certification - the criminal courts did not intervene in the matter.
.In its communications, the Government also states that the alleged anti-union interference referred to by the complainant in its confused communication of  August  does not relate to the labour dispute at the STABAPARI undertaking but concerns a dispute at another undertaking, which terminated in an agreement, signed by the trade union representatives among others, agreeing to the establishment of the labour relations board mentioned in the allegations.
.The Committee notes that the complainant organisation did not bring charges before the courts in relation to the alleged intent of the manager of the STABAPARI undertaking to commit physical assault against workers and that the criminal courts did not intervene in the matter as the Public Prosecutor found there to be no proof in this respect.
.The Committee also notes that the allegations relating to the alleged anti-union interference referred to by the complainant does not relate to the labour dispute at the STABAPARI undertaking but concern another dispute at another undertaking which terminated in an agreement, signed by the trade union representatives and agreeing to the establishment of the labour relations board mentioned in the allegations.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in communications from the National Union of Workers in the Construction, Wood and Building Materials industries dated  July and  August . The Government replied by communication of  September .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.In its communication of  July  the National Union of Workers in the Construction, Wood and Building Materials Industries alleges that in response to its repeated demands for the application of the collective agreement in force, the undertaking Staves, Barrels and Parquet Inc. (STABAPARI) dismissed  workers, including  trade union leaders, without respecting the terms of the agreement in certain cases. For this reason, adds the complainant, a strike began on  May , which was subsequently declared illegal. Furthermore, says the complainant, the manager of STABAPARI drove his car at a number of workers who were standing at the entrance to the undertaking and later used a firearm. On  June , continues the complainant, an agreement was signed between the trade union and the representatives of the Government under which the workers undertook to put an end to the strike and the Government to grant a can be cover the statutory benefits to which the dismissed workers were entitled and the benefits for any workers who had taken part in the strike and who might later be dismissed for this reason. The complainant adds that  workers were dismissed on the day following the signature of the agreement and that the workers were later told that they would have to reimburse the loans which they had received in the event that the courts pronounced the dismissals justified.
.In its communication of  August  the complainant organisation states that neither the Government nor the undertaking has kept its promises. The complainant adds that officials of the Ministry of Labour, with the consent of the STABAPARI undertaking, called a meeting in which the union leadership was prevented from taking part in order to induce the workers to abandon their trade union organisation and appoint in its place a ""labour relations board"" in harmony with the interests of the undertaking.
.In its communication of  September  the Government states that the alleged acts of physical assault of which the complainant accuses the manager of the undertaking are awaiting confirmation by the courts. The Government adds that the Ministry of Labour granted economic aid to the dismissed workers out of its own funds and that, thanks to its intervention, the STABAPARI undertaking paid the sums it owed to the workers for the remaining period of their contract. As for the other statutory benefits (pay in lieu of notice and severance pay), the Government states that since these were granted in the form of loans under the agreement of  June  the workers concerned are obliged to reimburse them if the courts consider the dismissals to be justified. The Government has sent information on the initiation of the procedure for the granting of such cans.
.As regards the alleged acts of physical assault against workers of which the manager of STABAPARI is accused, the Committee takes note of the Government's statement that proceedings have been brought before the courts.
.The Committee also notes that the Government has granted the dismissed workers economic assistance and that the undertaking has paid all the sums which it owed to the dismissed workers at the time of dismissal.
.As regards pay in lieu of notice and severance pay, the Committee observes that the agreement of  June , concluded between the Government authorities and the trade union, provides for the granting of a loan for the payment of this compensation. The Committee also observes that according to the said agreement, any workers whose dismissal is held to be justified by the court will have to reimburse the sums received under these headings. Finally, the Committee observes that although it would appear that the Government has initiated the procedure for obtaining the loans, this procedure is not yet completed.
.As regards the dismissals recorded at the STABAPARI undertaking the Committee notes that  of them took place after the repeated demands made by the trade union for the application of the collective agreements and that the remaining  took place on the day after the signature of the agreement which put an end to the strike. In this connection the Committee must point out that such a large number of dismissals (the undertaking had  workers) on the occasion of labour disputes involves serious risks of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association and may impair the development of labour relations. For this reason the Committee feels that it would be advisable to take measures to review the situation of the dismissed workers as far as possible, particularly any workers who have been dismissed from their posts for reasons connected with their trade union activities.
.Lastly, the Committee remarks that the Government has so far made no response to the complainant's communication of  August  regarding the purported interference of ministry of Labour officials in STABAPARI to induce the workers to abandon their trade union organisation.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to request the Government to send the text of the judgement in the case against the manager of the STABAPARI undertaking;(b) to request the Government to take the necessary steps to conclude the procedure which it has initiated for the grant of the loans promised to the dismissed workers;(c) to draw the Government's attention to the principles set forth in paragraph  above regarding the serious risks to the development of labour relations that may be involved if very large numbers",1,1980,Costa Rica
395,".The Committee examined this case at its meeting in February  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body which requested certain information from the Government. The Government furnished additional information in a communication dated  April .
.Costa Rica has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The allegations concerned the labour dispute which occurred in the Costa Rica Banana Company during the months of July and August . At its examination of the case during its meeting of February , the Committee left pending the question of the arrest of dozens of trade union leaders, including the alleged arrest of Edwin Oviedo, General Secretary of the Union of Workers of El Golfillo. The Government replied that the authorities had never arrested citizens for the mere fact of holding trade union office. The Committee recommended the Governing Body to ask the Government to provide precise information on the reasons for the arrests mentioned by the complainant and on the present situation of the arrested trade unionists.
.In its communication of  April , the Government states that as a result of the disturbances which occurred during the banana conflict, several citizens were arrested, including workers in the banana company, trade union leaders and other individuals for having committed various offences which resulted in a breach of the peace (riot, disobedience, contempt, public incitement, etc.). The Government repeats that the trade union militants, amongst others, were not arrested because of their trade union status but because they had committed punishable acts. The Government goes on to say that all the persons arrested were quickly released and now enjoy absolute liberty pending a decision by the courts on their alleged guilt.
.As regards the trade union leader Edwin Oviedo, the Government states that he was arrested on charges of obstruction of public services, riot, disobedience and contempt; however, since there was insufficient evidence upon which to base a judgement of innocence or guilt, he has now been released and enjoys absolute liberty.
.As concerns the arrest of the trade union leader Edwin Oviedo, the Committee notes that as a result of insufficient evidence upon which to convict him of the offences with which he was charged, he has been released and now enjoys absolute liberty.
.As concerns the other leaders arrested as a result of the dispute in the banana company, the Committee notes the statement by the Government that they have been released pending an investigation by the courts of the allegation that they committed offences punishable under ordinary law.
.In theses circumstances, and since the complainant has furnished no precise information on the reasons for the arrests and the identity of the persons arrested, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further examination.

.In its communication of  August  the UISTABP alleges repression of the banana workers, the militarisation of their work, government intervention in the Union of Workers of El Golfillo (UTG) and the imprisonment of dozens of workers, including Edwin Oviedo, General Secretary of UTG.
.In its communication of  October  the Government states that at no time has it practised a policy of repression against the banana workers, that the public authorities do not even possess statutory powers to militarise any form of labour and that the Government has not intervened in UTG. As regards the arrest of trade union leaders, continues the Government, the authorities have not arrested citizens for the mere fact of holding trade union office.
.The Government states that, following talks between the representatives of UTG and the Costa Rica Banana Company on matters related to the collective agreement in force, which failed to result in an agreement on wages and the dismissal of workers, a strike was called - which was later to be declared illegal by the courts - on  July , despite the repeated efforts at conciliation by the ministry of Labour and Social Security, which remained unsuccessful even after the strike had begun. In these circumstances, continues the Government, and pursuant to the Labour Code, the Executive issued a decree on  August  to place the plantations under temporary control as they were regarded as a public service under private ownership, and to regulate the conduct of labour-management relations. The Government indicates that the strike was ended by the trade union leaders on  August, when the Ministry of Labour and Social Security replied favourably to the proposals made by trade union organisations respecting the Decree of  August . These proposals, made by Edwin Oviedo, among others, on  August , referred to the continuity of contracts of employment, the undertaking that there would be no reprisals against those who had participated in the strike, the action to be taken as regards the dismissals made before the strike began, etc.
.The Government reports that there has been full labour and social peace in the banana zone of the South Pacific area of the country since the strike ended.
.The Committee notes that the labour dispute in the Banana Company has ended and that the present labour and social situation in the zone is peaceful.
.The Committee nevertheless wishes to point out that the Government has not given a concrete reply to the allegation of the complainant regarding the arrest of trade union leaders. In this connection the Committee would like to obtain detailed information on any arrests of trade union leaders arising out of the labour dispute and on the present situation of any persons that may have been arrested, in particular on the alleged arrest of Edwin Oviedo, General Secretary of the UTG, even though the Committee has noted that the signature of Mr. Oviedo appears on the document of  August  in which the trade union organisations made proposals to the Ministry regarding the Decree of  August .
.The Committee also observes that the Government has not indicated the grounds on which the strike of  July  was declared illegal. For its part, the Committee notes that all strikes in public services are unlawful under section  of the Labour Code, and that section (b) includes in this category of, services work performed by employees engaged in the care or harvesting of agricultural products. In this respect the Committee would like to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that prohibitions on the right to strike are admissible only to the extent which they apply to civil servants or workers in essential services in the strict sense, i.e., services whose interruption would endanger the existence or well-being of the whole or part of the population. The Committee wishes to recall that the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations, in its General Survey on freedom of association and collective bargaining, mentions agriculture as not forming part of essential services in the strict sense of the term.
.In these circumstances the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adopt the present interim report and in particular the following conclusions;The Committee must draw the attention of the Government to the fact that the prohibition of strikes is admissible only to the extent which it applies to the civil service or to essential services in the strict sense.The Committee requests precise information from the Government on the reasons for the arrests mentioned by the complainants and on the present situation of the arrested trade unionists.",1,1980,Costa Rica
396,".The complaint of the General Central of Workers (CGT) of the Dominican, Republic is contained in telegrams dated ,  and  January . The Government furnished a reply by a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.It its communication the CGT alleges that the Government refuses to pay the sugar workers the bonuses due to them or accede to their demands, that it has dismissed over , workers and that it runs workplaces along military lines. The CGT also alleges that its General Secretary, Francisco Antonio Santos, has been arrested.
.The Government observes that bonuses are awarded to the employees of an undertaking when that undertaking shows a profit at the end of its financial year, and that this has not been the case with the State Sugar Board, under whose authority the state sugar workers operate, since it has suffered losses of more than  million Dominican pesos, thus it is released from its obligation to pay bonuses. The Government adds that nevertheless the State Sugar Board, under an agreement signed by the majority of the union leaders in the sugar industry, who had formed a Co-ordinating Committee for the Sugar Trade Unions, agreed to pay the workers  days' wages as an advance on future bonuses. According to the Government this agreement was violated by the employees of three of the state sugar works when they called a strike which was ruled to be illegal by the Court of Appeal of San Pedro de Maccris. As a result, the managements of the sugar works in question, exercising the powers vested in them by the Labour Code to meet such circumstances, terminated the contracts of hundreds of sugar workers. Subsequently, by order of the President of the Republic, all these workers were reinstated in their posts with the exception of a minority whose reinstatement has been left in abeyance while their cases are examined by the officials of the State Sugar Board. As concerns the arrest of Francisco Antonio Santos, the Government states that he was taken into preventive custody for the purpose of interrogation, but was released immediately by order of the President of the Republic himself, at the request of the labour authorities.
.The Committee notes the Government's observations concerning the sugar workers' dispute and the fact that the majority of the dismissed workers have been reinstated in their posts. The Committee recalls that in previous cases where it has examined allegations of dismissals arising out of strikes it has considered that such measures involve serious risks of abuse and serious threats to freedom of association. It has also expressed the view on such occasions that the development of labour relations could be impaired as the result of an inflexible attitude being adopted in the application of excessively severe sanctions to workers who participate in strike action. In view of these considerations the Committee is of the opinion that it would be particularly desirable for the Government to take steps to facilitate the reinstatement of the workers who have not been re-established in their jobs, and would like to be kept informed of the action taken to deal with their cases.
.The Committee notes the information supplied by the Government to the effect that the arrest of the trade unionist Francisco Antonio Santos was a preventive measure for the purpose of interrogation and that he was released immediately by order of the President of the Republic himself.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:",-1,1980,Dominican Republic
397,".The complaint is contained in two communications from the United Workers Trade Union Movement (MOSUO) dated  June and  July  respectively. The Government sent in its observations in a letter dated  August .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), as well as the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No.  ).
.In its communications MOSUO refers to acts of violence occurring during a drivers' strike, which began on  May and lasted for a week, to protest against what the complainant considered to be an excessive increase in the price of petrol. The complainant alleges that several trade union leaders including Hilario Henriquez and Mario Robles Fortuna, Secretary-General and Organising Secretary respectively of their trade union federation, were arrested; that the trade union headquarters were occupied by the military forces; that the suppression of the strike led to the death of three persons and the injury of  others (at least  of them by gunfire) and that the number of persons arrested exceeded ,, many of whom were brutalised by the military and police forces.
.In its reply the Government indicates that the strike was declared without undertaking any form of dialogue with the competent authorities and that it was widely exploited by anarchists and terrorist groups, who proceeded to burn vehicles, throw stones, and exchange gunfire, etc.; this resulted in the killing of one policeman and ore civilian.
.With regard to the arrests of Hilario Henriquez and Mario Robles Fortuna, the Government states that the arrests were made when the persons in question were engaged in non-union activities and that the police were at the time unaware of their trade union status. In any case they were released immediately after questioning. All those arrested have likewise been released. Furthermore, financial compensation has been granted to the workers to cover the cost of the increase in the price of petrel. The Government also asserts that the trade union headquarters were not occupied by the military forces and that the drivers went back to work.
.The Government points out that the deaths of civilians and soldiers which were reported by MOSUO occurred either during isolated actions which resulted from skirmishes between armed civilians and the forces of law and order or as a result of actions brought about by the same groups of vandals referred to above.
.The Committee notes the statement of the Government that the two trade union leaders, Hilario Henriquez and Mario Robles Fortuna, as well as all those who were arrested during the drivers' strike of May , have been released. It also notes that the drivers returned to work and received financial compensation from the Government.
.The Committee observes that the information supplied by the Government confirms the gravity of the events which took place during the above-mentioned drivers' strike, which resulted in armed skirmishes in which several persons lost their lives and others were injured. In similar cases of disturbances which have involved the loss of human lives, the Committee has emphasised that the institution by the Government concerned of an independent inquiry is a particularly appropriate method of elucidating the facts and determining responsibilities. In the present case, the Committee considers it necessary for the Government to indicate whether such an inquiry has been initiated and, if so, to inform the Committee of its results.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body:(a) to note that the trade union leaders, Hilario Henriquez and Mario Robles Fortuna, as well as all other persons arrested during the drivers' strike which began on  May, were subsequently released;(b) to deplore the seriousness of the incidents which occurred during the above-mentioned drivers' strike and to request the Government to indicate whether an inquiry has been initiated to determine responsibilities in respect of these deaths and, if so, to inform the Committee of its findings.",0,1980,Dominican Republic
398,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the General Central of Workers dated  July . The Government has replied in a communication dated  September .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The General Central of workers alleges that mass dismissals of state-employed teachers have taken place and that those affected include more than  officials and active members of the Dominican Teachers' Association.
.The Government states that the Secretariat of State for Education has not ordered mass dismissals, but that as a result of a ration-wide reorganisation of the public education system it has suspended from their duties a total of  members of the teaching staff whose files attest to their having committed serious misdemeanours in the performance of their functions.
.The Government states that it is the executive's responsibility to decide whether to terminate the contracts of employment of suspended employees after examining their files and the recommendations of the Secretary of State for Education in this connection. With this end in view, continues the Government, the suspended employees have been invited to discuss in a personal interview the accusations made in their files. As a result, some of the persons whose contracts had been suspended have already been reinstated in their posts, while the review of the remaining cases continues.
.The Committee has expressed the opinion on earlier occasions, within the context of Article  of Convention No. , ratified by the Dominican Republic, that it is not incumbent upon it to comment on the problem of breach of employment contract by dismissal, except in cases of dismissal as an act of anti-union discrimination. In this connection the Committee notes that the complainant has referred to mass dismissals of State-employed teachers, including more than  trade union officials, without furnishing any details as to the circumstances of these dismissals or specifying the names and trade union functions of the persons whose employment contracts are said to have been suspended. The Committee also notes that the Government states that there have been no mass suspensions of employment contracts, but that, under a plan for the reorganisation of the education system, the contracts of persons with a record of serious misdemeanours have been suspended. The Committee further observes that each of the cases of suspension is being reviewed individually, some of the persons concerned having already been reinstated while the review of the remaining cases is continuing.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that this case does not call for further consideration.",-1,1980,Dominican Republic
399,".The Committee already examined this case at its November  and February  Sessions, when it presented interim reports to the Governing Body.
.Since then the complainant organisations have sent the ILO the following communications: the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), communications dated  April and  June ; the Latin American Federation of Farm Workers (FCLA), a communication dated  June ; the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), communications dated  June,  June and  July  and  January ; the external co-ordination secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers (COB), communications dated  June and  July ; the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), a communication dated  July ; and the world Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), a communication dated  July .
.The Government, for its part, sent observations in letters dated  July ,  and  January,  and  February .
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints presented in this case related to repressive action taken against the trade union movement following the change of government on  July . The allegations mainly concerned the violent death of certain trade unionists, including Gualberto Vega Yapura, a leader of the Trade Union Federation of Bolivian Mineworkers, and the arrest of numerous trade union leaders and militants. The external co-ordination secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers had supplied a list of more than  persons arrested, which was transmitted to the Government for its observations. The complaints also related to the dissolution by administrative authority of the Bolivian Central of Workers and almost all the trade union organisations. Following a mission carried out on the spot by a representative of the Director-General in October , the Committee proceeded to an initial examination of the case in November . Subsequently, the Committee received additional complaints concerning the death of several trade unionists and the arrest of trade union leaders and militants.
.At its March  Session, the Governing Body, on the Committee's recommendation, expressed its concern at the gravity of the allegations which continued to be brought to its knowledge. It recalled that a free and independent trade union movement can only develop where fundamental human rights are respected. Concerning the specific allegations of the complainants, the Governing Body requested the Government to continue its investigation into the death of Gualberto Vega and to supply information on the circumstances surrounding the death of certain trade union leaders, including Artemio Amargo, on  January . The Governing Body also requested the Government to supply as precise information as possible on the fate of Gregorio Andrade, a peasant leader, Walter Delgadillo, a leader of the COB, Pablo Copa, a leader of the Federation of Miners, and Gloria Ardaya, alleged to have been arrested in January . Lastly, as regards the revision of the trade union legislation, the Governing Body requested the Government to continue to keep it informed of the progress made in this connection, and expressed the firm hope that the legislation so amended would be in full conformity with the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , ratified by Bolivia, and would lead rapidly to the restoration of freedom of association in the country.
.In its communication of  April , the WCL supplies particulars about the circumstances in which Gregorio Andrade, a peasant leader and member of the COB executive Committee, was arrested on  January  after his arrest, he is said to have been held in the Political Department prison in La Paz and to have disappeared after  March . The WCL also refers to the disappearance, since  July , of Ren Sanchez, secretary of the Federation of Industrial Workers of La Paz lastly, the WCL states that numerous workers were arrested following trade union reactions to the economic measures adopted by the Government in mid-January , including the trade union leader, Bernab Quiroz, who was killed and whose corpse was handed over to his family by the army.
.The communications sent by the complainant organisations in June and July  concern the arrest of Genaro Flores, secretary-general of the COB for farm workers and general co-ordinator of the COB underground. According to the complainants, Genaro Flores belonged to a group of  trade union leaders who were attacked on  June  by paramilitary groups and then arrested. Seriously wounded by bullets in the spine, Genaro Flores was transported to the police hospital in La Paz. Fearing that his life was in danger, the complainant organisation requested the Director-General to intervene so that. Mr. Flores would be allowed to leave Bolivia for a country where he could receive care.
.Lastly, the external co-ordination secretariat of the COB alleges that Marcelo Quezada, a journalist of the COB magazine, was arrested in La Paz on  June .
.Regarding the death of the trade union leaders, Gualberto Vega and Artemio Camargo, the Government regrets to confirm in its communication of  January  that these two persons died, on  July  and  January , respectively.
.The Government also states that Pablo Copa, Walter Delgadillo and Gloria Ardaya have gone into exile in different countries of Europe.
.As regards the position of Genaro Flores, the Government, after pointing out in its letter of  July  that this trade union leader had been wounded by the police when attempting to escape and was receiving proper care, states in, its communication of  January  that he is now in exile in Europe.
.Regarding the trade union situation in general, in its letter of  January  the Government states that it concluded an agreement with the mineworkers' representatives on  December , with the Catholic church acting as mediator, as part of the efforts being made to bring about, through dialogue, a gradual return to normal trade union activities by sectors. The Government supplies the text of the agreement in question along with its communication of  February .
.The Bolivian workers' right of association is fully recognised under that, agreement. Consequently, like the mineworkers, and immediately after hem, other workers will re-establish their trade union organisations according to a sectoral timetable fixed by the Ministry of Labour.
.The mineworkers will set up their trade unions and federations within  and  days, respectively, from the date of the agreement. The National Directorate of Bolivian workers will be re-established within  days when all of the sector have organised their federations and Confederations.
.Pending the implementation of his timetable, the workers will be represented in their relations with the employers by plant Committees democratically elected in each sector of activity. In this connection the Government has adopted Resolution No. / dated  January  which sets out the organisation of the elections, prescribes that there will only be one plant Committee per undertaking and that candidates for these Committees shall fulfil certain conditions, in particular, to be born in Bolivia, to have worked at least one year in the undertaking concerned and not to have been convicted of any criminal charge. In addition, negotiations on, wages and the reopening of broadcasting stations will be resumed with the workers' representatives starting on  January . Lastly, the Government will issue rules for the elections to plant Committees according to a timetable established in the agreement of  December . Decree No.  to dissolve trade union leadership and Decree No.  to appoint ""labour relations officers"" have also been repealed.
.In, its communication of  February , the Government states that the workers are presently standing for election to the plant Committees in an atmosphere of freedom. To this moment  of these Committees have been recognised.
.The Committee takes note of the general development of the trade union situation in Bolivia. It must however note with regret that the Government has replied only partially to the allegations made by the complainants about specific events.
.The Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information about the circumstances surrounding the death of Gualberto Vega and Artemio Camargo or replied to the allegations concerning the death of eight trade union leaders who, like Artemio Camargo, are said to have been shot down in La Paz on  January . In these circumstances, the Committee can only deplore the violent deaths of these trade unionists. It must recall the importance in such cases of carrying out at once an impartial and full inquiry to clarify the facts and determine responsibilities. The atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue, which the Government states it wishes to restore, may be created more easily once the responsibilities of officials concerned have been established and the persons who have abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.
.Regarding the four trade unionists alleged to have been arrested in January , the Committee notes that three of them have been forced into exile in this connection, the Committee tresses that the forcing",0,1980,Bolivia (Plurinational State of

401,".The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Federation of workers in the Service of the State (FENALTRASE-CITE) and the National Union of National Public Works Employees (SINDEOPNALES) of  June . The Government replied by a communication of  February .
.Colombia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainants allege that the members of the trade union organisation of the National Transport Institute (INTRA) have been persecuted as trade unionists, that they have been threatened with loss of membership, that over  workers have been dismissed, and finally that the members of the basic trade union executive, Victor Quintero Dueas, Gabriela Castrilln Restrepo, Gustavo Orejarena Acevedo, Alfonso Morales Caicedo and Humberto Correa Amaya, have been dismissed en bloc.
.The Government sends a communication from the Director General of the National Transport Institute (INTRA) in reply to a request for information, and the text of the resolution of  May  denying legal personality to the ""Union of Workers of the National Transport Institute"", essentially because the rules of the organisation conferred upon the general assembly a series of powers (""adoption of statements of claims, election of bargaining agents, conciliators and arbitrators, calling of strikes"") which were contrary to the provisions of the legislation.
.In his reply the Director-General of INTRA states that he has received no notification of the existence of any legally recognised trade union in the Institute, from which he infers that there is no trade union persecution.
.The Director-General of INTRA also remarks that public employees do not enjoy the right to present statements of claims, conclude collective labour agreements or promote disputes of interests, that Decrees Nos.  of  and  of  permit the free appointment and removal from office of public employees and that these powers have not been used against former officials merely because they had formed an association, but because, in order to carry out its work effectively, INTRA must be free to select employees and subordinate staff who are loyal to the moral principles governing this administration, principles which have at no time been held by the said officials, as is obvious from the posters that they have affixed in public places.
.The Committee takes note of the Government's statements that there is no legally recognised trade union in INTRA, and that public employees do not enjoy the right to conclude collective agreements or promote disputes of interests. The Committee also notes that by resolution of  May  the Union of Workers of INTRA was refused legal personality because the rules of the organisation went beyond the limits imposed by the legislation governing public employees as regards collective bargaining and disputes of interests.
.In this respect the Committee must draw the Government's attention to the fact that Convention No.  applies to all workers, including public officials, and that the scope of Convention No. , although it does not extend to public officials in the state administration, nevertheless covers all persons employed by the State or in the public sector who do not act as instruments of public authority, including public employees in the transport sector. Consequently, the Committee draws the attention of the Government to the necessity of changing the legislation so as to allow public employees in the transport sector to benefit fully from the guarantees provided for by Conventions Nos.  and , in particular the right of their trade union organisations, as is the case for all other workers' organisations, to organise their activities and formulate their programmes and to bargain collectively.
.As regards the dismissals of more than  workers and the members of the executive of the Union of Workers of INTRA (Victor Quintero Dueas, Gabriela Castrilln Restrepo, Gustavo Orejarena Acevedo, Alfonso Morales Caicedo and Humberto Correa Amaya), the Committee observes that neither the complainant (which referred to trade union persecution) nor the Government (which stated that the persons who were dismissed did not hold the moral principles obtaining in INTRA, as was obvious from the posters that they had affixed in public places) specified the reasons for the dismissals in sufficient detail. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that the Union of Workers of INTRA was unable to obtain legal personality because its rules were not in conformity with certain provisions which excessively limit the trade union rights of public employees and that this resulted in the present case in their leaders being denied the protection granted by legislation to trade union leaders, the Committee feels that it would be useful, for the harmonious development of labour relations, for the Government to reconsider the position of the above-mentioned leaders with a view to reinstating them in their employment, in so far as their dismissals were not based on grounds other than the promotion and defence of the workers' interests.",0,1980,Colombia

At its March  Session the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, asked the Government for its observations on the complainant's allegations and, in particular, to send it the results of the current administrative inquiry into these dismissals, especially those of the trade union leaders Luis Efrn Loaiza and Miguel Zea.
.In its reply of  December , the Government states that the trade union leaders in question, after lodging an appeal with the courts, have been reinstated in their jobs. It goes on to state, regarding the allegation of mass dismissals at the firm, that the official in charge of the inquiry into the matter has informed the head of the Department of Labour and Social Security of Antioquiz that such mass dismissals did not take place. The document communicated by the Government indicates that of the , workers at the firm,  were dismissed and paid compensation between January and December . This staff turnover, the Government concludes, took place gradually and at intervals over a period of eight months and may be regarded as normal for a firm of this size.
.Regarding the dismissal of the two trade union leaders, the Committee notes that they have been reinstated in the firm after appealing to the courts. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.Regarding the allegation of mass dismissals of workers at the firm ""Productos Noel"", S.A., the Committee notes that, according to the inquiry carried out by the competent authorities, the staff turnover which took place during  may be regarded as normal and that the dismissed workers have been paid compensation.

.The complainant adds that the undertaking ""Frigorifico Suizo"", S.A., of Bogot has resorted to all kinds of measures - offers of loans, threats, dismissals, etc. - to destroy the trade union of the undertaking.
.Lastly, the complainant states that the major demands of the workers remained unsatisfied in the negotiation of the claims of the workers of the undertaking ""Gaseosas del Tolima"", S.A. (Tolima), ""Gaseosas del Huila"", S.A. (Neiva) and ""Cervecera Andina"".
.In its communication of  January  the Government states that the trade union of the undertaking ""Productos Noel"", S.A., of Medellin, requested an administrative inquiry into the collective dismissals alleged by the complainant; this was ordered immediately by the labour authorities in order to clarify the case and is not yet completed.
.As regards the allegation relating to the purported persecution of the trade union in the undertaking ""Frigorifico Suizo"", S.A., the Government states that the Labour Inspectorate examined four petitions by the trade union of the undertaking relating to this ""trade union persecution"", and that having made investigations and heard the parties it issued a resolution exonerating the undertaking from the accusations made by the trade union, without the latter seeking any of the means of redress provided for by the law.
.Lastly, says the Government, the undertakings ""Gaseosas del Tolima"", S.A., ""Gaseosas del Huila"", S.A., and ""Cervecera: Andina"" concluded collective agreements on  September,  September and  October , respectively.

.As regards the attempts by the employer to destroy the union of the undertaking ""Frigorfico Suizo"", S.A., the Committee notes that this union presented four petitions which were examined by the Labour Inspectorate, and that a resolution on the latter exonerated the undertaking from the accusations made without any appeal having been lodged against it.
.As regards the absence of a response by the undertakings ""Gaseosas del Tolima"", S.A., ""Gaseosas del Huila"", S.A., and ""Cervecera Andina"" to the demands of the workers, the Committee notes that collective agreements were concluded in these undertakings shortly after the presentation of the complaint. The Committee accordingly considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.

.Further allegations
.The complainants allege that Israel Neftal Mrquez, General Secretary of the EGSA workers' union, was forced to leave the country in March  after numerous attempts were made to kill him. Miguel Cifuentes, General Secretary of the Tacasa tobacco workers' union was forced to leave for the same reason in April .
.The complainants further allege that by the end of September  the largest central trade union body in the country, the CNT, had lost  of its  affiliated trade unions as a result of the methods used by the Government and the employers to destroy the trade unions: the adjournment of legal recognition of the unions for months or even years; occupation by the armed forces of factories, the employers being able to hire soldiers; the creation of (""amarillos"") trade unions dominated by factory owners; the artificial closure of factories later opened again under different names, with new staff and without a trade union, and finally, the use of intimidation.
.On  January , at midnight, according to the complainants, the police were summoned by the management to the EGSA factory, where they threatened to arrest the entire night shift consisting of  to  workers owing to the smashing of an old piece of equipment, which the management were hasty to term ""worker sabotage"".
.The complainants further allege that in the month of April  the management of EGSA dismissed  workers, including three trade union leaders, after the workers' union had appealed to the courts for a ruling ordering the continuation of negotiations for the renewal of a collective agreement which they had already obtained. Despite a ruling by the labour court for the reinstatement of all the dismissed workers, only the three trade union officials have been reinstated. Four of the  workers dismissed have agreed, under death threats, to accept their dismissal.
.With reference to the events of  April , when  armed men entered the CNT premises and arrested  trade unionists, the complainants state that the premises were destroyed and that their typewriters, copying machines and other office equipment were confiscated, and that the telephone line was cut.
.Finally, in a communication dated  March , the ICFTU alleges that a Draft Labour Code submitted to the Congress of the Republic of Guatemala by the Ministry of Labour and Social welfare and due, in principle, to come into force on  May , contained several provisions which are not in conformity with Convention No.  (Case No. ).",-1,1980,Guatemala

In a communication dated  October  UITA states that more than  people disappear daily in Guatemala. Many of them are trade union leaders or persons involved in the labour movement. The complainants refer in particular to the disappearance on  June  of Manuel Jess Garcia, a member of the EGSA workers' union.
.Cases of physical assault
.The complainants allege the following cases of physical assault:- on  February  Pablo Bautista was seriously wounded by machine-gun fire from armed civilians.

.Arrests
.The complainants allege that shortly after the murder of the EGSA trade union leader Pedro Quevedo on  December ,  workers were placed in gaol on false charges. They add that on  April  Yolanda Urizar Martinez de Aguilar and Rosa Maria Wantlan Garcia, lawyers working for the trade union movement and advisers to the CNT, were arrested at Guatemala City airport together with a secretary working for the CNT. On  December  Alfredo Briones, Willy Mijangos and Carlos Gmez, militant members of the CNT, were also arrested.

.The complainants further allege that on  June , after the murders of Edgar Ren Aldama and Oscar Amilcar Tatuaca, the CNT Executive Committee met delegates of the trade unions concerned at the headquarters of the CNT to discuss what action should be taken and to discuss a possible demonstration to protest against the murders. During the discussion a group of  heavily armed men, claiming to be members of the state security forces, blocked traffic in the street of Guatemala City next to the CNT headquarters, broke down the door with a jeep, broke up the meeting and arrested  trade unionists, who were led in small groups to unknown destinations.

He also asked the President to communicate any information on the measures that might be taken as regards this serious situation.
.No reply has been received to the communication sent to the President of the Republic of Guatemala by the Director-General.
.At its meeting in November , the Committee observed that in spite of the time which had elapsed, the observations of the Government on Case No.  had not been received and requested it to send them urgently.
.At its meeting in February , the Committee noted with regret that it had still not received the Government's observations regarding Cases Nos. , , ,  and  in view of the extremely serious nature of the allegations the Committee again requested the Government to reply urgently.
.At its May  meeting the Committee noted that, despite repeated requests, the Government had sent no reply. The Committee therefore decided to apply to Cases Nos. , , ,  and  the procedure contained in the Committee's th Report according to which the Chairman of the Committee would make contact with the Government's representatives in order to have an exchange of views on the cases in question.
.In accordance with the Committee's decision, the Chairman met with the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare and the Permanent Representative Ambassador of Guatemala in Geneva on  June . The Chairman referred to the persistent failure of the Government of Guatemala to reply to all the communications concerning the cases before the Committee which had been sent to it during the previous year, in particular the letter sent personally by the Director-General of the ILO to the President of the Republic of Guatemala on  August .
.The Chairman of the Committee added that the failure to reply was particularly serious in view of the fact, that four of the five cases involved the death or arrest of trade union leaders.
.The Minister expressed his surprise that the President of the Republic had not replied to the Director-General's letter, and stated that he would do all he could be obtain a reply.
.The Minister also stated that he would do everything possible to reply in writing before returning to Guatemala. To make this task easier a copy of the Director-General's letter was delivered to him on  June, together with copies of all the relevant communications which had been sent concerning Cases nos. , , ,  and .
.Apart from a brief communication dated  June  concerning one aspect of Case No. , which was examined by the Committee at its meeting in May  when it presented an interim report on this case, the Government has not sent any observations on the cases in question.
.In view of the seriousness of the allegations, and in view of the time which has elapsed since the complaints were communicated to the Government, the Committee proposes, in accordance with the procedural rule set out in paragraph  of its th Report, to present a report on the substance of each case in question.
.Guatemala has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.As stated above, the Committee examined Case No.  at its meeting in May  and presented an interim report.
.CPUSTAL had alleged that Rodolfo Ramirez, General Secretary of the Autonomous Trade Union. Federation of Guatemala (FASGUA) and his wife were murdered on  April , together with Maximo Velsquez Melgar, Secretary of the Trade Union of the Hemp Sack Factory, who was treacherously murdered as he was leaving work on  March . CPUSTAL added that on  May  the bodies of Ricardo Garcia and Arnulfo Gmez, leaders of the Coca-Cola Workers' Union who had been kidnapped on  May, were found. The complainant also referred to the kidnapping, death and subsequent discovery of the corpses of peasants and workers, some of whom it mentioned by name, and to the murder of  workers on  May, among whom were Judith Gonzlez, Edgar Gonzlez Garcia and Manuel de Jess Flores.
.CPUSTAL also alleged that Guillermo Hernndez - Secretary of the Union of Central American Sanitation Workers (INCESA) -, Hugo Rolando Tello Gonzlez and Guillermo Hernndez Gmez - trade union leaders whose whereabouts are unknown - and Efraim Njera and Margarito Tzul - both workers - were all under arrest.
.The complainant added that on  April  the army brutally repressed the meeting of Coca-Cola workers who were discussing a problem of wages. Twenty-seven workers subsequently disappeared, although the Government denied that they were under arrest. Furthermore, according to CPUSTAL on  April  a group of  armed persons attacked, sacked and destroyed the premises of the CNT in Guatemala City, abducting  workers and beating up the watchman of the premises, Miguel Angel Olayo.
.CPUSTAL also alleged that a large number of written threats were received by  major trade union leaders, warning them to leave the country within  days, and stating that they would be killed if they did not do so.
.Finally, the complainant stated that on  March  the headquarters of the FASGUA trade union organisation in Escuintla was attacked with machine-gun fire.
.In a communication dated  June  the Government stated that on the day when the General Secretary of FASGUA was murdered by persons unknown, the Government issued precise instructions to the Detective Section of the National Police to investigate the case. The Government added that no information had been discovered concerning the deaths of the General Secretary and his wife, as the assassins had left no traces, but the police were continuing with their inquiries.
.The Committee keenly regretted that, despite repeated requests, the Government had not replied in detail to the allegations of the complainant, and that it therefore had been obliged to examine the case without having received detailed observations from the Government.
.The Committee deeply deplored the deaths and murders of trade union leaders and workers, and expressed its concern at the seriousness of the allegations.
.The Committee drew the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement could develop only under a regime which guarantees fundamental human rights and requested the Government, in view of the deaths which had occurred and the seriousness of the allegations, to adopt a policy for the taking of special measures to fully guarantee the rights to personal safety, protection against unjustified arrest and detention, the right of assembly and demonstration, and the protection of trade union premises and property.
.The Committee requested the Government to send its observations on the allegations made, in particular as to the death of the trade unionists mentioned in the complaint and as to the present situation of arrested workers and trade union leaders.
.Deaths, murders and disappearances
.The complainants refer to the following deaths:- Pedro Quevedo, Financial Secretary of the Guatemalan Bottling Company Workers' Union (EGSA), murdered on  December ;- Manuel Francisco Lpez Baln, General Secretary of the EGSA Workers' Union, murdered on  April ;- Miguel Archilla, trade union leader, killed by the police on  October  shortly after a demonstration by agricultural workers protesting against the dismissal of workers from the ISOTAL estate, which was violently dispersed;- Jos Len Castaeda, General Secretary of the Communication Workers' Union (SIMCOS), who was abducted on  November  and died under torture the following day;- Ricardo de Jess Monzon Noriega, a trade union leader of the El Salto SA sugar factory, murdered on  February  while returning from work;- Julio Villavicencio Morales, disputes secretary of a Puerto Barrios trade union, who died from bullet wounds received on  March  after leaving a trade union meeting;- Arnulfo Feliciano Lpez Velzquez, financial secretary of the Capri textile factory workers' union. His body was discovered on  April ; he had been shot. He had been kidnapped the same day as he was leaving the factory at midday;- Horacio Samayoa Mayen, General Secretary of the Regional Autonomous Federation of the South, who, with his son Ernesto, died from bullet wounds received as they entered a bar in Mazatenango on  April ;- Claudio Roberto Mamirez, an FNT official, found dead with bullet wounds on  April . His body also showed signs of torture. He had been kidnapped by detectives belonging to the national police;- Ren Reyes, member of the EGSA trade union, murdered on  May . The complainants state that on  May the bodies of  unidentified persons were found at the morgue in Guatemala City. They had been killed by machine-gun fire from persons unknown when the  May demonstration was dispersed;- Gabriel Claveria Aldana, a worker at the Hemp Sack factory, who apparently took part in the demonstration on  May .",0,1980,Guatemala
407,".The Committee examined Cases NOS. , , ,  and  at its November  Session.
.In view of the extremely serious nature of the allegations made in this case and the persistent failure of the Government to reply, despite the Committee's numerous requests and urgent appeals, the urgent appeal from the Director-General on  August  to the President of the Republic of Guatemala and the appeal made by the Chairman of the Committee when he met the Government representatives during the last session of the International Labour Conference, the Committee, in accordance with the procedure in force, submitted an interim report on the substance of the case although it had not received any observations from the Government.
.In stating its conclusions and recommendations, the Committee regretted the Government's failure to reply and expressed its deep concern at the seriousness of the allegations, including murders and violent physical attacks on a large number of trade union leaders, trade unionists and workers, arrests and disappearances of persons belonging to the trade union movement, threats, violations of the right to strike, violent interference in trade union meetings, the occupation of trade union premises, attacks on trade union property and dismissals for trade union activities.
.Consequently, the Committee recommended that the Governing Body decide to give to its report the widest possible distribution.
.That recommendation was given effect by sending the Committee's report to all the Governments of States Members of the International Labour Organisation.
.The Committee regrets that, since it submitted its report to the November  Session, the Government has chosen to ignore the Committee's recommendations that it send observations. Accordingly, the Committee can only reiterate the conclusions and recommendations - approved by the Governing Body - that it reached at its November  Sessions and again recommends that the Governing Body decide to give to this report the widest possible distribution.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee keenly regrets that the Government has not sent its observations, despite requests and urgent appeals by the Committee, the urgent appeal of the Director-General and the appeal made by the Chairman of the Committee during the last International Labour Conference. The Committee also regrets that the Government has chosen to ignore the recommendations it made at its November  Session - approved by the Governing Body at the same session - that observations should be sent.The Committee considers it useful again to remind the Government that the purpose of the procedure for the examination of complaints submitted to the Committee is to promote respect for trade union rights, both de jure and de facto, and that whereas the procedure protects governments against unreasonable accusations, the governments in turn must recognise the importance of sending detailed replies to the allegations so that an objective appraisal can be made. In this connection the Committee considers that the co-operation of governments in elucidating the questions referred to the Committee by the complainants is essential for promoting full respect for trade union rights and the normal development of the trade union movement.The Committee is extremely concerned at the seriousness of the allegations: murders, violent physical attacks on a large number of trade union leaders, trade unionists and workers, arrests and disappearances of persons linked to the trade union movement, threats, violations of the right to strike, violent interference in trade union meetings, the occupation of trade union premises and dismissals for trade union activities.The Committee considers it necessary again to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can only develop under a regime which respects and guarantees fundamental human rights. The Committee therefore requests the Government to adopt a policy providing for special measures to fully guarantee the right to personal security, adequate protection against unjustified arrest and detention, the right of assembly and demonstration for trade union purposes, and the protection of trade union premises and property.The Committee deeply deplores the numerous losses of human life and the injuries and ill-treatment suffered by those mentioned in the complaints. The Committee draws the attention of the Government to the importance of a prompt and independent investigation of the alleged cases of death, assault and ill-treatment, with a view to elucidating the facts in full, identifying the persons responsible and instituting proceedings against them. The Committee requests the Government to inform it of the outcome of these investigations.The Committee suggests that the Government be asked to inquire into the whereabouts and condition of the persons who have disappeared and to keep it informed of developments in this respect.The Committee recalls that governments should ensure that any person arrested is treated in accordance with the normal procedures and that his case is dealt with promptly, and points out that the arrest of trade unionists against whom no subsequent grounds for conviction are found is liable to involve restrictions of trade union rights and may constitute serious interference in trade union activities.The Committee proposes that the Government be asked to take measures to secure the release of all those arrested owing to their membership of a trade union or involvement in trade union activities generally considered legitimate, and requests it to state the reasons for and circumstances of each arrest mentioned by the complainants, and also to report on the present condition of the persons arrested.The Committee requests the Committee of Experts on the Application of Conventions and Recommendations to continue to pay special attention to the changes required in Guatemalan legislation concerning freedom of association.The Committee wishes that the attention of the Government be drawn to the fact that, in accordance with Article  of Convention No. , workers' and employers' organisations should enjoy adequate protection against any interference in each other's activities.The Committee also recalls that Article  of Convention No.  provides that workers must enjoy adequate protection against any acts calculated to cause their dismissal by reason of their union membership or their participation in trade union activities. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take measures to ensure that the court decision ordering the reinstatement of the  EGSA workers dismissed in April  is enforced, and to report to the Committee on the matter.
.Lastly, the Committee recommends that the Governing Body again decide to give to this report the widest possible distribution.Geneva,  February . (Signed) Roberto AGO, Chairman.
.During  and  complaints regarding violations of freedom of association in Guatemala (Cases Nos. , , ,  and ) have been submitted by the following organisations: The International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), The World Confederation of Labour (WCL), The Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Latin American Workers (CPUSTAL), The International Union of Food and Allied Industries Workers (IUA) and the International Federation of Commercial, Clerical, Professional and Technical Employees (FIET).
.These complaints involve allegations of murder, detention and torture of trade union leaders and trade unionists, their disappearance, threats made against them, and attacks on trade union premises and property by the armed forces. The complaints were transmitted to the Government of Guatemala as they were received.
.Owing to the lack of observations from the Government, the Committee adjourned consideration of Case No.  at its meeting in May , of Cases Nos.  and  at its meeting in November , and of Case No.  at its meeting in February .
.The Committee noted at its May  meeting that the observations regarding Case No. , which the Committee requested from the Government at its meeting in May , had not yet been received. It therefore decided to make use of the procedure in force and presented an interim report on the substance of the case.
.In a communication dated  August  the Director General sent an urgent appeal to the President of the Republic of Guatemala. In this communication he voiced the growing concern on the part of the International Labour Organisation over the trade union situation in Guatemala, observing that the Committee on Freedom of Association and the Governing Body were currently examining several complaints of alleged violations of the freedom of association submitted by a number of international workers' organisations. The Director-General continued that in this connection the Chairman of the Committee on Freedom of Association had met the Minister of Labour and Social Welfare and the Permanent Representative Ambassador of Guatemala during the th International Labour Conference in Geneva in June , and had informed them that the Government needed to reply in detail to the Committee's requests for information.
.The Director-General also stated in his appeal that during this same period (June ) he had received telegrams from several international trade union bodies which referred to alleged violations of the freedom of association in Guatemala. In view of the seriousness and urgency of the events referred to in the telegrams, he requested the Minister for External Relations to supply him with the Government's observations as soon as possible.
.The Director-General's appeal concluded by kindly requesting the President of the",0,1980,Guatemala

.The Government subsequently submitted its observations in a communication dated  March .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.When the case was examined by the Committee at its meeting in November , the allegation concerning the dismissal of Mr. Jess Fernndez, press and propaganda officer of the National Trade Union of Telephonic Workers (SNTT), remained pending.
.The complainant had alleged that the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL), in violation of the provisions on trade union immunity, dismissed Jess Fernndez on  November  for having ""discredited"" the company. The Government replied that, according to CODETEL, Jess Fernndez was dismissed for statements which he had made to the press claiming that the company was electronically recording users' calls and for having used insulting language against various of the company's managers in violation of the Labour Code. This allegation had been denied by the union and the case was before the courts to determine whether or not the dismissal was justified. In view of the conflicting versions of events contained in the allegations and in the Government's reply, the Committee requested the latter to send it the text of the judgement handed down.
.In its communication dated  March  the Government states that the proceedings brought by Jess Fernndez against CODETEL for unjustified dismissal were dropped. The Government adds that the company and the person concerned reached a settlement under which, inter alia, the latter was paid the relevant benefits under the labour law.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement concerning the allegation of dismissal of Jess Fernndez, press and propaganda official of the SNTT. The Committee notes that CODETEL and Jess Fernndez have been able to reach a settlement under which, inter alia, the latter was-paid the relevant benefits under the labour law. In view of the fact that the parties have reached a settlement the Committee considers that the allegations made on this aspect of the case do not call for further examination.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to decide that the case does not call for further examination.
.The complaint is contained in a communication from the National Trade Union of Telephonic Workers (SNTT) dated  November . The Government replied in a communication dated  February .
.At its May  Session, the Committee decided to transmit the main points of the Government's reply to the complainant for its comments. The SNTT supplied its comments in a communication dated  July , which was forwarded to the Government. The Government sent its observations in a communication dated  October .
.The Dominican Republic has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The SNTT alleges that on  October , on the eve of negotiating a new collective agreement between the Dominican Telephone Company (CODETEL) and the SNTT, the company published a statement in the press to the effect that action would be taken against a small group of persons illegally using telephone equipment for long-distance calls. The complainant adds that the denunciation contained an indirect allusion to the workers dismissed on  October and that the purpose behind the company's action was to refuse to discuss the new collective agreement and to create circumstances propitious for breaking up the union.
.The complainant also adds that on  November , when union members had gathered to hear their leaders' reports on the negotiations for reinstating the dismissed workers, the police appeared and without warning assaulted the workers, beating . The police also arrested  workers, including various trade union officers. One of them, Jests Fernndez, the union's press and propaganda officer, was, in violation of the provisions on trade union immunity, dismissed on  November  for having ""discredited"" the company.
.Lastly, the complainant states that the company has no intention of continuing to pay union leaves and wishes to compel the union to sign new terms much inferior to those contained in previous collective agreements.
.The Government states that, according to the company, Mr. Jess Fernndez was dismissed for statements he had made to the press claiming that CODETEL was electronically recording users' calls and for having used insulting language against various of the company's managers in violation of the Labour Code. This allegation has been denied by the union and the case is before the courts to determine whether or not the dismissal was justified.
.Regarding the dismissal of other workers for reasons of service, the Government states that, according to the Department of Traffic, the persons dismissed were involved in illegal traffic of long-distance calls, an allegation which has also been denied by the union.
.Concerning the alleged assaults by the National Police, the Government states that it has no precise information on such events and that the intervention of the police was preventive action intended to maintain public order. The Government had succeeded in advancing the negotiations for concluding a new collective agreement prior to the date provided for in the existing agreement and for reinstating a number of the dismissed workers, as the company had been requested to do by the union, and the police, without disregarding the principles established by the Constitution, proceeded to disperse the pickets only in order to prevent unfortunate clashes. The Government adds that no person is being held in custody in connection with this case.
.In its last communication, the Government states that CODETEL and the SNTT have already approved most of the provisions of the new collective agreement, including a clause providing for unpaid full-time leave for two to three years for trade union leaders to allow them to attend to union business.
.The Committee notes that on  October  the company CODETEL published a statement in the press to the effect that action would be taken against a group of workers for illegally using telephone equipment for long-distance calls and that on the same day it dismissed various workers. The Committee considers, however, that the complainant, by mentioning such facts without giving further particulars, has failed to bring out any relation between those facts and the aims allegedly pursued by the company (to refuse to discuss the collective agreement and create circumstances propitious for breaking up the union), especially as the dismissed workers, according to the Department of Traffic, were involved in illegal traffic of long-distance calls. In these circumstances, the Committee considers that this aspect of the case does not call for further examination.
.In connection with the dismissal of the trade union leader Jests Fernndez, the Committee notes that a case is pending before the courts to determine whether the dismissal was justified or not. In view of the contradiction between the complainant's allegations and the Government's reply on this matter, the Committee requests the Government to send it the text of the judgement handed down in this respect so that it can examine this allegation in full knowledge of the facts.
.With respect to the allegation concerning police intervention during the trade union meeting held on  November  for purposes of information, which allegedly resulted in the beating of  persons and the arrest of , including various union leaders, the Committee notes that the Government, while not expressly denying that persons were beaten or arrested, has stated that no one is being held in custody in connection with this case, that it has no precise information on the assaults, that the police intervention was preventive action, and that the police dispersed the pickets in order to avoid unfortunate clashes.
.In view of the fact that the complainant's and the Government's versions of the circumstances surrounding the police intervention differ and that the information available is insufficient to determine with certitude whether that intervention was warranted by a real danger to public order and not merely a hypothetical one, the Committee can only recall that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which would restrict this right or impede its exercise, unless public order is disturbed thereby or its maintenance seriously and imminently endangered.
.Lastly, the Committee notes that CODETEL and the SNTT have already approved most of the provisions of the new collective agreement, including a clause providing for unpaid full-time union leave for the union's leaders.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:The Committee recalls that freedom from government interference in the holding and proceedings of trade union meetings constitutes an essential element of trade union rights and that the public authorities should refrain from any interference which may restrict this right or impede its exercise, unless public order is disturbed thereby or its",0,1980,Dominican Republic
409,"of trade unionists into exile, although a lass severe measure than detention, deprives them of the possibility of working in their country and joining their families. It is also an infringement of freedom of association in that it weakens the trade union movement by depriving it of its leaders. Moreover, normal trade union activities in the country can only be said to be fully restored when the trade union leaders now exiled are able, after returning to Bolivia, to stand again for trade union elections and perform the offices to which they may be elected.
.The Government has not supplied information about the fourth trade union leader, Gregorio Andrade, alleged to have been arrested in January  and reported to be missing since March . Non has it replied to the further allegations made by the complainants concerning the arrest of Marcelo Quezada, COB journalist, the disappearance of Perz Sanchez, secretary of the Federation of Industrial workers of La Paz, and the death of Bernab Quiroz, a trade union leader.
.Concerning the situation of Genaro Flores, a COB leader, the Committee has been informed of the approaches which the Director-General made to the Government in order that Mr. Flores could receive care abroad. The Committee notes that Mr. Flores was able to leave Bolivia for Europe where he is now living in exile.
.Regarding the trade union situation in general, the Committee notes that under an agreement concluded with the mineworkers' representatives a timetable has been established for a return to normal trade union activities. It also notes that the Government will organise plant Committee elections, thus putting an end to the functions of the ""labour relations officers"" introduced in August  to represent the workers. However, the Committee observes that the ministerial resolution relating to these plant Committees contains several regulations which are contrary to the principles of freedom of association, in particular the obligation of only one Committee per undertaking and the various conditions of eligibility. Finally the Committee notes that Decrees Nos.  and , on which comments had been made, have been repealed.
.The Committee expresses the hope that the agreement will lay the necessary groundwork for a return to normal trade union activities on the basis of legislation and practice consistent with Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Bolivia. The Committee also considers it would be useful if the Government would submit the draft of any new legislation prepared by it to the ILO for comments, as has been done in several other cases and as the Government stated its intention of doing during the direct contacts.
.The Committee would like to be kept informed of developments in the situation, in particular the implementation of the agreement concluded with the mineworkers' representatives as it bears on the establishment of local trade unions and federations and Confederations. The Committee would also like to obtain clarifications about the scope of that agreement, in particular the possibility available to workers of organising a national Confederation of their own choosing.
.In these circumstances, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to approve this interim report, in particular the following conclusions:(a) Regarding the violent death of trade union leaders, the Committee deeply regrets that the Government has not supplied specific information about the circumstances in which those deaths took place. It considers that the atmosphere of confidence essential for social dialogue may be created more easily when the responsibilities of officials concerned have been established and the persons who abused their powers have been dealt with according to law.(b) Regarding the trade unionists arrested in January , the Committee notes that three of them have been forced into exile. It stresses that forced exile not only deprives the persons concerned of the possibility of working in their country and joining their families but constitutes an infringement of freedom of association in that it weakens the trade union movement by depriving it of its leaders. The Committee considers that the trade union leaders now exiled should be able to return to Bolivia and to perform the trade union offices to which they may be elected.(c) Regarding the further allegations made by the complainants, the Committee requests the Government for its observations on the disappearance of Gregorio Andrade and Ren Sanchez, the death of Bernab Quiroz and the arrest of Marcelo Quezada.(d) Regarding the restoration of normal trade union activities, the Committee notes that Legislative Decrees Nos.  and  to deprive trade union leadership of their office and introduce labour relations officers have been repealed. It expresses the hope that the agreement concluded between the Government and the mineworkers' representatives will lay the necessary groundwork for a return to normal trade union activities on the basis of legislation and practice consistent with Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Bolivia. It suggests that the Government, according to its stated intention expressed during the direct contacts, should submit to the ILO any bills that may be prepared, far comments. The Committee requests the Government to supply information about the implementation and scope of the agreement (establishment of trade union organisations and the possibility of establishing a national Confederation of labour)
.The Committee already examined this case at its session of November  when it presented an interim report to the Governing Body. Since that meeting or shortly before, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU), the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the Miners' International Trade Union Federation (MITUF), the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), and the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL) presented additional allegations in communications dated  October and  November  and , ,  and  January  respectively. The Government furnished its observations in communications dated  and  December  and  February .
.Bolivia has ratified both the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ), and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complaints presented in this case concerned the repression suffered by the trade union movement following the change of government on  July . The allegations principally concerned the violent death of certain trade union leaders, including Gualberto Vega and the many detentions of trade union leaders and activists. Thus the external co-ordination secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers supplied a list of more than  persons who had been arrested, which had been transmitted to the Government for its observations. The allegations also concerned the dissolution by administrative authority of the Bolivian Central of Workers and almost all the trade union organisations. For its part, the ICFTU denounced the arrests of the members of a humanitarian mission which had been sent to Bolivia and the confiscation of $, which had been destined for assistance to the families of the imprisoned trade unionists.
.At its session in November , the Governing Body, on the recommendation of the Committee, noted that a representative of the Director-General had visited the country to examine the trade union situation on the spot, jointly with the Government. The Governing Body expressed its concern at the gravity of certain allegations and recalled as a general principle that a truly free and independent trade union movement could only develop where fundamental human rights were respected. Furthermore, the Governing Body urged the Government to supply its observations on the allegations concerning the death of trade union leaders and to communicate information on the precise circumstances of these deaths if it were true that these persons were no longer alive. It also noted that certain persons mentioned by the complainants had been released but that a significant number of other persons had either been restricted to specified towns or exiled.
.As a consequence, the Governing Body recalled the principles and considerations to which it was committed concerning measures of arrest, restriction to specified towns and exile, and in particular, the importance of appropriate judicial safeguards, and it asked the Government to supply information on the present position of the other trade unionists mentioned in the complaints. It also called the Government's particular attention to Article  of Convention No. , ratified by Bolivia, according to which workers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved by administrative authority and it expressed the hope that the Bolivian trade unions would soon be returned to their previous status, that the proposed new legislation would be in full conformity with Conventions Nos.  and  and that in revising the trade union legislation the Government would, as it had indicated was its intention, seek the advice and co-operation of the ILO. It requested the Government to supply information on the progress made in the adoption of this legislation and on the evolution of the trade union situation. The Governing Body noted furthermore that the members of the ICFTU who were arrested during a mission to Bolivia had been released and expelled but, in the absence of observations from the Government on this point, it had requested it to provide",0,1980,Bolivia (Plurinational State of
410,"examination detailed replies to detailed factual charges.
.While noting the Government's communication of  June , the Committee regrets that it has not received the detailed information which it requested.
.The Committee deeply deplores the deaths and murders of the trade union leaders and workers mentioned by the complainant and expresses its concern at the seriousness of the remaining allegations, which refer, in particular, to the ill-treatment and arrests of many trade union officials and workers, threats, violent interference in trade union meetings and attacks on trade union property and premises.
.The Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that a free and independent trade union movement can develop only under a regime which guarantees fundamental human rights' and requests the Government to adopt a policy for the taking of special measures to fully guarantee the right to personal safety, adequate protection against unjustified arrest and detention, the right of assembly and demonstration for trade union purposes, and the protection of trade union premises and property.
.The Committee requests the Government to inform it of developments in the situation, particularly with respect to the arrested trade union leaders.",0,1980,Guatemala
411,"information on the alleged confiscation of a sum of money carried by members of the mission.
.The Committee notes the Government's statement that on  November  there were no more political prisoners and arrested trade unionists in prison. Since then, the Committee has received complaints relating to the death of nine persons, including several trade unionists, and to the arrest of several trade union leaders and active trade unionists.
.Firstly, the Committee must note with regret that the inquiries carried out by the Government have not led to the identification of Gualberto Vega. According to the allegations coming from several complainant organisations, it would concern Gualberto Vega Yepura, leader of the Federation of Trade Unions of Mine Workers in Bolivia, representative of the Catavi district, who is said to have died on  July  during attacks by the armed forces. Due to the particular seriousness of this allegation, the Committee considers it necessary that the investigations continue with a view to clarifying the facts and it requests the Government to keep it informed on this point.
.Furthermore, in November , the Committee had expressed the hope that the Bolivian trade unions would be returned to their previous situation and that the proposed new legislation would be in conformity with ILO standards. In this connection, the Committee notes that the Government reiterates its declarations that the Bolivian trade union movement is being organised on the basis of workers' Committees and that the Government gives its assurances that account will be taken of the advice and co-operation of the ILO when its social legislation is revised. The Committee can only insist on the importance of the right of workers to be able to establish and join organisations of their own choosing. It wishes to request the Government to continue to furnish information on developments occurring in the legislative situation.
.In addition, the Committee notes the assurances given by the Government that the sum of money confiscated from the ICFTU delegation will very soon be returned.
.As concerns the allegations of the WCL that , trade unionists employed in the civil service were dismissed, the Committee wishes to point out, while noting the very general observations provided by the Government, that the authorities should not, even during times of political upheaval, undertake anti-trade union activities and should not in particular dismiss trade unionists working in the public sector. The Committee therefore requests the Government to take measures with a view to allowing the workers concerned to be reinstated in their jobs.
.In the absence of comments by the Government on the new allegations concerning the death of nine leaders of the opposition, including Artemio Camargo, and the arrest of trade unionists including Gregorio Andrade, Walter Delgadillo, Pablo Copa and Gloria Ardaya, the Committee requests the Government to furnish detailed information on these aspects of the case.
.In these circumstances, and with regard to the case as a whole, the Committee recommends the Governing Body to adopt the present interim report, and in particular the following conclusions:The Committee would like firstly to express its concern at the gravity of the allegations which continue to be presented to it and to recall that the free and independent trade union movement can only develop where fundamental human rights are respected.The Committee must note with regret that the inquiries carried out by the Government have not led to the identification of the leader of the Federation of Miners, Gualberto Vega, whose death has been alleged. The Committee requests the Government to continue its investigations and to keep it informed on this point. As regards the deaths of the trade union leaders including Artemio Camargo, which allegedly occurred on  January , the Committee urges the Government to provide information on the circumstances surrounding these deaths.The Committee also requests the Government to communicate the most exact information available on the fate of Gregorio Andrade, the peasant leader, Walter Delgadillo, leader of the BCW, Pablo Copa, leader of the Federation of Miners, and Gloria Ardaya, who were allegedly arrested in January .It notes that the sum of money confiscated from the ICFTU delegation will very soon be returned.Regarding the allegations of dismissals of trade unionists in the public service, the Committee wishes to point out that the authorities should not, even during times of political upheaval, undertake anti-trade union activities. It requests the Government to take measures with a view to allowing the workers concerned to be reinstated in their jobs.Finally, as regards the revision of the trade union legislation, the Committee requests the Government to continue to keep it informed of progress made in this connection, and it expresses the firm hope that the legislation so amended will be fully in conformity with the provisions of Conventions Nos.  and , which have been ratified by Bolivia, and will rapidly permit the restoration of freedom of association in the country.
.By communications dated ,  and  July  respectively, the World Confederation of Labour (WCL), the Latin American Central of Workers (CLAT), the Permanent Congress of Trade Union Unity of the Workers of Latin America (CPUSTAL) and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) presented complaints alleging grave violations of trade union rights in Bolivia.
.In addition, the ICFTU, the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU), the International Federation of Free Teachers' Unions (IFFTU) and the CPUSTAL sent information in communications dated , ,  and  July, and the Miners' International Federation and the WCL sent communications on  and  August. Finally, up-to-date lists of persons who had been arrested were transmitted by the WCL on  September and by the External Co-ordination Secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers on  October. On  September the ICFTU sent a telegram containing further allegations.
.In view of the seriousness of the allegations, the Director-General, in conformity with the procedure established by the Governing Body and with the agreement of the Chairman of the Governing Body Committee on Freedom of Association, sent the Bolivian Government a telegram on  July asking it to receive a senior official of the ILO to discuss the trade union situation on the spot. The Government agreed on  August, and this mission was carried out from  to  October by Mr. Ian Lagergren, Deputy Chief of the International Labour Standards Department, accompanied by Mr. Daniel de Patoul, ILO associate expert. Since then, the Government has supplied its observations in a communication dated  October  and transmitted to the ILO on  November .
.In essence, the present case is examined in the light both of the information obtained by the representative of the Director-General during his mission, and of the above-mentioned observations of the Government.
.Bolivia has ratified the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention,  (No. ) and the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention,  (No. ).
.The complainant organisations have given a general picture of the harsh repression suffered by the trade union movement following the military coup d'Etat on  July .
.In particular, they expressed their profound concern at the reported murders of certain trade union leaders and the many detentions of trade union leaders and activists, the torture and maltreatment of detainees, the occupation and demolition of the headquarters of the Bolivian Central of Workers (COB), the dissolution of trade unions, the confiscation of their assets, and their fears as to the fate of trade union leaders Juan Lechin, Executive Secretary of the COB, and Simn Reyes, a leader of the Miners' Federation. A number of organisations requested the sending of a direct contacts mission and the intervention of the ILO to obtain the release of the imprisoned trade union leaders.
.According to the ICFTU communication of  July,  trade union leaders had been shot and  active members of the COB arrested.
.In its communication of  July the IFFTU denounces the prohibition by the Government of two teachers' unions (rural and urban).
.The WCL communication of  August alleges that the leader of the Miners' Federation, Gualberto Vega, has been murdered and that  persons have bees arrested; a list of these, which was supplied by the External Co-ordination Secretariat of the Bolivian Central of Workers has been conveyed to the Government. According to the WCL, the number of arrests exceeds ,,  of them immediately after the change of government. Still according to the WCL, the Minister of the Interior, Luis Arce Gmez, admits that  persons have been arrested and that other arrests are still being made. In particular, the complainant organisation condemns the use of tanks and aviation in the mining areas where Gualberto Vega is said to have been killed; it expresses concern at the ill-treatment inflicted on Juan Lechin and Simn Reyes and at the hardships suffered by the wounded, who, when taken to hospital, are said to have been kidnapped and sent to camps of the General Staff.
